0,The New York Times,nytimes,Scientists say a microscopic battle between fungus and bacteria on the skin of hedgehogs provides evidence that antibiotic resistance can occur in nature. https://nyti.ms/3F6j0Er,https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3F6j0Er%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1932Aegb7UgVACTvA1jxYvi0kgfwdml0tsY99o2TbTgMwAMz24mqX2-v4&h=AT24ihBJmx4KF70EB5sN_QY9foGHl6Ac-AnHmYwlXQ0boBzN2Bf-mgVbPvnim4oGtUKp9dpXf56Bshr6qmVaYB-lB_G9I55kIv7wu4yd3goMLs1llmPFa_rjqQJyZltlzthXon5byyi-ul19D0qS&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT36k41T8EGgKrHdTor5BmyuVnIXisxmhJJBALSGqRn-wxTyEAijPEYbmkYIwSgTF2E4rS8XOSAdOPuXTkVQfhPC0KwlrRy6QBT1F3NnPUUfBWMcxtnoDvRlAwr42kZsoP6yWtwMvA9HE2NeAd2i5z_wJAAilu5-OYutw-_pRoRyJ6f7,9h,"The tiny, spiny and adorable hedgehog is helping to upend conventional wisdom about the origins of drug-resistant bacterial infections that kill thousands of people each year. In a study published Wednesday in Nature, a group of international scientists found that the bacteria that cause a tough-to-treat infection existed in nature long before modern antibiotics began to be mass produced in the 1940s. The drugs have saved countless lives, but the wide distribution of antibiotics in the decades since then has also spurred an evolutionary arms race with the pathogens they target, leading to the emergence of dreaded superbugs that have evaded our efforts to vanquish them with pharmaceuticals. The key to the scientists’ paradigm-altering theory? Danish roadkill. When researchers examined hundreds of dead hedgehogs from Denmark and other countries in Western Europe, they found MRSA, or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, living on the skin of the vast majority of the animals. That was surprising, given that the animals had not been exposed to penicillin, though MRSA does colonize many mammals, including humans, where they can live harmlessly inside the nose or on the skin. The danger arises when these bacteria enter the bloodstream through a wound or intravenous tube, with potentially deadly consequences for those with weakened immune systems. The scientists were also intrigued by another pathogen they found on many of those same hedgehogs: a skin fungus that produces a penicillin-like substance which inhibits the growth of staphylococcus aureus. Like modern antimicrobials, this naturally occurring antibiotic is in constant battle with the staph bacteria that compete for nutrients on the hedgehog’s skin. Over time, some of those bacteria developed an ability to outsmart their fungal rivals and thrive on their hedgehog hosts, the study showed. What likely happened next is a familiar tale in the annals of infectious disease. The particular strain of MRSA that colonized the hedgehogs, known as mecC-MRSA, later found its way to dairy cows in rural areas where both creatures flourish, and eventually to humans. In Denmark, mecC-MRSA sickens 10 to 30 people a year. Through genetic coding of the hedgehog-borne mecC-MRSA, researchers were able to establish a timeline of its evolution back to the early 1800s, long before Alexander Fleming stumbled on a speck of mold in a petri dish that was repelling a spreading Staphylococcus colony. Anders Rhod Larsen, a microbiologist and a lead author of the paper, said the findings added a new wrinkle to the predominant narrative that the overuse of antibiotics was solely responsible for the rise of superbugs. “The main message is that MRSA predates antibiotic use in humans, but the broader theme is that we are not alone in this world,” said Dr. Larsen, who leads the National Reference Laboratory for Antimicrobial Resistance at Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen. “Antibiotic resistance does not have any boundaries and it can be transmitted between species.” Researchers not involved with the study said the findings helped to confirm long-held assumptions about the dynamics of antibiotic resistance. Antimicrobial substances, after all, are abundant in nature, and bacteria and fungi have long found ways to outsmart these compounds. Lance Price, who leads the Antibiotic Resistance Action Center at George Washington University, commended the research for documenting the process in the real world, and with such precision. “This is such an interesting story because who doesn’t love hedgehogs,” he said. “But what’s important about this paper is it shows the natural evolution of a drug-resistant human pathogen.” Tara C. Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University College of Public Health who studies livestock-associated MRSA, said the study helped highlight the role that animals played as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance. “It really just steps up the need for better antibiotic stewardship and to take heed of what we’re using, both in human medicine and animal medicine,” she said. The MRSA that infected the hedgehogs did not appear to sicken them, but its overwhelming presence on the animals sampled from Denmark largely corresponded with mecC-MRSA’s prevalence among humans in that country. First discovered in 2011, mecC-MRSA has since spread to dairy herds across northern Europe and it can sometimes cause infections in cows but has rarely sickened humans. Jesper Larsen, another lead author of the paper and a senior researcher at Statens Serum Institut, said the results had already inspired him and other researchers to expand their focus on antibiotic resistance in wild animals. But he cautioned against any notion that naturally occurring resistance somehow lessened the urgency to curb the use of antimicrobial drugs to treat illness in humans. “The lesson here is that when we overuse antibiotics, we accelerate what is already happening in nature,” he said. There is perhaps another lesson from the study, Dr. Larsen added. Although the risks of humans contracting MRSA directly from hedgehogs are likely minimal, maintaining a healthy distance from the animals was always prudent. “If you see a hedgehog in your backyard,” he said, “you should probably avoid kissing it.” And responsible pet hedgehog owners already knew that it’s best not to snuggle with the animals."

This thing I learned sounds trivial, a practice so simple you’d think there’d be no need for special instruction — which is probably why a lot of us go through life not knowing that there is a particular technique to getting it right. What is this dark art? I learned the proper way to relax. I don’t mean that I discovered the benefits of taking it easy or of remaining calm in the face of adversity and letting life’s troubles slide off my back. I mean it more literally: I learned how to relax my muscles, to purposefully, systematically isolate each part of my body and loosen the meat on my bones. And I learned that doing so regularly, once or several times a day, can be more or less instantly life changing. For me, deliberate muscle relaxation immediately reduces fatigue, stress and anxiety. It creates a kind of allover refreshed feeling that can be attained nearly anywhere and at any time. And it gets more effective the more I do it. I have come to think of relaxation as a skill; the more I relax, the better I learn which parts of my body tend to become tense, what that tension feels like and how to unlock that tension with a quick flick of the mind. This might sound like New Age nonsense, but the benefits of muscle relaxation have been studied for decades, and research has found that versions of the practice may mitigate a wide range of physical and mental conditions — among them generalized anxiety disorder, hypertension, irritable bowel syndrome, insomnia, chronic pain, postpartum depression, some symptoms of schizophrenia, some side effects of cancer treatment, stress among students and anger and aggression in adolescents. But enough about what relaxation does. Here’s how to do it. One of the most widely used methods is known as progressive muscle relaxation, which was developed early last century by Edmund Jacobson, a medical doctor who pioneered research into the connection between physical tension and mental well-being. Jacobson’s insight was that a moderately tense muscle is indistinct — that is, one often does not notice, in ordinary life, that certain muscles are in a state of tension. His method for relaxation is thus a two-step process. First, learn to recognize what a particular muscle feels like when it is flexed. Then, focusing on that muscle in the flexed state, do the opposite of flexing: Relax. When you’re starting out with muscle relaxation, it can be helpful to set aside time and space to do it. Find 10 or 15 minutes in the day when you’re unlikely to be disturbed. Look for a quiet spot where you can lie down on a bed or sit on a couch. Close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths. Now begin: Start at your extremities — say, your hands. Clench them and focus your mind on what that feels like. What is the physical sensation of a clenched fist? Which muscles are activated, and what does their activation feel like? After you have spent a few seconds focusing on the clench, you will be able to do the opposite. As you exhale (I’ve found that relaxation is best achieved on an out breath), gently unclench your fist. Let go of the tension. Feel your hand loosening, becoming heavy, falling into relaxation. After repeating this a few times, you can move on to other parts. Your arms: Flex your biceps, feel the flex and then let go. Your shoulders: Shrug, then unshrug. Your mouth: Smile wide and feel the pull of your smile muscles, then let your smile go limp. Go on like this through your whole body, tensing and relaxing, and by the end of it, I promise, you’ll notice something. At first, it may be just a sense of calm, but the more you do it, the deeper into relaxation you’ll fall, eventually reaching a state of such blissful ease that it can feel hard to stop. On a weeklong beach vacation last summer, I spent an hour or more each day just relaxing — reveling in the euphoria of a body at maximum slack. Muscle relaxation has also become my go-to way of going to bed. I used to have a lot of trouble falling asleep; now I lie down, breathe in and out in a slow rhythm and focus on letting all tension flow out of my limbs. I usually fall asleep within 20 minutes. A few years ago, I wrote about how daily meditation had helped me cope with the chaos of digital life. I still meditate quite often, but I recognize that meditation is not for everyone. Many people find it close to impossible to quiet the mind; a lot of people told me they found the practice so hard that they gave up after one or two sessions. Muscle relaxation is related to meditation — quieting the body is an important part of quieting the mind — but it is much easier to get into and a lot more portable. After your first few practices, you’ll begin to achieve mastery over your tension, to sense how you’re unconsciously tightening parts of your body during the course of a day. Once you begin to recognize that feeling, muscle relaxation can become an allover, all-the-time activity. Unless you’re operating heavy machinery, being pursued by a bear or otherwise facing imminent danger, you can generally relax whenever you like. I find myself consciously relaxing everywhere, anytime — in the checkout line at the supermarket, say, or while on hold with my insurance company. And now that I’m done singing the praises of relaxation, I suppose I’ll go off to relax right now. Farhad wants to chat with readers on the phone.

3,The New York Times,nytimes,"As Kazakhstan erupted in violence and protests, its president asked Russia for aid. That choice could alter the balance of power in Central Asia.",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3f4KCzp%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1DNOBjfjw7d6CDT5ZejUuk_t9iMFAKW7rqLXCbSF_vktrYcDflJUIn0bU&h=AT0Weca-f_9IkksZbs8F9q-38thxWHAj1tO4hDjXDdFyK6pkBe4VrSCtqrpk7_Je6PxcW-KaJo5WowJHRHp1bOLpaTSiK3ThbwC6z38w_pwfdlf9iYJLsLPnjasRxk647qm21YOHrWU8kGswz3Hl&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT3_OUNRIjzNI6HNXpBOvK3w6fCXKYhvjb3pRBpwOLBWQ_AmQ8QponJr3jZIx-ddXlADthqOCGR3Gdv66FtfyyFfw11Rrn1rHspONgy42DT_sNUhLBrrsMApSQjjOPVuX3wMBa81xdMLFPDZSkkB32e68J_NebcGRurc8oYuHL-R6em2,11h,"MOSCOW — The embattled president of Kazakhstan has the pedigree of an international technocrat. The son of prominent intellectuals, he studied in Moscow at a premier academy for diplomats, and later worked in the Soviet Embassy in Beijing. He served as a key adviser to the strongman who ruled the oil-rich Central Asian country as a fief for nearly three decades — and then, in 2019, became his heir. The rise of Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to the presidency was looked at as a possible model by other authoritarian regimes on how to conduct a leadership transition without losing their grip on power. Instead, Kazakhstan erupted in violence this week and Mr. Tokayev has overseen a ruthless crackdown on protesters while ousting his former benefactor, Nursultan Nazarbayev, 81, from his last foothold of authority, as head of the nation’s powerful security council. For support, Mr. Tokayev has turned to another autocrat: President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. It is too soon to know for certain whether Kazakhstan’s moment of crisis will be a victory for Mr. Putin, who quickly responded to Mr. Tokayev’s request for help by sending troops as part of a Russia-led effort to quell the uprising. Moscow has a history of sending “peacekeeping” forces to countries that never leave. And Mr. Putin is intent on maintaining a sphere of Russian influence that includes former Soviet republics like Kazakhstan.  But analysts and experts on Central Asia say that when his government was under siege and his own position was teetering, Mr. Tokayev, 68, was neither powerful enough nor independent enough to go it alone. And his swift alignment with Moscow portends potentially transformative changes in a region that has seen fierce jockeying for influence among the United States, Russia and China. In effect, analysts said, against a backdrop of chaos and violence, Mr. Tokayev chose Russia to ensure his own political survival. The Kazakh president “traded his country’s sovereignty to Russia for his own power and the interests of kleptocratic elites,” said Erica Marat, a professor at National Defense University, a military university in Washington. This move “is really about making Kazakhstan a more submissive, more loyal partner,” she said, adding that Kazakhstan would “have to be more aligned with Russia against the West in geopolitical and global matters.” In a menacing speech on Friday, in which he warned that government security forces could shoot to kill to suppress protests, Mr. Tokayev displayed deference to Mr. Putin, offering special thanks to the Russian leader for providing assistance “very promptly and, most importantly, warmly, in a friendly way.” He again expressed “special gratitude” to Russia in a phone call with Mr. Putin on Saturday, the Kremlin said. But the relationship between the two leaders features a significant imbalance in stature: At a news conference last month in Moscow, Mr. Putin seemed unable to remember Mr. Tokayev’s name. Mr. Tokayev took office, handpicked by Mr. Nazarbayev, pledging to turn the autocracy into a “listening state” that was “overcoming the fear of alternative opinion.” His transformation almost three years later to a leader promising this week to “fire without warning” at the protesters, is a drastic one, said Luca Anceschi, a professor of Eurasian Studies at the University of Glasgow. “He has become a truly authoritarian leader, projecting power which he doesn’t really have,” Dr. Anceschi said. “If you have to rely on power from Russia, are you powerful?” he added. When protests turned violent this week, Mr. Tokayev responded by dismissing his cabinet and ousting Mr. Nazarbayev, who had retained great influence as the “leader of the nation,” the chairman of the ruling Nur Otan party and the head of the nation’s security council. Mr. Tokayev also fired Mr. Nazarbayev’s key allies from prominent roles in the country’s vast security apparatus. Then pitched battles broke out. The timing of the shift from the initial, peaceful protests in the country’s West to the violence and looting in Almaty — which intensified after Mr. Nazarbayev and his loyal head of the country’s powerful intelligence agency, Karim Masimov, were fired — has given rise to widespread speculation that the rioters were organized by proxies for feuding factions of the political elite, pitting Mr. Nazarbayev and his allies against Mr. Tokayev. Into the security vacuum, at Mr. Tokayev’s request, came elite troops — mostly Russian — from a Kremlin-sponsored alliance called the Collective Security Treaty Organization, Russia’s version of NATO. Internally, Mr. Tokayev’s decision to welcome the soldiers, tanks and airplanes from the alliance could further erode public trust in the president. Many working-class Kazakhs have long been furious at the corruption that funnels the wealth from Central Asia’s biggest economy to an elite few. Seeing a leader who supported and benefited from that system, and now chooses to be propped up by Moscow instead of listening to genuine grievances, will infuriate ordinary Kazakhstanis, Dr. Marat said. “People did not come on the streets to ask for Russian interference in their daily lives,” she said. For Mr. Putin, dispatching troops to Kazakhstan represents “a low-cost engagement with high returns,” Dr. Marat said.  For decades, Mr. Tokayev built a reputation as an effective technocrat adept at helping Mr. Nazarbayev balance Kazakhstan’s foreign policy between its increasingly assertive neighbors, China and Russia, and its powerful economic investor, the United States. And for 28 years, he was effectively Mr. Nazarbayev’s understudy. Since taking office, Mr. Tokayev has not had to contend with real political competition. Under his leadership, there has been a significant crackdown on opposition parties, human rights groups say. And genuine opposition figures are “consistently marginalized,” according to the watchdog Freedom House, while “freedoms of speech and assembly remain restricted.” But now, the president has to contend with apparent rivals inside the top echelons of government — some of the people closest to Mr. Nazarbayev, several analysts said. Days after the protests began on Jan. 2 over ballooning inflation and rising fuel prices, Mr. Tokayev said he would rescind the price increases. But demonstrators had already begun demanding the end of the kleptocratic political system that Mr. Nazarbayev had built and maintained since the country declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By midweek, protesters were shouting, “Shal ket!” — or “Old man out!” — in reference to Mr. Nazarbayev. But then Mr. Tokayev fired the former president and the intelligence agency chief, Mr. Masimov, along with Mr. Nazarbayev’s nephew, who was the agency’s second in command. Mr. Masimov was detained on suspicion of “high treason” on Thursday, the agency — known as the National Security Committee — said in a statement on Saturday. Rioters soon broke into at least one government weapons depot, where they met little resistance, according to local news reports. They raced to take over government buildings and the airport in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city and economic center, where most of the unrest took place. (Elsewhere in the country, especially the West, protests remained peaceful.) Akezhan Kazhegeldin, who served as prime minister of Kazakhstan from 1994 to 1997 but resigned over concerns about corruption, said it was likely that Mr. Tokayev determined that he had “lost control over the military and law enforcement bodies,” leading him to dismiss Mr. Nazarbayev, Mr. Masimov and the government. Mr. Kazhegeldin, who has been in exile for decades, said he was still holding out hope that Mr. Tokayev, who served as his chief of cabinet when he was prime minister, could turn things around. But he warned that it would be a mistake for Mr. Tokayev to continue seeking help from Russia, with whom Kazakhstan shares a 4,750-mile land border. Kazakhstan maintains close relations with Russia, and is a member of the single-market Eurasian Economic Union. Mr. Putin, though, has at times played down Kazakh independence, employing messaging similar to his recent statements on Ukraine. Many Kazakhs view the Soviet era with ambivalence, with some seeing it as an extension of colonial rule. “We don’t need any Russian or Belarusian help to settle the situation in one city, Almaty,” Mr. Kazhegeldin said. “We can use our nation.” Dr. Anceschi, from the University of Glasgow, suggested that the only one with a true choice amid the chaos was Mr. Putin, who decided to back Mr. Tokayev instead of Mr. Nazarbayev and Mr. Masimov. But for Mr. Tokayev, the turn to the Kremlin was an existential choice. The president, Dr. Anceschi said, “didn’t choose Russia, he chose himself.”"

The safe and easy thing to do with a winter preview would be to fill it with those known quantities. But that wouldn’t be much fun. So you’ll have to look elsewhere for “Ozark” (Jan. 21), “Billions” (Jan. 23), “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” (Feb. 18), “Killing Eve” (Feb. 27), “Better Things” (Feb. 28), “Outlander” (March 6), “Atlanta” (March 24), “Bridgerton” (March 26) or “Better Call Saul” (undated but soon). Instead here are, in chronological order, 20 new shows or slightly lower-profile returning shows that look interesting. Try to fit in one or two. If you’re looking for a trend, how about notable actresses playing real-life women in some sort of trouble: Amanda Seyfried as Elizabeth Holmes (“The Dropout”), Lily James as Pamela Anderson (“Pam & Tommy”), Renée Zellweger as the convicted murderer Pam Hupp (“The Thing About Pam”), Julia Garner as the con woman Anna Sorokin (“Inventing Anna”).  Dates subject to change. The most acclaimed anime series of recent years, about young soldiers fighting to save the human race from mysterious and really creepy humanoid giants, begins its final run of episodes. (Crunchyroll, Funimation, Sunday) It may not be your show. But if you have teenagers, there’s a very good chance that this dreamy, graphic suburban soap opera is their show, and that they will maintain that nothing else so profoundly captures the turmoil and contingency of their lives. Zendaya, who won an Emmy for the first season, and Hunter Schafer return in Season 2 as the mentally troubled, lovestruck addict Rue and Jules, the transgender girl she adores. (HBO, Sunday) The actor Michael K. Williams had nearly completed a second season of this documentary series before his death in September. Like an Anthony Bourdain of the hustle, Williams examines “why people do the things they do” when the mainstream economy fails them. His Season 2 subjects include street-level identity thieves and a Baltimore rapper who rose to success on the back of bots. (Vice, Monday) The CW’s latest DC Comics adaptation stars Kaci Walfall, an engaging and authentically teenage actress. (She was 16 when the pilot was shot.) She plays a nerdy military brat who has a Superman fixation and a mysterious past of her own, in a series developed by Ava DuVernay with the “Arrow” producer Jill Blankenship. (CW, Tuesday) It’s an Australian rom-com in the novel setting of Adelaide, starring the American actor Josh Gad, in a more toned-down performance than usual, as an immigrant widower who’s been torn apart by his wife’s death and is morbidly overprotective of his young daughter (Ariel Donoghue). Opposite Gad is the Australian actress Isla Fisher as the love interest who has a particular problem with dating, one that’s strongly hinted at in the title. (Peacock, Jan. 13) Bridget Everett gets the autobiographical you-can-go-home-again-but-it’s-damn-tough treatment in a dramedy set in her real-life hometown, Manhattan, Kan. Hannah Bos and Paul Thureen of the Brooklyn theater company the Debate Society created the show; the veteran improv comedian and musical-theater actor Jeff Hiller stands out as the heartbroken heroine’s unlikely new ally. (HBO, Jan. 16) Set in the red-light-and-drug-squats district of Amsterdam in 1980, this series is based on the popular novels of A.C. Baantjer, featuring the detective Jurre de Cock, played here as an enthusiastic rookie by Waldemar Torenstra. The buddy-cop formulas play out with energy and wit against the colorful backdrop. (MHz Choice, Jan. 18) This Spanish series, the first TV project of the director Alejandro Amenábar (“The Others”), combines seagoing adventure and international political intrigue as a young Spanish diplomat (Álvaro Mel) takes on an American treasure hunter who has appropriated the cargo of a sunken galleon. It’s an international, bilingual production with a difference: The major American characters — a buccaneer and a principled lawyer — are played by the high-caliber performers Stanley Tucci and Clarke Peters. (AMC+, Jan. 20) It’s one thing to make a recovery story that feels authentic to people who have been through it; it’s another to make a recovery story that is, if you’ll excuse the word, entertaining for everyone. Simone Finch, a “Conners” writer, and Jenni Konner of “Girls” try to thread the needle in this melancholy comedy about a young alcoholic (Sofia Black-D’Elia) who comes home to Boston to sober up and cope with her problematic mother (Ally Sheedy). (Freeform, Jan. 20) First announced as an NBC project in 2012, this drama set among the upper crust of 1880s New York was going to be Julian Fellowes’s follow-up to “Downton Abbey.” It finally arrives with a newcomer, Louisa Jacobson (a daughter of Meryl Streep), starring as a country cousin who comes to the city to live with her old-money aunts, played by Christine Baranski and Cynthia Nixon. Carrie Coon plays an arriviste neighbor, and the Broadway-centric cast includes Denée Benton, Michael Cerveris, Linda Emond, Celia Keenan-Bolger, Audra McDonald, Debra Monk, Donna Murphy, Kelli O’Hara and John Douglas Thompson. (HBO, Jan. 24) Alan Tudyk looks to be having a blast playing a crotchety alien in this shaggy, likable science-fiction dramedy. In Season 1, he came to earth to destroy the human race for the good of the planet, but his ship crashed in the Rockies and he was forced to live among us, killing and assuming the form of the first person he came across. Since then, he’s been slowly mellowing, though the destruction of humanity remains on the table in Season 2. (Syfy, Jan. 26) The title would lead you to expect an over-the-top satire of an already over-the-top genre, but this sendup of psycho-thrillers is, in its early episodes, surprisingly understated. It is also promising that it stars Kristen Bell, who, while she has experience in this area (“Scream 4”), is generally one of our most down-to-earth performers. (Netflix, Jan. 28) W. Kamau Bell directed this four-part documentary about Bill Cosby, re-examining his public record and conducting a wide range of interviews, many with people who grew up idolizing the comedian and now wrestle with their feelings about him. (Showtime, Jan. 30) The wonderful Lily James, perhaps still best known for playing Lady Rose on “Downton Abbey,” goes in a different direction in this comic mini-series from Seth Rogen’s production company about the Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee sex tape. Sebastian Stan, best known as the cyborg Bucky Barnes in the Marvel universe, plays Lee. (Hulu, Feb. 2) Shonda Rhimes takes a creator’s credit for the first time in her Netflix tenure, with a glossy mini-series that fictionalizes the story of the socialite scam artist Anna Sorokin a.k.a. Anna Delvey (Julia Garner) and her Boswell, a writer for a glossy New York magazine called Manhattan (Anna Chlumsky). (Netflix, Feb. 11) Into the techno-thriller microclimate that includes “Homecoming,” “Mr. Robot,” “Counterpart” and “Black Mirror” comes this series starring Adam Scott as an employee of a company that has developed an extreme approach to the work-life balance. The dark and quiet tale also features Patricia Arquette, John Turturro and, in a rare series appearance, Christopher Walken. (Another Walken show, the BBC series “The Outlaws,” is due later this spring on Amazon Prime Video.) (Apple TV+, Feb. 18) A lot of good TV shows don’t win awards, but it’s particularly galling that this sharp and compelling drama about the crack cocaine trade in Los Angeles has not been nominated for a single prime-time Emmy across its four seasons. In Season 5, set in 1986, the self-made drug kingpin Franklin Saint (Damson Idris) encounters ever greater obstacles. (FX, Feb. 23) This one isn’t low profile, obviously, but a 12-year gap between seasons gets you special consideration. Returning from the original are Sam Waterston and Anthony Anderson; the half cops, half prosecutors structure; and, presumably, that sound effect. (NBC, Feb. 24) Amanda Seyfried plays the Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, and Naveen Andrews plays her former subordinate and boyfriend, Sunny Balwani, in a dramatization whose timing, two months after Holmes’s fraud conviction, makes you wonder what last-minute tweaks the filmmakers will be able to get in. Speaking of the filmmakers, it’s striking that of the eight executive producers listed in press materials, seven are women, including the showrunner, Elizabeth Meriwether, the creator of “Single Parents” and “New Girl.” (Hulu, March 3) This mini-series came about after the true-crime story it tells, about a Missouri woman implicated in several murders, proved popular on NBC’s “Dateline” and in a subsequent podcast. Normally, that lineage might determine whether or not you would be interested, but in this case there’s an added wrinkle: The central character is played by Renée Zellweger, in just her second significant TV role (after “What/If” on Netflix).

Here’s a look at every sport that will be contested at the Games in China. Mikaela Shiffrin, who won a gold medal in 2014 and 2018, will go for a third, or maybe more. She is still at the top of her game, and in November she tied the career record for World Cup wins in a single discipline, slalom. Petra Vlhova of Slovakia and Lara Gut-Behrami and Michelle Gisin of Switzerland will be challengers as well. In the men’s events, Alexis Pinturault of France has a silver and two bronzes at the Games, but will be looking for gold No. 1 as the reigning World Cup overall champion. The disciplines include downhill, the fastest event; super-G, with more turns added; giant slalom, still more turns; and slalom, the slowest and most technical event. There is also a combined event (downhill and slalom) and a mixed-gender team slalom event. Take the endurance test of cross-country skiing and shake it up every few kilometers by having athletes stop to shoot rifles at targets. Too many misses, and skiers must take a penalty lap. Germany, France, Sweden and Norway should dominate the medals. Joining the four-man, two-man and two-woman events is a race for just one: women’s monobob. The first world champion was crowned this year: Kaillie Humphries, a two-time Olympic gold medalist for Canada now representing the United States. Humphries is also the world champion in the two-woman bob, with Lolo Jones as her pusher. Norway dominates this sport, but the United States claimed its first gold medal in 2018 when Jessie Diggins and Kikkan Randall won the sprint relay. Diggins will be back in 2022. The revered Norwegian Marit Bjorgen has retired from Olympic competition after winning eight gold medals over three Games. For many Americans, who seem to embrace the granite rocks and brooms of curling every four years, a highlight of the 2018 Games was the U.S. men, led by John Shuster, streaking to the gold medal after a somewhat shaky 5-4 start. The Swedish men and Swiss women have been the most successful since then, and Canada is always a contender. The deep Russian team swept the top three spots in the women’s competition at the last world championships, with now 17-year-old Anna Shcherbakova on top. The American Nathan Chen skated a terrible short program four years ago that knocked him out of contention. But he won his third straight gold medal at the worlds this year, and a potential duel with Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan, the 2014 and 2018 Olympic champion, could be a highlight of the Games. In the pairs event, Sui Wenjing and Han Cong could bring the gold to the host nation. In ice dance, Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov of Russia are the world champions. There are six disciplines. In the aerials and the new big air event, skiers launch themselves off a ramp and perform flips and spins. In halfpipe, they perform in a U-shaped bowl, and in slopestyle, they ski down a course with rails and jumps. In moguls, they ski over a bumpy course and are judged on turns, jumps and speed. The only event that is timed instead of judged is ski cross, in which skiers race against one another in groups of four. Canada won four gold medals at the last Games; no other nation had more than one. That team is led by the moguls superstar Mikael Kingsbury, the defending Olympic champion.  N.H.L. players had planned to be back at the Games for the first time since 2014, but the league and the players’ union agreed to not send players to Beijing amid a rise of coronavirus cases that prompted a pause to the N.H.L. season. That will force some of the top expected contenders, including the United States and Canada, to adjust to not having top stars on their men’s teams.  China will also be participating in the men’s event, despite concerns that the team is not nearly good enough to be competitive. In the women’s event, Canada and the United States have won all six gold medals since the sport was added, and five of the six silvers. Finland, Russia and perhaps Switzerland are likely to vie for the bronze. Germans have won 34 of 48 gold medals in this sport over the years, including seven of the last eight. In case you can’t remember, luge is the feet-first sledding race; skeleton is headfirst. To win in Nordic combined, athletes must be great at two very different events: cross-country skiing and ski jumping. After years of Norwegian domination, Germany won all three gold medals at the last Games. Nordic combined is the only Olympic sport without a women’s event, but that may change in 2026. And here’s the headfirst sledding event. The United States does much better here, winning three of the 12 golds awarded so far. (The Americans have never won luge gold.) Germany, Austria and Russia are the countries to watch at the Beijing Games. This is a sport that beats athletes up, thanks to the G-forces and vibrations rattling the sledders. Men jump in “normal hill” and “large hill” competitions, while female jumpers, who joined the Games only in 2018, are limited to normal hill. There is also a mixed-gender team competition being added this year. Some have said that the top of the ski jumping tower, where athletes wait before the exhilarating trip down, is the quietest spot at the Games. Several of the events are the same as in freestyle skiing: big air, halfpipe, slopestyle and snowboard cross (rather than ski cross). There is also a head-to-head giant slalom competition. One of the stars of the 2018 competition, the American halfpipe gold medalist Chloe Kim, will be back to defend her title, with an appearance on “The Masked Singer” under her belt. The three-time gold medalist Shaun White plans to be back as well at age 35. Long-track speedskating, in which athletes normally race two at a time against the clock, is dominated by the Dutch. They won seven of 14 gold medals in 2018 and eight of 12 in 2014. The United States, behind the world champions Joey Mantia and Brittany Bowe, will be looking for a first gold medal since 2010. Short-track, with multiple skaters racing, and sometimes colliding, over a tight course, provided China with its only gold of the 2018 Games. South Korea will also be a major contender. Though the United States picks up medals here and there, it has not won a gold since Apolo Ohno did in 2006 and 2002."
6,The New York Times,nytimes,The Winter Olympics in Beijing are right around the corner (Feb. 4). Here’s a look at every sport at the Games. https://nyti.ms/3faXWC9,https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3GdBkgo%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2WRKK9ENy75L-1gIJ9KHo4Loo4oF-g-BNwlKaAk3ZFk18TsFDm4pY3aJ8&h=AT1cNQ8qFGaLyYqJr87iJbsK06qHw5B8dmfFuV4EwY542D0ZiDk_AHdfX1RXQgFu1Ok8EMw_nqrV0X4Fz50ibZmCaVlUmiN7B13cm4Ue0wmJPnQnWUWigHUhXAsZx-tmVR-9_5OFuPIWpKaVhYGN&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT1elV32NKcD3wvp92KmMLzhzkYklWXwFqXApu7p47o6pm2YeO9cFQYEGJVaCrzOaJaVDLRDoyFAfdvfYycyaRMeG502WgB0ct6RMasNoDYFCRYghCAterI6_zj3IMHZSCK4x_668en4suv9CvKHD3E2feaJJ_00WEsl7tHlEYI4NNHl,14h,"STEVENS PASS, Wash. — Skiing is an endangered sport, caught between a warming planet and a global pandemic. But there’s a boom in one corner of the ski world that’s being driven, at least in part, by a combination of climate change and Covid. The unexpected upturn shows how skiers are adapting to the dual crises and how one winter sport is evolving as snow cover declines around the world. Ski touring, or uphill skiing, a hybrid style that combines elements of cross country and downhill, has been popular in Europe for decades. In the United States, though, it’s traditionally been a sport for mountaineers and extreme athletes, who use the special skis to trek uphill and into the backcountry in search of untouched powder. That changed when the pandemic shut down ski resorts in 2020. Sales of touring gear in the United States spiked as recreational skiers searched for ways to get uphill without lifts. Over a million people in the United States used touring equipment last year, even as most ski lifts reopened, with sales of the specialized gear rising 260 percent between November 2019 and the same month a year later, according to the market research firm NPD Group. “It’s not linear growth,” said Drew Hardesty, a skier and forecaster at the Utah Avalanche Center. “It’s exponential.” Tour skiers use removable traction strips called skins on their skis and adjustable bindings with free heels that allow them to walk. To descend, they remove the skins and lock in the heels for downhill runs. The sport was born in Europe as a practical means of winter transportation, with the predecessors of today’s tour skis appearing as early as the 16th century. Uphill skiing is “part of the fabric of the culture” in Europe, according to Drew Saunders, a senior manager at Oberalp Group, the mountain sports company that owns the Dynafit and Pomoca ski brands. “The European market is almost a generation ahead of us in terms of the maturity and sophistication and ski touring in general,” Mr. Saunders said. Ski touring began to trickle into the American mainstream in the mid-2000s, when videos of wild backcountry descents in places like the Himalayas, the high Andes and the Arctic began to circulate on the internet. “Back then, there was barely anyone doing it,” said Ingrid Backstrom, a professional skier who has helped to popularize backcountry skiing in the United States through films of her runs on remote slopes. “The equipment was harder to find, more expensive and didn’t work as well.” In recent years, with snow cover diminishing and untouched powder increasingly difficult to reach, skiers like Ms. Backstrom have been pushed onto groomed trails more often. That increased visibility, combined with the pandemic shutdowns, she said, has prompted more skiers to try touring gear. “That always helps to have a visible example,” she said. Ms. Backstrom also said more skiers are opting to avoid the backcountry and ski uphill on managed slopes because it’s “more safe given extreme changes in climate and weather.” One of the main reasons is that, as weather becomes more volatile, avalanches are becoming more difficult to predict. For instance, much of the work done by Mr. Hardesty, the forecaster, is based on his previous observations and scientists’ computer modeling of past avalanches. But, he said, “the old hard drive isn’t necessarily going to be accurate at looking at the avalanches that we’re going to be seeing.” He also said avalanche threats were amplified by wildfires, which are being worsened by extreme heat and dryness linked to climate change. “Increased layers of ash and dust within the snowpack create weak layers” that can cleave into avalanches, Mr. Hardesty said, and can accentuate the melting of the snowpack in general. For Ms. Backstrom, whose brother was killed in a skiing accident, the safety considerations are increasingly pressing. “Now that we have two little kids, I’m very choosy about my backcountry days because of the risk of it and the risk of avalanches,” she said. She now sometimes chooses to stay on resort runs, even when the snow conditions would enable her to traverse the backcountry. “It’s a straightforward way to hike up and exercise, have that freedom and feel the fun of skiing back down,” she said. Beyond making backcountry skiing less safe, climate change is also making it harder to traverse unmanaged terrain for a growing portion of the season as snow cover diminishes. Many North American ski resorts have spent much of this season relying almost entirely on artificial snow. “Normally there would be enough snow to at least go attempt to tour in the backcountry by now,” said Tristan Droppert, head of United States marketing for Black Crows, a ski manufacturer, in late December. “And this year, it’s still almost impossible.” In Colorado, where ski touring is especially popular among endurance athletes, skiers have been confined to a sharply limited range of terrain. Copper Mountain, the training ground for the United States Ski Team, was only 50 percent open in the days leading up to Christmas. The resort has quadrupled the number of uphill ski routes for ski touring, but the majority of the trails are being supplemented by artificial snow machines. And at nearby Bluebird Backcountry, a ski area founded last year and dedicated exclusively to uphill skiing, there wasn’t enough snow to open by Christmas. Between 1982 and 2016, the American ski season shrunk by an average of 34 days annually, and levels of snow cover saw an average drop of 41 percent, according to a study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. “We are going to see the continuous shortening of the snow season,” said Xubin Zeng, director of the Climate Dynamics and Hydrometeorology Center at the University of Arizona and lead author of the study. “My best estimate is it will be at least double what we’ve already lost” by 2050. This trend will continue to affect not only skiing, but farming, fishing and wild ecosystems that rely on regular snow cover. With that in mind, the industry is grappling with whether to adapt to the changing conditions or try to overcome them with new infrastructure and artificial snow. China and the International Olympic Committee are preparing for the 2022 Winter Games on sites that will very likely use 100 percent artificial snow. About 49 million gallons of water will be needed to create the conditions necessary for the events, according to a 2019 estimate, a decision some have criticized as unsustainable. A growing number of uphill skiers say they use touring skis on natural snow as a reflection of their values. “Powder is one of the natural wonders of the world,” Ms. Backstrom said. “It’s just a pure miracle of nature, and you can’t replicate that in any way, shape or form.” Hanging on to those values may require further adjustments as snow cover continues to thin. “We’re probably going to have to walk for a while in the dirt and our shoes,” Mr. Droppert said of ski touring in coming years, “and then strap on skis and skins.” “But we’re always going to ski, even if it means we have to walk in the mud.”"

He was 88. His wife, Arabella Chavers Julien, said the cause was cardiopulmonary arrest. “The Mack” is the story of Goldie, a young man who is framed and sent to jail, and who upon his release aims to make his fortune and his name by becoming a pimp. (The word “mack” is an Americanization of “maquereau,” French street slang for pimp.) It’s a hero’s journey, played out on the mean streets of Oakland, Calif., a real-life war zone in the early 1970s presided over by Black crime lords and Black militants, who battled each other for turf. Mr. Julien’s Goldie had a gentle gravitas and a kinetic sidekick, portrayed by Richard Pryor. Mr. Julien said that he and Mr. Pryor, working off a story written in prison by an actual convict, wrote much of the screenplay, though they did not receive credit onscreen. In the decades since its release, “The Mack” has accrued legions of devotees who can recite its lines verbatim. Artists like Snoop Dogg, Too Short and others have sampled its dialogue in their work. Quentin Tarantino paid homage to it in his script for the 1993 film “True Romance.” In 2013, when the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art held a screening in honor of the film’s 40th anniversary, Mr. Tarantino lent his vintage 35-millimeter print. “The film is a blaxploitation classic,” Todd Boyd, chair for the study of race and popular culture at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts, said in an interview. Part of the film’s legend is that Oakland’s crime boss, Frank Ward, gave the filmmakers his protection so they could shoot there. (He has a cameo as himself, dispensing pimp wisdom in a barbershop scene as a barber tends to his kingly locks.) The movie’s vernacular and its rituals were authentic, and they still fascinate, as do the clothes. Goldie’s single-breasted white fur maxi-coat was a character in its own right. (Years later, Russell Simmons, the hip-hop mogul, would offer Mr. Julien $10,000 for it, Mr. Julien told The Los Angeles Times in 2004. It now lives in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture.) Mr. Julien had a hand in the film’s costumes and made sure they were crafted by local Black clothing designers, he said in a 2002 documentary about the film. While the blaxploitation genre was problematic for some — Junius Griffin, then president of the Hollywood branch of the N.A.A.C.P., coined the term and described its themes as “just another form of cultural genocide” — urban Black audiences flocked to movies like “The Mack.” (The Los Angeles Times noted in 2013 that it was released in only 20-odd theaters in African American communities but quoted its director, Michael Campus, as saying it did better in those cities than “The Godfather” and “The Poseidon Adventure.”) Such movies “were critic-proof,” Dr. Boyd said. “People were not reading Pauline Kael reviews to determine if they should go see these films.” Melvin Van Peebles had set the tone with “Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song,” his independently made 1971 box-office hit about a performer in a sex show turned revolutionary. Gordon Parks’s “Shaft,” less transgressive but still wildly popular, appeared the same year. By the late 1970s, the blaxploitation category had fizzled out. A decade later, young cinephiles and hip-hop artists would devour VHS tapes of “The Mack” and other gems from that era — a trove of movies with powerful Black imagery that also included “Super Fly” and “Black Caesar.” “Because of Hollywood’s racism,” Dr. Boyd said, “at the time there was just not that much else. And the tale of an underworld figure like Goldie, working outside the system, was enormously appealing to the young rising stars of a new musical genre, gangsta rap.” Mr. Julien worked as a screenwriter, too. “Cleopatra Jones” (1973), which he wrote, featured a different kind of hero, on the right side of the law. It starred the statuesque Tamara Dobson as a machine-gun-toting, martial-arts-swirling model and undercover agent on a mission to rid her community of drugs. (Shelley Winters played a drug lord named Mommy.) He also wrote “Thomasine & Bushrod,” a lightly feminist western, released in 1974, and starred in it with Vonetta McGee, his girlfriend at the time. The film brings to mind a sweeter and goofier version of the 1967 movie “Bonnie & Clyde.” Mr. Julien said he was inspired by the exploits of a great-grandfather, a bank robber named Bushrod, to turn his family history into a love story. Maxwell Julien Banks was born on July 12, 1933, in Washington. His father, Seldon Bushrod Banks, was an airline mechanic. His mother, Cora (Page) Banks, was a restaurant owner. She was murdered in her home in 1972, and Mr. Julien said that his grief over her death influenced his performance in “The Mack.” He won a basketball scholarship to Southern University in Baton Rouge, La., where he spent a year before transferring to Howard University. He joined the Air Force in 1955 and served as an air traffic controller before beginning his acting career. He took his middle name as his stage name because he felt it sounded more theatrical than Banks. Mr. Julien played a Black militant in “Getting Straight,” a much-panned 1970 drama about campus unrest starring Elliott Gould and Candice Bergen, and appeared in “Uptight,” a 1968 update of the 1935 movie “The Informer” written by Ruby Dee and directed by Jules Dassin. He also acted on television.  He and Ms. Chavers Julien married in 1991. She is his only immediate survivor. As much as Mr. Julien enjoyed the accolades from generations of “The Mack” fans — he appeared as a suave, pimplike elder in the 1997 comedy “How To Be a Player” — he told Dr. Boyd that he often felt his Goldie character overshadowed his own persona. Early on, he also disliked the term “blaxploitation,” which he felt diminished his work. “The average white audience has had opportunities to explore every facet of their existence by now,” he told The Atlanta Journal Constitution in 1974, the year “Thomasine & Bushrod” was released. “No one ever talks about white exploitation films. If ‘The Sting’ had been done by Ron O’Neal” — the star of “Super Fly” — “and Max Julien, everyone would have called it Black exploitation. A 10-year-old kid came up to us in Baltimore and thanked us for making the picture. He said he’d read about Black cowboys all his life, but didn’t believe it until he saw it on the screen.” He added: “Blacks didn’t want to see ‘Sounder’” — the 1972 film taken from the book of the same name about a poor Black boy, his dog and the grim travails of his sharecropping family in the 1930s. “That’s not the image they want. They’ve seen that image all their life.”"

The safe and easy thing to do with a winter preview would be to fill it with those known quantities. But that wouldn’t be much fun. So you’ll have to look elsewhere for “Ozark” (Jan. 21), “Billions” (Jan. 23), “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” (Feb. 18), “Killing Eve” (Feb. 27), “Better Things” (Feb. 28), “Outlander” (March 6), “Atlanta” (March 24), “Bridgerton” (March 26) or “Better Call Saul” (undated but soon).

If you’re looking for a trend, how about notable actresses playing real-life women in some sort of trouble: Amanda Seyfried as Elizabeth Holmes (“The Dropout”), Lily James as Pamela Anderson (“Pam & Tommy”), Renée Zellweger as the convicted murderer Pam Hupp (“The Thing About Pam”), Julia Garner as the con woman Anna Sorokin (“Inventing Anna”).  Dates subject to change. The most acclaimed anime series of recent years, about young soldiers fighting to save the human race from mysterious and really creepy humanoid giants, begins its final run of episodes. (Crunchyroll, Funimation, Sunday) It may not be your show. But if you have teenagers, there’s a very good chance that this dreamy, graphic suburban soap opera is their show, and that they will maintain that nothing else so profoundly captures the turmoil and contingency of their lives. Zendaya, who won an Emmy for the first season, and Hunter Schafer return in Season 2 as the mentally troubled, lovestruck addict Rue and Jules, the transgender girl she adores. (HBO, Sunday) The actor Michael K. Williams had nearly completed a second season of this documentary series before his death in September. Like an Anthony Bourdain of the hustle, Williams examines “why people do the things they do” when the mainstream economy fails them. His Season 2 subjects include street-level identity thieves and a Baltimore rapper who rose to success on the back of bots. (Vice, Monday) The CW’s latest DC Comics adaptation stars Kaci Walfall, an engaging and authentically teenage actress. (She was 16 when the pilot was shot.) She plays a nerdy military brat who has a Superman fixation and a mysterious past of her own, in a series developed by Ava DuVernay with the “Arrow” producer Jill Blankenship. (CW, Tuesday) It’s an Australian rom-com in the novel setting of Adelaide, starring the American actor Josh Gad, in a more toned-down performance than usual, as an immigrant widower who’s been torn apart by his wife’s death and is morbidly overprotective of his young daughter (Ariel Donoghue). Opposite Gad is the Australian actress Isla Fisher as the love interest who has a particular problem with dating, one that’s strongly hinted at in the title. (Peacock, Jan. 13) Bridget Everett gets the autobiographical you-can-go-home-again-but-it’s-damn-tough treatment in a dramedy set in her real-life hometown, Manhattan, Kan. Hannah Bos and Paul Thureen of the Brooklyn theater company the Debate Society created the show; the veteran improv comedian and musical-theater actor Jeff Hiller stands out as the heartbroken heroine’s unlikely new ally. (HBO, Jan. 16) Set in the red-light-and-drug-squats district of Amsterdam in 1980, this series is based on the popular novels of A.C. Baantjer, featuring the detective Jurre de Cock, played here as an enthusiastic rookie by Waldemar Torenstra. The buddy-cop formulas play out with energy and wit against the colorful backdrop. (MHz Choice, Jan. 18) This Spanish series, the first TV project of the director Alejandro Amenábar (“The Others”), combines seagoing adventure and international political intrigue as a young Spanish diplomat (Álvaro Mel) takes on an American treasure hunter who has appropriated the cargo of a sunken galleon. It’s an international, bilingual production with a difference: The major American characters — a buccaneer and a principled lawyer — are played by the high-caliber performers Stanley Tucci and Clarke Peters. (AMC+, Jan. 20) It’s one thing to make a recovery story that feels authentic to people who have been through it; it’s another to make a recovery story that is, if you’ll excuse the word, entertaining for everyone. Simone Finch, a “Conners” writer, and Jenni Konner of “Girls” try to thread the needle in this melancholy comedy about a young alcoholic (Sofia Black-D’Elia) who comes home to Boston to sober up and cope with her problematic mother (Ally Sheedy). (Freeform, Jan. 20) First announced as an NBC project in 2012, this drama set among the upper crust of 1880s New York was going to be Julian Fellowes’s follow-up to “Downton Abbey.” It finally arrives with a newcomer, Louisa Jacobson (a daughter of Meryl Streep), starring as a country cousin who comes to the city to live with her old-money aunts, played by Christine Baranski and Cynthia Nixon. Carrie Coon plays an arriviste neighbor, and the Broadway-centric cast includes Denée Benton, Michael Cerveris, Linda Emond, Celia Keenan-Bolger, Audra McDonald, Debra Monk, Donna Murphy, Kelli O’Hara and John Douglas Thompson. (HBO, Jan. 24) Alan Tudyk looks to be having a blast playing a crotchety alien in this shaggy, likable science-fiction dramedy. In Season 1, he came to earth to destroy the human race for the good of the planet, but his ship crashed in the Rockies and he was forced to live among us, killing and assuming the form of the first person he came across. Since then, he’s been slowly mellowing, though the destruction of humanity remains on the table in Season 2. (Syfy, Jan. 26) The title would lead you to expect an over-the-top satire of an already over-the-top genre, but this sendup of psycho-thrillers is, in its early episodes, surprisingly understated. It is also promising that it stars Kristen Bell, who, while she has experience in this area (“Scream 4”), is generally one of our most down-to-earth performers. (Netflix, Jan. 28) W. Kamau Bell directed this four-part documentary about Bill Cosby, re-examining his public record and conducting a wide range of interviews, many with people who grew up idolizing the comedian and now wrestle with their feelings about him. (Showtime, Jan. 30) The wonderful Lily James, perhaps still best known for playing Lady Rose on “Downton Abbey,” goes in a different direction in this comic mini-series from Seth Rogen’s production company about the Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee sex tape. Sebastian Stan, best known as the cyborg Bucky Barnes in the Marvel universe, plays Lee. (Hulu, Feb. 2) Shonda Rhimes takes a creator’s credit for the first time in her Netflix tenure, with a glossy mini-series that fictionalizes the story of the socialite scam artist Anna Sorokin a.k.a. Anna Delvey (Julia Garner) and her Boswell, a writer for a glossy New York magazine called Manhattan (Anna Chlumsky). (Netflix, Feb. 11) Into the techno-thriller microclimate that includes “Homecoming,” “Mr. Robot,” “Counterpart” and “Black Mirror” comes this series starring Adam Scott as an employee of a company that has developed an extreme approach to the work-life balance. The dark and quiet tale also features Patricia Arquette, John Turturro and, in a rare series appearance, Christopher Walken. (Another Walken show, the BBC series “The Outlaws,” is due later this spring on Amazon Prime Video.) (Apple TV+, Feb. 18) A lot of good TV shows don’t win awards, but it’s particularly galling that this sharp and compelling drama about the crack cocaine trade in Los Angeles has not been nominated for a single prime-time Emmy across its four seasons. In Season 5, set in 1986, the self-made drug kingpin Franklin Saint (Damson Idris) encounters ever greater obstacles. (FX, Feb. 23) This one isn’t low profile, obviously, but a 12-year gap between seasons gets you special consideration. Returning from the original are Sam Waterston and Anthony Anderson; the half cops, half prosecutors structure; and, presumably, that sound effect. (NBC, Feb. 24) Amanda Seyfried plays the Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, and Naveen Andrews plays her former subordinate and boyfriend, Sunny Balwani, in a dramatization whose timing, two months after Holmes’s fraud conviction, makes you wonder what last-minute tweaks the filmmakers will be able to get in. Speaking of the filmmakers, it’s striking that of the eight executive producers listed in press materials, seven are women, including the showrunner, Elizabeth Meriwether, the creator of “Single Parents” and “New Girl.” (Hulu, March 3) This mini-series came about after the true-crime story it tells, about a Missouri woman implicated in several murders, proved popular on NBC’s “Dateline” and in a subsequent podcast. Normally, that lineage might determine whether or not you would be interested, but in this case there’s an added wrinkle: The central character is played by Renée Zellweger, in just her second significant TV role (after “What/If” on Netflix).

Hace unos años, dijo, escuchó a una joven y exitosa empresaria negra mencionar que nunca asistía a las horas felices con sus colegas a menos de que su jefe le pidiera explícitamente que se uniera. Años de sentir el rechazo que muchos brasileños negros experimentan en entornos predominantemente blancos le habían enseñado a buscar invitaciones claras, explicó la mujer. Trajano, quien es blanca, sintió una punzada de tristeza. Entonces se le pasó por la cabeza un pensamiento incómodo. “En mis fiestas de cumpleaños, no hay mujeres negras”, recordó Trajano que pensó. “Eso es racismo estructural que, en mi caso, no nace del rechazo, sino de no buscarlas”. Ese momento de introspección de Trajano, quien había convertido un pequeño negocio familiar en un gigante de la venta al por menor, ayudó a plantar las semillas de una audaz iniciativa de acción afirmativa corporativa, que ha suscitado elogios, indignación y mucho examen de conciencia en Brasil. Durante los dos últimos años, la sociedad anónima, llamada Magazine Luiza, o Magalu, ha limitado su programa de formación de ejecutivos para recién graduados universitarios —una vía de acceso a puestos de responsabilidad bien remunerados— a postulantes negros. El anuncio, en septiembre de 2020, generó un aluvión de noticias y comentarios. Muchos de ellos fueron críticos. El hashtag #MagaluRacista fue tendencia en Twitter durante días. Un legislador cercano a Jair Bolsonaro, el presidente conservador de Brasil, instó a los fiscales federales a abrir una investigación sobre la empresa, al argumentar que el programa violaba las protecciones constitucionales. Pero Magazine Luiza lo calificó como un paso necesario y una tarea pendiente desde hace mucho tiempo para diversificar sus filas de alto nivel y para expiar el brutal legado del racismo en Brasil, donde la esclavitud no fue abolida hasta 1888. Trajano se convirtió en la defensora más visible y vocal de la política de su empresa. “Más allá de los aspectos económicos y sociales, la esclavitud dejó una marca emocional muy fuerte, que es una sociedad de colonizadores y colonizados”, dijo Trajano, de 70 años. “Mucha gente nunca ha sentido que este sea su país”. Trajano ha causado sensación más allá de las esferas corporativas al hablar sin tapujos de cuestiones como la raza, la desigualdad, la violencia doméstica y las fallas del sistema político. Partidos de todo el espectro político le han pedido que se presente a las elecciones, viendo en ella una rara mezcla de pragmatismo, carisma e inteligencia. “En un mundo en el que los multimillonarios gastan sus fortunas en aventuras espaciales y yates, Luiza se dedica a otro tipo de odisea”, escribió el expresidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva el pasado septiembre en la revista Time, que seleccionó a Trajano como una de las 100 personas más influyentes del mundo. “Ella ha asumido el reto de construir un gigante comercial al mismo tiempo que construye un Brasil mejor”. Trajano nació como hija única en Franca, una ciudad de tamaño medio en las montañas del estado de São Paulo, donde una tía que comparte su nombre abrió una pequeña tienda de regalos en 1957. Mientras el negocio se expandía en un pequeño grupo de tiendas minoristas, Trajano aceptó un trabajo como vendedora en una de las tiendas cuando era adolescente. La experiencia la convirtió en una apasionada del servicio al cliente y de la cultura del trabajo. “Cuando tenía 17 o 18 años se me ocurrieron pequeñas revoluciones para invertir más en los empleados”, dijo. “Empecé a traer un psicólogo a la tienda”. Desde entonces, dice que le fascinan los factores que hacen que los empleados estén motivados y dedicados, y aquellos que hacen lo contrario. Tomó el timón del negocio en 1991 y supervisó una enorme expansión nacional impulsada por el mantra corporativo: “Poner al alcance de muchos lo que ha sido un privilegio para unos pocos”. A medida que Magazine Luiza —que vende un poco de todo, incluyendo artículos para el hogar, electrónica, ropa y productos de belleza— crecía hasta convertirse en un gigante con 1400 tiendas, Trajano dijo que se esforzó por construir una cultura en la que los trabajadores estuvieran comprometidos con el éxito de la marca. Los lunes por la mañana, los empleados de todos los centros de Magazine Luiza se reúnen para cantar el himno nacional, reproduciendo una tradición escolar que Trajano apreciaba cuando era niña. “Se necesitan rituales para mantener una cultura fuerte”, dijo Trajano durante una entrevista en su oficina acristalada de la sede de la empresa en São Paulo. A medida que las ventas al por menor comenzaron a cambiar y a ocurrir en línea, Trajano invirtió mucho en la creación de un mercado digital y un sistema de distribución mientras preparaba a su hijo Frederico Trajano para que en 2016 asumiera la gestión diaria del negocio como director ejecutivo. Ella sigue siendo la presidenta del consejo de administración y su figura más visible. Frederico Trajano, de 45 años, dijo que aprendió de su madre a asumir riesgos y a confiar en su intuición. “A ella le gusta decir: ‘toca en la banda’, no te quedes solo mirando cómo marcha”, dijo. “Eso significa aprender a ser el protagonista de mi propia historia”. Trajano atribuyó a su hijo la idea del programa de prácticas solo para personas negras en 2020, pero señaló que se produjo tras años en los que ella señaló que las clases de prácticas estaban abrumadoramente llenas de participantes blancos. El programa no ha suscitado ni demandas ni ninguna acción gubernamental. Ana Paula Pessoa, una ejecutiva empresarial brasileña que fue directora financiera de los Juegos Olímpicos de 2016 en Río de Janeiro, dijo que la controversia desatada por el programa provocó conversaciones incómodas entre sus pares. “Todas las empresas hablaron de ello y todo el mundo tenía una opinión al respecto”, dijo. “Abrir este debate es esencial porque en Brasil tendemos a tirar las cosas por debajo de la mesa y a mantener estos enormes elefantes en la habitación de los que nadie habla”. La empresa ha redoblado la iniciativa con la divulgación de un documental de 23 minutos sobre el proceso de selección que parece más un programa de telerrealidad que una promoción corporativa. En él se muestra a los aspirantes hablando de las barreras a las que se enfrentaron para poner en marcha sus carreras y muestra a algunos rompiendo a llorar cuando se enteran de que han sido aceptados en el programa. Raíssa Aryadne de Andrade Lima, de 31 años, analista de sostenibilidad del estado de Alagoas que fue admitida en la clase inaugural de prácticas para profesionales negros, dijo que el trabajo fue transformador para ella personal y profesionalmente. “Lo mejor del programa fue que me abrió los ojos a la cantidad de oportunidades que eran posibles para mí”, dijo. El perfil de Trajano ascendió en 2019 después de que la revista Forbes la incluyera por primera vez en su lista de multimillonarios. Ella tomó la etiqueta con incomodidad, dijo Trajano, señalando que las fortunas como la suya pueden subir y bajar en función del rendimiento de las acciones. “Me gusta hacer negocios y cuando lo haces a veces ganas y a veces pierdes”, dijo. Trajano ha dicho enfáticamente que no tiene intención de presentarse a las elecciones. Pero se ha vuelto cada vez más activa en los cambiantes debates políticos a través de un grupo para mujeres líderes que fundó en 2013 con el objetivo de avanzar en la paridad de género en todas las esferas de poder. En la actualidad, el grupo cuenta con más de 101.000 integrantes. Las líderes del grupo están elaborando planes políticos a largo plazo para abordar problemas crónicos en la atención a la salud, la educación, la vivienda y el mercado laboral. También abogan por la paridad de género en la política electoral, lo que, según Trajano, transformaría el sistema disfuncional y polarizado de Brasil. A principios de 2021, mientras el gobierno de Brasil enfrentaba problemas para adquirir las vacunas para la COVID-19 y Bolsonaro sembraba dudas sobre su eficacia, Trajano se convirtió en una implacable defensora de las inoculaciones, movilizando su red de mujeres líderes para presionar al gobierno para que actuara rápidamente y para disipar la desinformación sobre las vacunas. En internet ha habido grandes especulaciones con la posibilidad de que Trajano se convierta en un comodín en las elecciones presidenciales de este año, tal vez como compañera de fórmula de da Silva, el candidato favorito. Aunque ella ha descartado categóricamente desempeñar ese papel, está claro que Bolsonaro ha llegado a verla como una amenaza para sus perspectivas de reelección. En noviembre, pareció deleitarse con que el precio de las acciones de la empresa hubiera caído en los últimos meses en medio de las especulaciones de una asociación política entre Da Silva y Trajano, a la que el presidente se refirió como “socialista”. Más tarde, ese mismo día, cuando se le preguntó a Trajano por el comentario del presidente, dijo que la etiqueta no le parecía ofensiva. “Creo que hay que enfrentarse a la desigualdad social”, dijo. “Si eso es ser socialista, entonces soy socialista”."

A perennial Oscar nominee in the 1960s, Poitier became a movie star at a time when Hollywood tended to relegate Black actors to roles as servants, appearing for just a scene or two, often as comic relief. But he was rarely a supporting player, even at the start of his career. He took leads, specializing in a specific type: the educated, well-mannered, middle-class professional who had assimilated into the parts of white society willing to accept him. Throughout his first two decades in show business, Poitier’s films often promoted powerful messages about the ignorance of bigotry. His charisma and grace made him popular with white and Black audiences alike, and played no small part in easing some of the racial tensions in America — just by giving controversial issues an amiable advocate. These 11 Poitier movies span the ’50s to the ’90s, when he semiretired. They offer a good overview of not just the scope of his career, but of how the country changed during his 50-plus years in show business. After a relatively short stint as a New York stage actor, Poitier made an auspicious big-screen debut in 1950 with the writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s unusual hybrid of social drama and film noir. As a doctor struggling against the ingrained racism of his patients — including a career criminal played by Richard Widmark — Poitier allowed audiences to see what even accomplished Black Americans were facing every day, and how that kind of abuse could rattle a person’s psyche. In Poitier’s best 1950s film, he plays a longshoreman who becomes fast friends with a co-worker (played by John Cassavetes) who’s secretly AWOL from the military. Though one’s an upstanding citizen and the other’s a deserter, they are treated differently by their cruel boss (Jack Warden), who doesn’t like seeing any of his people getting chummy — especially not when one’s white and one’s Black. Less preachy than many of Poitier’s pictures from this era, “Edge of the City” has a bracing naturalism, born of its roots in the adventurous, progressive New York theater and television scenes. In a sublime bit of cultural kismet, the playwright Lorraine Hansberry’s masterpiece arrived when Poitier was the right age to tackle one of theater’s great characters: the pragmatic, prickly Walter Younger. Unlike the softer-edged, friendlier men Poitier had been portraying up to then, Walter doesn’t have much faith in the great dream of integration. He argues with his more idealistic family members about whether they should use a financial windfall to move into a white neighborhood, and his cynicism brings to light arguments that were being had by Black families everywhere in the ’50s and ’60s — except on the big screen. Poitier won a best actor Oscar for “Lilies of the Field” (1963), which would become the first of a short string of films (including “To Sir, With Love” from 1967 and “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner”) in which he played handy, disarming individuals, helping white people improve their attitudes. Most of these movies are more interesting now for how they reveal the subtle racism of well-meaning left-leaning filmmakers, but “A Patch of Blue” is a refreshing exception, and the first movie to watch from this batch. As a kindly soul who helps a poor, abused blind teenager stand up for herself, Poitier is saintly but grounded. And the writer-director Guy Green’s adaptation of an Elizabeth Kata novel is unusually wise about how sometimes class matters as much as race in America. In between his social-issue films, Poitier made plenty of genre pictures where race was a key element of the plot (as in the two-fisted 1958 adventure “The Defiant Ones,” and the 1966 western “Duel at Diablo”). The most popular of these is the best picture-winning “In the Heat of the Night,” in which the actor plays a brilliant Philadelphia homicide detective, Virgil Tibbs, who is drafted to help a small-town Mississippi police department crack a difficult case. Refusing to defer to his virulently prejudiced hosts, Tibbs carries himself as a truly free man, in ways that audiences back in 1967 found thrilling. He’d go on to play the character twice more: in “They Call Me Mister Tibbs!” (1970) and “The Organization” (1971). The critical reputation of this Oscar-winning blockbuster hit has diminished in recent years. It’s been held up as an example of Hollywood’s heavy-handed social messaging — rather than as a groundbreaking interrogation of some purportedly open-minded white and Black families’ conflicted feelings about interracial marriage. Nevertheless, Poitier gave one of his most memorable performances in the film, using his charisma and wit to peck away at the underlying prejudices of the older generation, represented here primarily by characters played by the venerable movie stars Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. The points that the director-producer Stanley Kramer and the screenwriter William Rose are making may be blunt, but Poitier delivers them in electrifying fashion. After acting in films almost nonstop throughout the ’50s and ’60s, Poitier slowed his output from the mid-70s onward, in part because he began working more behind the camera. He made his directorial debut in 1972 with this offbeat western, which arrived toward the start of the blaxploitation era, when the movie industry began to realize the commercial potential of films about self-actualized Black protagonists. Joined by Harry Belafonte and Ruby Dee, a frequent co-star, Poitier cast himself in “Buck and the Preacher” as a skilled scout having lightly comic adventures on the frontier. While attuned to 19th-century racial strife, this film is more an amiable entertainment than a hard-hitting commentary. As such, it has held up better than some of the star’s more incendiary projects. Many of the Black-themed films that filled American theaters in the ’70s were raunchy and R-rated, but Poitier had hits in that era with three PG caper comedies, which he directed and starred in alongside Bill Cosby and a host of A-list African American entertainers. The first in this loose trilogy was “Uptown Saturday Night,” with Poitier and Cosby playing buddies who go on an all-night odyssey through their neighborhood — encountering colorful characters played by the likes of Belafonte, Flip Wilson and Richard Pryor — while searching for a stolen lottery ticket. One of Poitier’s first feature films was a 1951 adaptation of Alan Paton’s best seller, “Cry, the Beloved Country,” an unusually forward-thinking exposé of the horrors of South African apartheid. Poitier returned to that theme 24 years later with “The Wilby Conspiracy,” a chase thriller in which he plays a revolutionary on the run from the authorities with a sympathetic white buddy (played by Michael Caine). Though essentially an action picture, the movie does a fine job of making injustice come alive. Poitier and Caine would later team up again for the 1997 TV movie “Mandela and de Klerk,” dramatizing apartheid’s last days. Poitier made some baffling professional choices during the ’80s and ’90s, when he rarely acted, and directed more than his share of duds. But it’s hard to fault him for joining Robert Redford, Dan Aykroyd, David Strathairn and River Phoenix for the ensemble adventure-comedy “Sneakers.” As a former C.I.A. agent aiding a team of well-meaning super-hackers, Poitier makes good use of his iconic screen presence, representing one of the last sparks of ’60s idealism in an increasingly synthetic age. One of Poitier’s last screen performances was in this 1999 TV movie, in which he plays an intensely private, self-sufficient, elderly Georgian whose mental competency is questioned when he refuses to sell his land. Noah Dearborn is the kind of character Poitier played throughout his career — skilled, stubborn and deeply decent — but it says something about how the culture changed during his lifetime that his race is no longer the defining element in his story. That’s a direct consequence of how Poitier spent his career defying stereotypes and fighting to bring layered Black individuals to the screen."
11,The New York Times,nytimes,Here are 20 new TV shows or slightly lower-profile returning shows that look interesting this winter. Try to fit in one or two.,https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3n8d486%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2A4GB8A_Mex4wiRk5vWrZyi1pvLgjbX0ZYH4frdms08YavhlooEOU_Bb8&h=AT3JW5m0QHExbCtqwqJYSPtMzoWHsgNn2PJG56b1lR_SxsY1yLt03lXHemgRUfWuoto5vlD1e0UHALzOJNn91tNQpTltdjILFacxXf_8sXImjB_mUykDUC8wZvBWf2WgEJM7N7DpriZpBwjbVwOx&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT3Jzt82PXvNEdnYJzyYqyNFj5Z2SqBH3GGRM_bXf7X28qNzpSUPLhVIbheJkXyn9ugrtlZjpl_vvsWq4OD4WeAP7zXsUgUolnTO8LZxmTRh1ogcwaAwwiaR0vzg_OjW_8O3U8piXLybGE4zxTg8lgSzPEwyBOJQ9pNzo7fsrcpyBslq,17h,"The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City has a long history of “period rooms” that use art, architecture and furnishings to convey a sense of bygone eras. The museum renovated this tradition in ways it could not have foreseen when it enlisted the production designer Hannah Beachler — who took home an Oscar for “Black Panther” — as lead curator of an installation celebrating the Black utopian community that was destroyed in 1857 to make way for Central Park. The enclave known as Seneca Village was established in 1825 and eventually grew to about 200 people. It was a shining example of African American self-reliance and community building when the press slandered it as a “nigger village” and a “shantytown” to justify sweeping it away. At a time when deepening segregation was the order of the day, the settlement had embraced racially integrated church worship and the forward-looking belief that white people and African Americans could abide together in mutual respect. The community’s fate was sealed when the gods of real estate coalesced around a blueprint that would whiten the city and take it upscale. Perhaps as many as 1,600 people were displaced to build the park, but the racialized argument that was brought to bear against African Americans stands out as a precursor of 20th-century “urban renewal” campaigns. The Met installation, entitled “Before Yesterday We Could Fly: An Afrofuturist Period Room,” embraces a cosmology of the African diaspora that sees past, present and future as coexisting in the same instance. The intricately decorated dwelling it depicts opens the door to an alternative universe where Seneca Village still flourishes and its people still lovingly tend their homes, gardens and churches. The hypothetical homestead on display in “Before Yesterday We Could Fly” is richly fitted out with art, furnishings, ceramics and household objects that reinforce the Afrofuturist theme. Kitchen crockery reflects the likenesses of people across time — from Harriet Tubman, to Beyoncé, to Stacey Abrams. In the living room, a five-sided television shows a brief black-and-white film directed by Jenn Nkiru. The film carries the viewer into the 19th century, contesting the idea that past, present and future can be divided into nonoverlapping periods. The most striking piece on display is an adaptation of a 19th-century corset dress, by the Haitian-born artist Fabiola Jean-Louis. Decorated in gold, Swarovski crystals, lapis lazuli, labradorite and brass, this stunning garment is posed in a seated position, as though to depict the woman of the house receiving visitors. This illusion of delicacy shatters when the museumgoer notices that the sleeves of the dress are reminiscent of chain mail armor and that the dress is dedicated to the vengeful deity who is said to have inspired the Haitian Revolution. That body armor metaphor is appropriate to the crucible in which Black New Yorkers lived when Seneca Village was founded in 1825. In preparation for the end of slavery, New York had done its best to incapacitate African Americans politically and economically. Black men had been largely driven from the skill trades and forced into subsistence jobs as laborers. The state then tried to obliterate Black voting rights by making ballot access for Black men contingent upon ownership of property valued at $250 “over and above all debts and encumbrances.” Black citizens were also under assault in the streets of Lower Manhattan, where proslavery mobs burned African American churches and threatened the lives of abolitionists. Not long after the state ended slavery in 1827, a syndicate of judges, lawyers and policemen convened a “kidnapping club” that placed both free African Americans and fugitives at risk of being snatched off the streets and trafficked into the slave states. Seneca Village had the virtue of being located several miles outside the hostile city center, on the western edge of what is now Central Park, between 83rd and 89th Streets. In addition to allowing Black property owners to vote, the settlement placed citizens of color at a welcome distance from Lower Manhattan. The new settlement also provided an ideal setting for fugitives from slavery to pause and refresh themselves while moving north on the Underground Railroad. Among the escapees who passed through the city during the Seneca Village period was the strikingly handsome Frederick Douglass, a fugitive from Baltimore who was soon to become one of the greatest orators of his day. One of the first buyers, the biblically named Epiphany Davis, underscored the settlement’s relationship to the antislavery struggle when he bequeathed his daughter a framed print of a slave ship as “a reminder that no matter how comfortable life could be for hardworking Black Americans, the evils of slavery were never to be forgotten.” The Seneca Village story is often recounted through the lens of tragedy and woe, but the historian Sara Cedar Miller relates a more nuanced tale in her forthcoming book, “Before Central Park.” In this telling, land ownership in the village is cast as an engine of empowerment, and even enrichment for African Americans who exploited the real estate wave and cashed out at the right moment. Early buyers typically purchased between one and three lots for an average of $40 each. This would have required prudence and diligent saving by manual laborers, gardeners and porters who earned only about $69 a year. Those who sold out during the real estate boom of the mid-1830s probably earned more money than they had in all of their working lives. While these sellers turned a tidy profit, a new cohort of African Americans arrived on the scene looking for safety, financial assets and, of course, the right to vote. A number of families that owned property in Seneca Village were members of an African American elite that lived, attended church and ran businesses downtown. These families purchased lots in the village partly in support of Black self-determination — but they also viewed real estate as an investment that would appreciate over time. Ms. Miller writes that the “Black elites held on to their land or passed it to their heirs until it was bought by the city for Central Park.” The African American businesswoman and abolitionist Elizabeth Gloucester stands out in this story. It has long been clear that she had amassed considerable wealth by the end of her life. “Before Central Park” makes a strong case that Ms. Gloucester’s renowned real estate empire began with the Seneca Village lot that she purchased in 1849 for $100 — and for which the city awarded her $460 in 1856 when it purchased the plot to build the park. “Without missing a beat,” Ms. Miller writes, “she used her award to buy a lot near Central Park between Madison and Fifth Avenues, 98th to 99th Streets, knowing full well that the property would only increase in value because of its proximity to the park.” She built her family wealth by acquiring more than 15 boarding homes and was thought to be one of the wealthiest Black women in the country. Like others in the Black elite, the philanthropically inclined Gloucesters used their money to influence causes, including abolition. The fire-breathing abolitionist John Brown stayed at the Gloucester home in Brooklyn Heights on his way to the failed attack on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Va., that would set him on the path to the gallows. The fearsome and beautiful war dress displayed in “Before Yesterday Could We Fly” would have been perfectly appropriate for Ms. Gloucester, with whom Brown was most impressed. He told her, “I wish you were a man, for I’d like to have you invade the South with my little band.” Not long before the raid, Brown met with Douglass, who passed a letter from Ms. Gloucester and a contribution of $25. The salutation read: “With best wishes for your Welfare and prosperity & the good of your cause. I subscribe myself your sincere friend.” Seneca Village property owners who lived elsewhere were differently situated on an emotional level than residents who had spent most or all of their lives worshiping, raising children and burying their dead in their beloved village. Assets and voting rights were of course important, but for families that had experienced the nightmare of slavery, the gift of a home where the family could be together was perhaps the most beloved possession of all. As Ms. Miller writes, “First generation Seneca Villagers were old enough to have grown up in a white household, and for some of them, it was the first time their family enjoyed the most basic experience that white Americans took for granted.” These men and women must have felt an incalculable sense of loss when they packed their belongings and departed their homes for the final time. The sense of dislocation was made all the more traumatic by the challenge of finding a new safe haven in a hostile city where an enclave like the one they had left behind was no longer possible. The Seneca Village story was largely lost to civic memory until 1992, when Roy Rosenzweig and Elizabeth Blackmar resurrected it in their book, “The Park and the People: A History of Central Park.” The task of reconstructing the story of the village and its residents is just beginning.

A few years back, she said, she had heard a young, accomplished Black businesswoman mention that she never attended happy hours with colleagues unless her boss explicitly asked her to join. Years of feeling the rejection that many Black Brazilians experience in predominantly white settings had taught her to seek clear invitations, the woman explained. Ms. Trajano, who is white, felt a pang of sadness. Then an uncomfortable thought crossed her mind. “At my birthday parties, there aren’t any Black women,” Ms. Trajano remembered thinking. “That’s structural racism that, in my case, is not born out of rejection, but out of failing to seek them out.” That moment of introspection for Ms. Trajano, who had turned a small family business into a retail behemoth, helped plant the seeds for a bold corporate affirmative action initiative, which has drawn praise, outrage and plenty of soul searching in Brazil. For the past two years, the public company, called Magazine Luiza, or Magalu, has limited its executive trainee program for recent college graduates — a pipeline to well-paying, senior roles — to Black applicants. The announcement, in September 2020, generated a deluge of news coverage and commentary. Much of it was critical. The hashtag #MagaluRacista — which means racist Magalu — trended on Twitter for days. A lawmaker close to Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s conservative president, urged federal prosecutors to open an investigation into the company, arguing that the program violated constitutional protections. But Magazine Luiza called it a necessary and overdue step to diversify its senior ranks and to atone for the brutal legacy of racism in Brazil, where slavery was not abolished until 1888. Ms. Trajano emerged as the most visible and vocal defender of her company’s policy. “Beyond the economic and social aspects, slavery left a very strong emotional mark, which is a society of colonizers and the colonized,” Ms. Trajano, 70, said. “Many people have never felt that this is their country.” Ms. Trajano has made waves far beyond corporate spheres by speaking bluntly about issues like race, inequality, domestic violence and the failings of the political system. Parties across the political spectrum have begged her to run for office — seeing in her a rare blend of pragmatism, charisma and smarts. “In a world where billionaires burn their fortunes on space adventures and yachts, Luiza is dedicated to a different kind of odyssey,” former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva wrote last September in Time magazine, which selected Ms. Trajano as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. “She has taken on the challenge of building a commercial giant while constructing a better Brazil.” Ms. Trajano was born an only child in Franca, a midsize city in the highlands of São Paulo state, where an aunt who shares her name opened a small gift store in 1957. As the business was expanding into a small cluster of retail shops, Ms. Trajano took a job as a salesperson at one of the stores as a teenager. The experience made her passionate about customer service and workplace culture. “When I was 17 or 18 I came up with small revolutions to make more of an investment in employees,” she said. “I began bringing in a psychologist to the store.” Ever since then, she said has been fascinated by the factors that make employees motivated and dedicated — and those that did the opposite. She took the helm of the business in 1991 and oversaw a huge nationwide expansion driven by the corporate mantra: “Make available to many what has been a privilege for a few.” As Magazine Luiza — which sells a bit of everything, including household goods, electronics, clothing and beauty products — grew into a behemoth with 1,400 stores, Ms. Trajano said she worked hard to build a culture in which workers were committed to the brand’s success.  On Monday mornings, employees at all Magazine Luiza sites gather in the morning to sing the national anthem, replicating a school tradition that Ms. Trajano cherished as a child. “You need rituals to maintain a strong culture,” Ms. Trajano said during an interview in her glass-encased office in the company’s headquarters in São Paulo. As retail sales started to shift online, Ms. Trajano invested heavily in creating a digital marketplace and a distribution system as she groomed her son Frederico Trajano to take over day-to-day management of the business in 2016 as chief executive. She remains president of the board and its most visible figure. Mr. Trajano, 45, said he learned from his mother to be a risk taker and to trust his intuition. “She likes to say, ‘play in the band,’ don’t just watch it march on,” he said. “That means learning to become the protagonist of my own story.” Ms. Trajano credited her son with coming up with the Blacks-only trainee program in 2020, but noted that it followed years of her pointing out that trainee classes were overwhelmingly white. The program has drawn neither lawsuits nor any government action. Ana Paula Pessoa, a Brazilian business executive who served as the chief financial officer of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, said the controversy sparked by the program led to uncomfortable conversations among her peers. “Every single company talked about it and everyone had an opinion on it,” she said. “Opening this discussion is essential because in Brazil we tend to throw things under the table and keep these huge elephants in the room that no one talks about.” The company doubled down on the initiative by releasing a 23-minute documentary about the selection process that feels more reality show than corporate promotion. It features applicants talking about the barriers they faced in getting their careers off the ground and shows some breaking down in tears when they learn they were accepted into the program. Raíssa Aryadne de Andrade Lima, 31, a sustainability analyst from the state of Alagoas who was admitted to the inaugural trainee class for Black professionals, said the job was transformational for her personally and professionally. “The best thing about the program was it opened my eyes to the number of opportunities that were possible for me,” she said. Ms. Trajano’s profile rose in 2019 after Forbes magazine first included her in its list of billionaires. She took to the label uncomfortably, Ms. Trajano said, noting that fortunes like hers can rise and fall based on stock performance. “I enjoy making business deals and when you do that you win and you lose sometimes,” she said. Ms. Trajano has said emphatically that she does not intend to run for office. But she has become increasingly active in shifting political debates through a group for women leaders she founded in 2013 with the aim of advancing gender parity in all spheres of power. Today, the group has more than 101,000 members. Group leaders are drafting long-term policy plans to address chronic problems in health care, education, housing and the labor market. They also advocate gender parity in electoral politics, which Ms. Trajano says would transform Brazil’s dysfunctional and polarized system.  In early 2021, as Brazil’s government was struggling to acquire Covid-19 vaccines and Mr. Bolsonaro sowed doubts about their efficacy, Ms. Trajano became a relentless champion for inoculations, mobilizing her network of women leaders to pressure the government to act quickly and to dispel misinformation about the shots. There has been fervent speculation online that Ms. Trajano could be a wild card in this year’s presidential elections, perhaps as a running mate of Mr. da Silva, the front-runner in the race. While she has categorically ruled out playing such a role, it’s clear Mr. Bolsonaro has come to see her as a threat to his re-election prospects. In November, he seemed to relish that the company’s stock price had fallen in recent months amid speculation of a political partnership between Mr. da Silva and Ms. Trajano, whom the president referred to as a “socialist.” Later that day, when Ms. Trajano was asked about the president’s remark, she said she didn’t find the label offensive. “I think social inequality must be confronted,” she said. “If that’s being a socialist, then I’m a socialist.”"

But she wants you to know that she is proud of it. At 25, she is finally a champion equipped to handle the pressure of the Olympics after nearly a decade at the top level of her sport. She is an example of why there should be no expiration date for skaters, she said, especially when they are still having fun. “I want it to be a known fact that skating doesn’t end at a certain age,” she said of her discipline, which is known to celebrate youth. On Friday, Bell became the oldest U.S. women’s national champion in 95 years, solidifying her spot on the U.S. team for the Beijing Olympics next month. At those Games, she will be the oldest American woman to compete in Olympic singles skating since 1928. U.S. Figure Skating named Bell, Karen Chen, 22, and Alysa Liu, 16, to the Olympic team on Saturday after considering their body of work over the past year or so. Chen, a 2018 Olympian, won the silver medal at nationals on Friday. Liu, who won the national championship at 13 in 2019, and again in 2020, withdrew from nationals on Friday after testing positive for the coronavirus.  With an Olympic berth finally in hand, and after a stressful and chaotic week, Bell savored her victory and exhaled long and hard. She and the other top American skaters have been on edge at nationals, and not only because Olympic berths are at stake. They have been practicing and competing in Nashville as the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus has swept around the world just weeks before the Beijing Games. At least six skaters tested positive this past week and withdrew from nationals, including Brandon Frazier, who skates with Alexa Knierim in pairs and won the national title with her last year. They are likely to be named to the Olympic team despite not competing this year. With two American pairs teams headed to Beijing, the other spot will most likely be filled either by Ashley Cain-Gribble and Timothy LeDuc, who won the pairs event on Saturday, or by Jessica Calalang and Brian Johnson, who finished in second place. The team will be announced on Sunday. In ice dance on Saturday, Madison Chock and Evan Bates won the national title, with Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue in second. Those two couples are nearly locks for the Olympic team, while the third Olympic berth will be up for grabs when the selections are announced on Sunday. Liu, who has been isolated in her hotel room since her positive test, appeared on the big screen at Bridgestone Arena on Saturday and waved to the cheering fans after being announced as an Olympic team selection. Later, she said that she was feeling good mentally and physically and that she had watched the women’s free skate on Friday with some friends joining her for a virtual viewing party. It was fun to be a spectator for a change, she said. Liu, who is from Richmond, Calif., wasn’t sure when she would be able to return to Colorado to resume her training, but the Olympic clock is ticking. Many competitors are planning to leave for China in less than three weeks, and they must follow strict rules, including testing negative for the virus, to be allowed into the country. In some cases, people who have contracted the virus have continued to test positive for weeks. “It depends on how quickly I can test negative again,” Liu said of her leaving for her training rink in Colorado. “I’m guessing I’m just going to stay here until I don’t have Covid anymore.” The positive tests at nationals shook the top female skaters as they prepared to compete, but Chen and Bell said they had taken only a moment to worry about it before snapping back into competition mode.  “I gave myself like 10 minutes to just full-on freak out,” Chen said.  Their idea of focusing solely on things they can control will come in handy in Beijing, where the Americans will be up against highly skilled competitors from Russia (which swept the medals at last year’s world championships), Japan and South Korea. Some of those competitors have demonstrated advanced elements that were barely even imaginable four years ago, including landing quadruple jumps not just once but several times during a single program. Those advanced elements equal more points — so many more points that the Americans probably won’t be able to keep up with them. Neither Bell nor Chen is able to land a quadruple jump or a triple axel, moves that have become almost necessary to win on the world stage. And neither skater, in her free skate on Friday, executed a triple-triple jump combination, a foundation for medal contenders at international events. While Liu was the first American woman to land a quad in international competition and was the first woman in the world to land a quad and a triple axel in the same program, she hasn’t seriously practiced a quad since March 2020, she said, and doesn’t plan to do one anytime soon. Chen, who is from Fremont, Calif., is not giving up hope that the Americans can place well at the Olympics, considering her fourth-place finish at last year’s world championships.  “I really went there just thinking, I’m going to skate my absolute best and perform the heck out of my program,” she said, adding, “So, you know, anything can happen.” Adam Rippon, an Olympic bronze medalist who coaches Bell, also believes that the Americans shouldn’t dwell on medals or placement. He has advised Bell to skate only for herself, which is exactly what brought him joy in the sport. “The thing that Mariah needs to focus on is that, at the end of the day, people don’t always remember the results, but they’ll remember the skates and they’ll remember the way that you made them feel,” he said. Bell, who is from Westminster, Colo., easily bought in. She has stuck around the sport for so long because she loves the way it makes her feel, thanks to her parents.  Once when she was very young, she recalled, her parents bought her a package of skating lessons, and she soon told them that she wanted to quit. Her parents shrugged and said, “That’s fine.” But without any prodding, she went back to the rink. Again and again. Her mother and father never pushed her into the sport, she said, and that nurtured her love for it. On Friday, that love for skating permeated Bell’s performance. During her elegant and ethereal free skate to K.D. Lang’s version of “Hallelujah,” she smiled and glowed, making her hardest elements seem simple. In her sparkly burgundy dress, she looked like a prima ballerina spinning and floating above the ice, landing six triple jumps softly, as if she were weightless. It was the moment she had worked toward for years — especially this past year. When her former fiancé broke off their engagement last year, it nearly crushed her, she said, but in the end it refocused her. No more distractions. With the Beijing Olympics in sight, she redoubled her efforts to reach her skating goals, vowing to use her life experience, both good and bad, both on and off the ice — the experience of an “ancient” skater, shall we say — to push her toward success. It worked. “For me, it’s sort of like my superpower,” she said."

It's also a portable workout that builds strength, speed, and protects our bodies as we age.",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3HSkjsJ%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1RRpDJd1_tnj8XL1_dviWCPrj9PHfrJ_ETChBX6UP3xzmMdgVtkvgrDlk&h=AT2Zpa_JfV6eQGooDdIjROPK2lI4O7-tTz23JF4PaN8qj7F1mnGPivwgh8whcLn8-EUvJ5OMtGa9_0Hpnu7KtOzjhys0m6LNptU8LEXAnu41hp6TMrOaluuoXDWVEGb1U5wYlg9wBad2st2yk40B&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT0mXVmBrDXu4GDEuBYrUBHFe1e2N3_jELQiBlxK6M6KKjeXxFaZ-tT-26PMlk3Gunk-FPlD4eYjNhMfbAJU1dOBUh3UJfWTf1d5rzYZtAMNQgwMhA7_YNCTx7zG-kP1PIsejzDyDhpzrscIedaUWgaKVWEydWEx4gBRmmZGoDhLLQR7,18h,"New York City’s new police commissioner has expressed severe dissatisfaction with the policies of the new Manhattan district attorney, sending an email to all officers late on Friday that suggests a potential rupture between City Hall and the prosecutor over their approaches to public safety. The email from Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said she was deeply troubled by policies outlined by Alvin Bragg, the district attorney, in a 10-page memo that Mr. Bragg sent to his staff on Monday. The memo instructed prosecutors to avoid seeking jail or prison time for all but the most serious crimes, and to cease charging a number of lower-level crimes. Commissioner Sewell, who, like Mr. Bragg, was just a week into her job, said in her email to about 36,000 members of the department that she had studied the policies and come away “very concerned about the implications to your safety as police officers, the safety of the public and justice for the victims.” The email, which was first reported by WNBC-TV, suggests a looming conflict not just between them, but also between the new district attorney and the commissioner’s boss, Mayor Eric Adams. The collision course between the mayor and the district attorney was sketched out during the Democratic primary in the spring of 2021. Mr. Adams made a crackdown on crime one of the main themes of his campaign; Mr. Bragg, following in the path carved by a handful of prosecutors in cities around the country, pledged to help reshape the legal system, to avoid disproportionate punishment for first-time offenders or those struggling with mental health issues or poverty. In a statement on Saturday, a spokesman for the district attorney’s office said: “We share Commissioner Sewell’s call for frank and productive discussions to reach common ground on our shared mission to deliver safety and justice for all and look forward to the opportunity to clear up some misunderstandings.” “For our office, safety is paramount,” the statement said. It added that contrary to the way that Commissioner Sewell and others had interpreted parts of the memo, the office intended to charge anyone who used guns to rob stores or who assaulted police officers with felonies. “All must be held accountable for their actions,” it said. To some degree, the emerging tensions between the commissioner and Mr. Bragg reflect a broader political argument between centrist Democrats across the nation looking to soothe voters worried about crime and a movement of progressive prosecutors that has pushed for more lenient policies to make the justice system more fair and less biased. Some of those tensions are likely to play out in Albany this year in a debate over whether to scale back changes in a state bail law that went into effect two years ago, and that provoked strong reactions almost immediately. There is always an ingrained tension between the police and prosecutors that often centers on what charges to bring and, at times, whether there is sufficient evidence to make an arrest. For the police, in some measure, the job ends with handcuffs, while prosecutors are left with proving a case beyond a reasonable doubt or finding some other resolution. But such arguments do not often became public at all, let alone so early in a new administration. Mr. Adams has been complimentary about Mr. Bragg when asked about him in recent interviews, calling him a “great prosecutor” and declining to criticize the memo. Asked about the commissioner’s email, the mayor’s office responded with a statement from Stefan Ringel, a senior adviser: “The mayor has deep respect for the district attorney and looks forward to working with him and the police commissioner to make sure the streets are safe, and to discussing any concerns directly.” A police spokesman said the email “speaks for itself.” Mr. Bragg and Mr. Adams, both Democrats, have significant histories in law enforcement, and both have pledged some measure of reform. Mr. Bragg, a former federal prosecutor, stood out in a competitive primary vowing to balance safety with justice. Mr. Adams, a former police captain, has spoken out against police brutality and, while serving, pushed for changes within the department. Mr. Bragg is the first Black person to lead the district attorney’s office, Mr. Adams is the second Black mayor in the city’s history, and Commissioner Sewell is the first woman and third Black person to lead the Police Department. In his memo, Mr. Bragg instructed his prosecutors that unless they were required by law to do otherwise, they should ask judges for jail or prison time only for those who had committed serious offenses, including murder, sexual assault and major economic crimes. Others, he has said, would be directed to programs better equipped to deal with the issues that had led them to commit the crimes. The new district attorney also instructed his prosecutors not to charge a number of misdemeanors. Many of the crimes on his list already were not being prosecuted by his predecessor, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. But Mr. Bragg directed his staff to avoid charging several misdemeanors which previously had been charged, including resisting arrest. “These policy changes not only will, in and of themselves, make us safer; they also will free up prosecutorial resources to focus on violent crime,” Mr. Bragg said in his memo. The directive on resisting arrest was among those that Commissioner Sewell expressed most concern about. She said that it would send a message to police officers and others that there was “an unwillingness to protect those who are carrying out their duties.” “I strongly believe that this policy injects debate into decisions that would otherwise be uncontroversial, will invite violence against police officers and will have deleterious effects on our relationship with the communities we protect,” she wrote. Mr. Bragg has also instructed his prosecutors not to seek jail time for gun possession without an accompanying charge. The commissioner strongly objected to that policy, saying that it “affords people the opportunity to continually possess guns without consequence,” and calling it the issue that most directly affected officers’ safety. Commissioner Sewell’s email, sent at about 8:30 p.m. on the Friday of Mr. Adams’s first week in office, capped a whirlwind day for the city’s top criminal justice officials. Earlier in the day, the new mayor announced a deputy mayor for public safety, Philip Banks III, only after Mr. Banks made the appointment public in an opinion piece in The Daily News. Mr. Banks had faced significant scrutiny given his history as a subject of a federal corruption investigation that resulted in prosecutors naming him as an unindicted co-conspirator. Also on Friday, Mr. Adams’s brother, Bernard Adams, was named as a deputy police commissioner. Bernard Adams retired as a sergeant for the New York Police Department in 2006, and he has more recently worked as an operations manager and parking administrator at Virginia Commonwealth University, according to his LinkedIn profile. It is unclear what Mayor Adams’s role in the commissioner’s memo might have been. Commissioner Sewell, an outsider to the N.Y.P.D. who had been the chief of detectives in the Nassau County Police Department, a far smaller agency, was his choice for police commissioner after a nationwide search, and she reports to him and to Mr. Banks. As mayor, Mr. Adams has the ability to dictate police policy and he has, throughout the campaign, maintained that he has every intention of using that power. Commissioner Sewell’s email dissected Mr. Bragg’s policies at length and took issue with a number of them. She expressed concern about his instruction that robberies of businesses be treated as misdemeanors if the offender does not create a genuine risk of physical harm, and with the downgrading of certain drug charges. She asked for clarification on several policies and said his policy of not prosecuting fare evasion — which Mr. Vance announced he would stop charging in most instances more than four years ago — was a potential issue. Mr. Bragg’s memo included an important caveat: He said that all such requests must adhere to the law. That will significantly dilute some of the most far-reaching effects of his new policies. New York law requires those who have been convicted of a felony in the past to be imprisoned if found guilty of a second such crime, and many of the worst offenses carry mandatory minimum sentences that Mr. Bragg’s prosecutors will be compelled to heed. Prosecutors around the country with policies similar to Mr. Bragg’s have faced vocal opposition, particularly from police unions, and in the days after the rollout of the new district attorney’s memo, several such unions objected strongly to his program. On Saturday morning, Pat Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association, said in a statement that the union supported the commissioner’s positions. And the often combative union leader added that he was looking forward to working with her and Mr. Bragg. But the letter from Commissioner Sewell suggested that Mr. Bragg would face significant headwinds as he tried to carry out the vision that he campaigned on. However, several of his peers in cities around the country — including Larry Krasner in Philadelphia and Kim Foxx in Chicago — cruised to re-election after facing similar opposition. In an interview on CNN on Friday morning, Mr. Bragg defended his policies. “This is what I was elected to do,” he said. The commissioner and Mr. Bragg were in contact this week, and Mr. Bragg hopes to meet soon, his spokesman said. Commissioner Sewell said in her email that she hoped “to try and reach more common ground.”"

None of the infected people required hospitalization, medical evacuation or monoclonal antibody treatment, said Dawn Grimes, the spokeswoman at the base hospital, which serves both the community and the detention operation holding 39 wartime prisoners. She did not comment on whether any of the prisoners or roughly 1,500 military members and civilian employees who staff the operation had tested positive. Nearly all of the 69 people who tested positive for the virus had been fully vaccinated, Ms. Grimes said. A few were partly vaccinated. One of the 69 included a 10-year-old child who is either fully or half vaccinated, said a base spokeswoman, Nikki L. Maxwell, on Saturday. No other details were available. On Tuesday, the base commander, Capt. Samuel White, reinstated an indoor mask mandate for all residents in response to what he called “this uptick in cases.” That day, Ms. Grimes reported that 17 people on the base had tested positive since Dec. 1, all but one of them fully vaccinated. Until this week, only the estimated 900 unvaccinated people on the base had been required to wear masks indoors, making for crowds of unmasked patrons in the base’s Irish pub and at the gym. Ms. Grimes said Friday that, in response to the surge, the base was requiring vaccinated visitors and returning residents to be tested on arrival, isolate for at least three days, and then be tested again before they can rejoin the community. Unvaccinated people have been consistently required to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival. She added that public health workers had at times this week carried out about 250 tests in a single day, and that the small community hospital had sufficient testing capacity to do more if needed. “Our Covid-19 hotline team continues to field calls around the clock to answer Covid-19-related questions and to provide screening for individuals who are experiencing symptoms,” she said. The base also introduced round-the-clock curbside testing at the hospital, which sends its most serious or complex cases to the United States for military medical care. The detainees are the exception: The Pentagon sends specialists, including neurosurgeons with specialized equipment, to treat the prisoners, many of whom are approaching their third decade in U.S. detention. Cases rose after a Navy ship from Jacksonville, Fla., the U.S.S. Milwaukee, stayed at the base pier from Christmas through New Year’s with about one-fourth of its 105-member crew infected. Most had mild or asymptomatic cases. Guantánamo has reported an 85 percent vaccination rate, meaning roughly 900 base residents declined or were ineligible for vaccines. Some of them are the young children of sailors and Navy contractors who live in suburban-style housing on the base."

On Friday afternoon, the Department of Environmental Protection received a report of a roof collapse and a trapped miner at Laurel Aggregates’ Lake Lynn Quarry in Springhill Township, on the border of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, according to the statement. A rescue team from the department’s Bureau of Mine Safety responded to the accident. Laurel Aggregates crews and the rescue team worked for hours to remove loose rock to reach the equipment and “move it under a solid, supported area of the roof to ultimately extricate the individual,” according to the statement. During the rescue, the miner was not responsive, and crews were unable to assess the person’s condition. At 11:03 p.m., the individual was pulled out from the mine by the Smithfield Volunteer Fire Department and the mine rescue team. The miner was pronounced dead at the scene. The collapse will be investigated by the department and the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, which describes the material mined at the quarry as “crushed broken limestone.” “D.E.P. will issue a preliminary action report with general findings and a final report with its full determination of the cause and potential corrective measures required of the mine operator to ensure that this type of situation does not happen again,” the agency said. According to the Department of Environmental Protection, although mining in Pennsylvania peaked in the early 20th century, there are still more than 40 active underground coal mines in the state. There are at least 5,000 abandoned underground mines across the state. During coal mining’s peak in the United States, thousands of miners died in fatal accidents every year, according to data from the Mine Safety and Health Administration, a division of the U.S. Department of Labor. Coal mining accidents have decreased exponentially, with only five coal mining deaths in 2020. The last time a mine’s roof collapsed in Pennsylvania was last May, when a mine operator “exceeded the maximum cut depth” in the mine, causing the roof to fall. The operator died in the accident."

The man, Yao Pan Ma, was pushing a grocery cart full of bottles and cans that he had collected on April 23 when he was suddenly approached from behind and attacked in East Harlem. He fell onto the sidewalk, was kicked in the head and stomped on several times, the police said. Mr. Ma, 61, was placed on a ventilator and remained hospitalized since the assault occurred near 125th Street and Third Avenue. He had severe head injuries and there was bleeding in his brain, officials said. The man arrested in the attack, Jarrod Powell, 49, was charged with attempted murder and two counts of assault as a hate crime at the time. The police said on Saturday that upgraded murder charges were expected to be filed. Mr. Ma’s death on Dec. 31 came at the end of a year in which similar unprovoked attacks on Asian people prompted fear and led to protests in New York and across the country. The New York Police Department received 128 reports of anti-Asian hate crimes through the end of November. That represented a sharp rise from the 28 that were recorded through that period in 2020. Community groups have said that anti-Asian attacks have long been underreported because of language barriers and distrust of the police. Mr. Powell was arrested days after the attack. The police found him at a shelter he had lived in for about 10 months, according to court documents. A lawyer for Mr. Powell could not immediately be reached on Saturday. Mr. Powell denied “having problems with Asians” in interviews with officers, according to court records. He said that he had been robbed a day before the attack by two men, one Korean and one Japanese, but did not call 911 or offer physical descriptions besides their ethnicities, the documents said. Mr. Powell claimed that Mr. Ma was one of the men, according to the filings. He said he saw him on the street the next day, and that he had been verbally provoked. When Mr. Ma fell to the ground, Mr. Powell said he thought, “I am not going to let you up” and began kicking him, the filings say. His next court appearance is scheduled for Feb. 10. In New York, to charge attacks like the one against Mr. Ma as hate crimes, prosecutors must show that the victims were targeted because of their race. The police said that surveillance camera footage suggested that Mr. Ma and his attacker had not interacted before the assault, leading them to believe he may have been targeted because of his race. Mr. Ma’s wife, Baozhen Chen, could not be reached on Saturday for comment. In the spring, she spoke to several local news outlets and said she feared that her husband would “not make it” after the attack. The pair moved to New York City around 2019 from China’s Guangdong Province, leaving their two adult children behind. Mr. Ma had worked as a dessert chef in China, she told The Daily News, but lost his job at a restaurant in New York during the pandemic. He was ineligible for unemployment benefits, and began to collect cans on the street starting in September 2020, she said. Ms. Chen, a home health care aide, said Mr. Ma regularly called her when he arrived at home, letting her know that he had made it back safely. She worried after he failed to call on the April night when she later learned that he had been attacked. “He was just trying to help out the family,” Ms. Chen told The News. “He had no bad intentions. He wouldn’t cause trouble with other people in his neighborhood.”"

The backstage comedy-drama, about the rehearsal process for an anti-lynching play, tackles racism in the theater industry, and that quote sums up what Black Americans have historically experienced — a consistent outcry to be heard by the dominant society that refuses to listen. In “Trouble in Mind,” I play Wiletta Mayer, a middle-aged actress who dreams of doing something “real grand … in the theater.” This is Wiletta’s first time as the lead in a play, not a musical. Surprisingly, this role in a play is a first for me as well, even though I have been performing in Broadway musicals for over 30 years. And it’s the perfect role, because of many of my career experiences: as an actress onstage, my length of time in this business, not having the opportunity to be considered a serious dramatic actress. I draw on all of them to step into Wiletta’s shoes. Now I go to the American Airlines Theater six times a week to portray a character I first came to know in college. I get to feel her life experiences as my own. I get to convey the things so many Black actors have expressed, but, as Wiletta says, “You don’t want to hear.” I first read “Trouble in Mind” — along with a wide range of works by Black American playwrights — as a student at Morgan State University in Maryland, one of our nation’s historically Black colleges and universities. Writers who used their plays as art and activism — Childress, Amiri Baraka, Nikki Giovanni, Gwendolyn Brooks and so many others — inspired me to become a performing artist. Studying their works ignited my ambition to delve as deep as a person can into the values that make an artist and activist. I wanted to feel their kind of power, their eloquence, and their courage. This courage, this fire that led Childress to produce such timeless words. In fact her play is being performed word-for-word in its original form. Childress was born in Charleston, S.C., in 1916, and died in Queens in 1994. She wrote and produced plays for four decades. She put up “Trouble” Off Broadway in 1955, four years before Lorraine Hansberry made history by debuting “A Raisin in the Sun” on Broadway, and was the first playwright I ever read to show authentic conversations between Black Americans, things that are said about whites when whites aren’t around. She exposed a Black cultural way of speaking that we call code switching, which the Urban dictionary defines as customizing “style of speech to the audience or group being addressed.” Childress cleverly demonstrates this in “Trouble in Mind.” She gives the audience a peek into what we, as Black actors, must do to accommodate white audiences. In the beginning of the play, Wiletta tells John, a young actor, how to act around white people, explaining there are certain things you must do: The stereotypes have changed over the years — now there’s the hyper-masculinity of Black men; the strong Black woman who doesn’t seem to have a need for vulnerability or tenderness; Black children whose innocence has been removed — but the same rules still apply. “Trouble” was optioned for Broadway, but never opened there because Childress would not tone down the dialogue for the show’s white producers. The white director in the play, Al Manners, tells Wiletta, “The American public is not ready to see you the way you want to be seen because, one, they don’t believe it, two, they don’t want to believe it, and three, they’re convinced they’re superior.” I have also had white male directors debate with me about what a Black woman would say, feel, even how she would dress. Childress was unapologetic about her intentions, even if it meant her work wouldn’t make it to Broadway in her lifetime. I have debated this with other artists, wondering whether she was even more brave than brilliant. But we agree that she was a truth teller, a soothsayer. As a student and young actor, I was astonished that the canon of Black American writers and artists that so richly shaped my artistic life were mostly unknown and so poorly understood. The play’s director, Charles Randolph-Wright, the first Black director with whom I have worked as a leading actor on Broadway, shepherded this project for 15 years. He also read the play in college and fell in love with Childress’s unapologetic writing. He is the champion of “Trouble in Mind.” Charles, who studied at Duke University and with the Royal Shakespeare Company in London, and danced with Alvin Ailey in New York, was told many times that he could not make this happen. It is as if, with her words in the play, Childress wrote directly to Charles six decades ago, “I’m sick of people signifyin’ we got no sense.” Charles wants to give her the voice she should have had before he and I were born. In our many conversations, I am invigorated in speaking to him about Black representation in the entertainment industry. Working with a director who I feel lives in my head is thrilling. My private thoughts that I’m sometimes too shy to share, Charles boldly speaks them before I can even get them out. Much like Childress, Charles is committed to telling the truth in his work and in having multidimensional portrayals of Black people, not just the broad strokes we see. And quite frankly, we’re both tired of seeing these examples. In my own career, I’ve taken jobs I didn’t want to do, but I had to play these parts because I needed a job. I get to work with a dedicated, resilient Black director, and a fearless, committed cast. Childress wanted to speak for the have-nots, the invisibles, and to share her eloquence with the Broadway community and universities across the world. She used her play about Black actors to explore the values of America. But some people weren’t ready, and so many people never got to hear her words. Now I proudly stand on her shoulders, opening my soul to her and teaching my daughters and other lovers of truth about her brilliance. “Some live by what they call great truths,” Wiletta says in the play. “I’ve always wanted to do somethin’ real grand … in the theater … to stand forth at my best … to stand up here and do anything I want …” And that’s exactly what Alice Childress did."
19,The New York Times,nytimes,"The Emmy-winning HBO teen drama “Euphoria,” starring Zendaya, comes back for a second season on Sunday. But it’s been a few years since Season 1 ended. Here's where things left off.https://nyti.ms/3F9ArEr",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3q3Dqtz%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2nSe8tfO2aM_XbbTwjoR3bmVja_fm7ZTGIoJPU-6baTrwqeAa1VU7ZmRo&h=AT3-iCTmXaqkVA3Y9a0pCFOrAJEyrDHKzVdjQlnLs5_9AuQFyN6JUOl0a1Q5lnY4VJvmcl2U-ekbRKw2Fv0X96aEV3940cdDIF-2h9J5ShaIW9g3SwfSnfHelo__VHNvOCvIVfxU_xuOhOfcggPu&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT3QoLmyP3QGFHi36aI-zpjsvNwVGj9n91MO7-AFz1JgB5BLM0oEAFgpi6cXdEKPW1xx7omOsQQ3WiRvVbcW3q7uhr1txXLe68NSrgOC_yjaupMe-0WFRN5QNTxUYYg5HadtlsrphYBFJQzovfmmhsJgotIGfMhFswE4Zlo16c_xqL51,19h,"Following reports that the actor Alec Baldwin’s cellphone had not yet been turned over to officials investigating the fatal shooting on the “Rust” film set — weeks after a search warrant was granted — Mr. Baldwin said on Saturday that any suggestion that he was not complying with law enforcement was a “lie.” The police in Santa Fe, N.M., obtained a search warrant more than three weeks ago granting it access to information on Mr. Baldwin’s phone related to the October shooting, during which a gun that Mr. Baldwin was rehearsing with fired a live round, killing the movie’s cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, and wounding its director, Joel Souza. The sheriff’s office and district attorney of Santa Fe County investigating how a live round got into the gun told media outlets this week that the authorities did not yet have Mr. Baldwin’s phone, prompting the actor to respond in a video posted to his Instagram page. Filming himself from the driver’s seat of a parked car, Mr. Baldwin said the process for recovering information from his phone “takes time” and involved the authorities in New Mexico coordinating with the authorities where he lives. “Someone from another state can’t come to you and say, ‘Give me your phone,’” Mr. Baldwin said in the video, adding: “They have to specify what exactly they want. They can’t just go through your phone and take, you know, your photos or your love letters to your wife or what have you.” He added, in reference to the process and the warrant, “We are 1,000 percent going to comply with all that.” According to an affidavit filed in the application for the search warrant, granted by a judge in New Mexico on Dec. 16, Detective Alexandria Hancock asked Mr. Baldwin and his lawyer on the day of the fatal shooting to hand over his phone but was told to obtain a warrant. That month, a lawyer for Mr. Baldwin, Aaron Dyer, said they “proactively requested that the authorities obtain a warrant so that we could take steps to protect Mr. Baldwin’s family and personal information that is clearly unrelated to the investigation.” When the search warrant for Mr. Baldwin’s phone was granted, officials in Santa Fe requested help from the sheriff’s office in Suffolk County in New York, where Mr. Baldwin has a home. Paul Spinella, a spokesman for the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office, said the request had been forwarded to the county’s district attorney’s office to “work out the differences in laws” between the two states. Juan Rios, a spokesman for the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office, said on Friday that once the authorities received the results of the search warrant, they would be considered public record. In a television interview last month, Mr. Baldwin fiercely insisted that he was not to blame in the fatal shooting of Ms. Hutchins, 42, and said that he did not pull the trigger when he was practicing with the old-fashioned Colt revolver on the set of “Rust.” He added that he did not cock the hammer of the gun, but pulled it back as far as he could and let it go in an action that might have set it off. For more than two months, detectives have been working to figure out how live bullets, which are not typically allowed, ended up on the film set and whether they could have come from the supplier of blanks and dummy rounds for the production. “The best way — the only way — we can honor the death of Halyna Hutchins is to find out the truth,” Mr. Baldwin said in the Instagram video."

The answer is: This kind of behavior infuriates people opposed to progress for trans and nonbinary individuals. What is passing as normal? In late December an Oakland, Calif., engineering manager named Amy Schneider became the winningest woman in “Jeopardy!” history — and then she kept on winning. She just became the first woman in the history of the game show to surpass $1 million in winnings during regular-season play. Ms. Schneider tweeted in December that she felt “proud, dazed, happy, numb, all those things.” Midway through her winning streak, Ms. Schneider began to talk publicly about her pride in another aspect of her identity. “I am a trans woman, and I’m proud of that fact,” she posted on Twitter, “but I’m a lot of other things too!” She asked her new followers to consider a holiday donation to charities that help trans folks in need, including the Trans Lifeline and the Transgender Law Center. Unfortunately — but unsurprisingly — Ms. Schneider’s trans pride awoke a crew of conservative pundits who worked to chip away at her joy, insisting she hadn’t achieved the accomplishment of “most consecutive victories by a woman.” Their ugly quotes are hardly worth repeating, but the sum of it was the complaint that Ms. Schneider’s remarkable achievements weren’t a win for women. That, of course, is because they insist she is not a woman at all. Like all dust-ups over trans success stories, this bloviating over a trans woman winning one of America’s longest-running game shows is not about Ms. Schneider herself or the records she has set. It’s not even, really, about women’s rights or biology. It’s about how terrifying some Americans find any shift toward inclusivity and tolerance. It’s about their unwillingness to accept the reality that it’s actually not very radical to be trans anymore. What, after all, is more mainstream than “Jeopardy!”? To keep trans people on the margins of society, living in some sort of gender netherworld, is to assert that trans Americans aren’t America. It is OK only if gender variance stays in the realms of performance and satire, a laugh line on a sitcom, someone acting like a clown. Remember that time Rudy Giuliani appeared in drag as “Rudia” at a charity dinner? All in good fun! (Yes, I am aware that drag is actually an art form that has provided an outlet and a lifeline for many, many L.G.B.T. people.) But heaven forbid trans people try to be something other than a laugh line. Was it actually Rachel Levine’s long history as a public health advocate that Rand Paul found so objectionable when he turned contentious, grilling her during her Senate confirmation hearings for assistant secretary of health? Sure, the occasion of Admiral Levine’s candidacy gave Senator Paul an opportunity to hold forth on what he saw as the evils lurking behind providing gender-confirming medical care to trans teenagers. But I suspect Admiral Levine’s greater sin was that she had the temerity to exist without shame in the first place. Similarly, it probably wasn’t the patriotism of trans service members or their combat readiness that Donald Trump had in mind when he issued his directive to deny trans people the ability to serve in the military. More likely, it was the very idea that these heroes had the gall to be both valorous and visible. It is worth admitting that normality as a goal, for anyone, is dubious at best. I know plenty of trans and nonbinary people whose very identity is tied up in the idea of transgression, of rejection of the chains that the idea of a gender binary demands. Allowing a multitude of ways to exist in the world seems like a very good way of setting people free. My dear friend Kate Bornstein titled her 1994 memoir “Gender Outlaw.” In the years since then, she and I have had many loving disagreements about gender and whether to be trans demands that we become “outlaws.” I tell her, I’m an outlaw, but not because I’m trans. I’m an outlaw because I seek knowledge in a culture that elevates ignorance; I’m an outlaw because I’m a Deadhead in a culture that celebrates Justin Bieber. Being trans is essential to who I am, but it doesn’t make me an outlaw. For me, being trans, in the end, is kind of boring. I am surely not normal — whatever that means — but my transness has little to do with my being a kind of outlier. As Ms. Schneider tweeted: “The fact is, I don’t actually think about being trans all that often …. I wanted to represent that part of my identity accurately; as important, but also relatively minor.” Normal, as the saying goes, is just a setting on the dryer. It may be that what many social conservatives fear most of all is that making space for trans people in ordinary American life means that the very definition of what it means to be mainstream is changing. There is nothing inherently salutary about fitting in. But surely any list of accomplished Americans could include people such as my friend Lana Moore, a retired fire captain in Columbus, Ohio; Dr. Christine McGinn, who served as a flight surgeon for two space shuttle missions; my colleague Rebecca Oppenheimer, a professor of astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History and Columbia University; and Tona Brown, an internationally acclaimed violinist and mezzo-soprano. All of them are trans, but they’re not heroes because of what they are. They’re heroes because of what they have done. We’re almost out of time, so here’s the topic for Final Jeopardy: Famous Mythical Quotes.

The injury took place as the 10th-grade student, Teddy Balkind, fell on the rink during a game between two private schools in Fairfield County. After Mr. Balkind fell, another player was unable to slow down and ran into him. Officials said Mr. Balkind’s neck was cut by the other player’s skate. The game was immediately stopped and staff members called 911, the police said. Mr. Balkind was treated at the scene before being taken to a hospital but he did not survive surgery, school officials said. His death spurred waves of shock and grief throughout southwest Connecticut. The two schools — St. Luke’s School in New Canaan and Brunswick School in Greenwich — mourned what officials called an “unimaginable tragedy.” Local and professional hockey players offered their condolences and shared tributes to Mr. Balkind. “Our community is mourning,” Mark Davis, the head of school at St. Luke’s, where Mr. Balkind was a student, said in a statement. “We lost a precious young man in a tragic accident. Both St. Luke’s School and Brunswick School are in shock as we work to support our students and families. St. Luke’s singular focus at this moment is to care for our devastated community.” His hockey program wrote on Twitter that “no words are adequate for the grief we are all feeling.” The match started around 5 p.m. and gameplay had been “entirely normal and unremarkable” before the accident took place, officials at the Brunswick School said in a letter to alumni. Mr. Balkind was a longtime ice hockey player, often wearing No. 5 on his jersey and skating for the New Canaan Winter Club. He had attended St. Luke’s, a private institution with grades 5 through 12, since middle school, where he was once recognized for crafting the school’s “artwork of the week.” Photos on his public Instagram page told a story of a nature- and sports-loving teenager. Videos showed him mountain biking and leaping over branches on trails in Connecticut and Pennsylvania. One image showed him celebrating a state championship with his hockey team. The most recent photo, posted on Oct. 5, showed him biking through a mountain park. Under it, nearly 1,000 people left comments filled with hearts and messages of “RIP” and “rest easy buddy.” Mr. Balkind’s family could not be reached for comment on Saturday. School officials said in statements that his father had been in the audience at the game and traveled to the hospital with him. Clark Jones, the director of hockey at the New Canaan Winter Club, called Mr. Balkind a positive presence on the team and said the community was deeply struggling with the loss. “We lost a tremendous young man,” Mr. Jones wrote on Twitter on Friday. “Always smiling, a great teammate, and a passionate hockey player.” St. Luke’s was closed on Friday because of snow but school officials told students the building would be open to offer community members space to process the death. Officials at the Brunswick School, the all-boys private school and the host of Thursday’s game, said in messages to students that counseling and support services would be in place for the hockey players. After Mr. Balkind’s death was confirmed in local news reports, families and community members in New Canaan leaned hockey sticks and other sports equipment alongside their door frames and on their porches in his memory. The news also reached the National Hockey League. Cam Atkinson, a right winger on the Philadelphia Flyers, shared a photo of him participating in the remembrance on social media, writing that he was “heartbroken” for the family. “A horrible tragedy playing the game we all love,” he said. The league and other teams, including the New York Rangers, also posted messages to Mr. Balkind’s family. “While it’s hard to put into words the impact of such a loss, know that our thoughts, prayers and hearts are with you,” the Rangers wrote on Twitter."

On Saturday, the observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope, completed a final, crucial step around 10:30 a.m. by unfolding the last section of its golden, hexagonal mirrors. Nearly three hours later, engineers sent commands to latch those mirrors into place, a step that amounted to it becoming fully deployed, according to NASA. It was the most recent of a series of delicate maneuvers with what the space agency called 344 “single points of failure” while speeding far away in space. Now the telescope is almost ready for business, although more tense moments are still in its future. “I’m emotional about it,” Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA’s science chief, said of all the telescope’s mirrors finally clicking into place. “What an amazing milestone — we see that beautiful pattern out there in the sky now almost complete.” The James Webb Space Telescope, named after a former NASA administrator who oversaw the formative years of the Apollo program, is 25 years and $10 billion in the making. It is three times the size of the Hubble Space Telescope and designed to see further into the past than its celebrated predecessor in order to study the first stars and galaxies to turn on in the dawn of time. The launch on an Ariane rocket on the morning of Dec. 25 was flawless; so flawless that the engineers said it saved enough maneuvering fuel to extend the mission’s estimated 10-year lifetime, perhaps by as much as an additional 10 years, said Mike Menzel, a mission systems engineer at NASA Goddard. But the telescope must complete a monthlong journey to a spot a million miles up, far beyond the moon’s orbit, called L2, where gravitational fields of the Earth and sun commingle to produce the conditions for a stable orbit around the sun. With a primary mirror 21 feet across, the Webb was too big to fit in a rocket, and so the mirror was made in segments, 18 gold-plated hexagons folded together, that would have to pop into position once the telescope was in space. Another challenge was that the telescope’s instruments had to be sensitive to infrared or “heat radiation,” a form of electromagnetic radiation invisible to the human eye. Because of the expansion of the universe, the most distant and earliest galaxies are flying away from us so fast that visible light from those galaxies shifts into the longer infrared wavelengths. As a result, the Webb will view the universe in colors no human eye has ever seen. But in order to detect infrared radiation from distant sources, the telescope has to be very cold, only a few degrees above absolute zero, so that the telescope itself does not interfere with the work. After years of deployment tests on Earth, small surprises in space have popped up during the Webb’s deployment, or the “getting-to-know-you phase of the telescope,” Bill Ochs, an engineer at the Goddard Space Flight Center and a project manager for the telescope, told reporters on Monday. Mission managers detected high temperatures on an onboard motor used only in the deployment process, so engineers repointed the telescope on Sunday to protect the device from the sun’s heat. Then the Webb’s solar arrays were readjusted when engineers noticed the telescope had smaller power reserves than expected. One of the most dicey moments came on Tuesday, with the successful unfolding of a giant sunscreen, the size of tennis court. It was designed to keep the telescope in the dark and cold enough so that its own heat wouldn’t obscure the heat detected from distant stars. The screen is made of five layers of a plastic called Kapton, which is similar to Mylar and just as flimsy, and which had occasionally ripped during rehearsals of its deployment. In fact, the unfolding went flawlessly this time. “It went incredibly smoothly. I feel like we’ve all kind of been shocked that there’s been no drama,” said Hillary Stock, a sunshield deployment specialist at Northrop Grumman, the telescope’s primary contractor. Then on Wednesday, the telescope unfurled its secondary mirror, which points at the 18 hexagons, reflecting what the telescope saw back to its sensors. “We’re about 600,000 miles from Earth, and we actually have a telescope,” Mr. Ochs said in the mission operations control room at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. As the telescope ticked off one chore after another, the astronomers who had been waiting 25 years for this telescope began to relax. “Strangely I don’t feel so anxious anymore, my inherent optimism (hello optimism bias & anchoring bias) is in full gear,” Priyamvada Natarajan, a cosmologist from Yale, wrote in an email. Three days later the last mirrors locked in place, and the team at mission control broke into applause and a flurry of high fives and fist bumps. “How does it feel to make history everybody?” Dr. Zurbuchen asked the mission’s managers in Baltimore after the latching was complete. “You just did it.” “NASA is a place where the impossible becomes possible,” said Bill Nelson, the former senator and astronaut who is now NASA’s administrator. Garth Illingworth of the University of California, Santa Cruz, said: “I cannot describe how incredible this feels to have a full mirror. It is an astonishing achievement for the J.W.S.T. Team.” Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories, who chaired a report that led to what would become the Webb telescope, said “what resonates at this moment is the extraordinary ability of our species to collaborate, to organize thousands of people to work carefully, relentlessly, unselfishly, and seemingly endlessly toward some greater human good.” Chanda Prescod Weinstein, an astrophysicist at the University of New Hampshire, echoed his remarks: “This is such a reminder of how successful people can be when they work together.”  While the telescope is considered fully deployed, much remains to be completed. There are still 49 of those “single point failures,” according to Mr. Menzel. Problems with any of them could affect the mission’s individual instruments or the entire spacecraft. By the end of January, the telescope will be in its final orbit at L2. The astronomers will spend the next five months tweaking the mirrors to bring them into common focus and beginning to test and calibrate their instruments. Then real science will begin. Astronomers have said the first picture from the Webb telescope will appear in June, but of what nobody will say. Jane Rigby, a project scientist for the mission at NASA Goddard, said in a news conference on Saturday that the first images made during the mirror alignments will be blurry and ugly. But once the mirrors are coaxed into working together, she said images from the telescope would “knock everyone’s socks off.” “We are planning a series of ‘wow’ images to be released at the end of commissioning when we start normal science operations that are designed to showcase what this telescope can do,” Dr. Rigby said. “I can’t wait for first light and then first science,” Michael Turner, a veteran cosmologist at the Kavli Foundation in Los Angeles, wrote in an email. “It will be even better for our COVID-riddled spirits than Ted Lasso.”"

The South Dakotan, who turned 61 on Friday, had recently told associates that he was considering retirement, complaining about the strain of congressional service and privately expressing concern about former President Donald J. Trump’s continuing grip on the Republican Party. But by seeking re-election in a heavily conservative state, Mr. Thune is well positioned to win again and potentially succeed Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, as the Senate’s top Republican. A host of Senate Republicans leaned on Mr. Thune in recent weeks to run again, but Mr. McConnell was especially aggressive and met privately with him this past week. The Kentucky Republican turns 80 next month and has made clear that he wants to remain his party’s Senate leader into 2023, when he would become the longest-serving party leader in the chamber’s history. It is unclear how long Mr. McConnell will serve beyond then, though, an open question that helped lure Mr. Thune to seek another term. Mr. Thune has told associates he is confident he would have the support to succeed Mr. McConnell when the leader exits. The South Dakotan would face competition for the post, however. Senator John Cornyn of Texas preceded Mr. Thune as the party whip and has indicated his interest in succeeding Mr. McConnell, as has Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, currently the No. 3 Republican. For now, Mr. Thune will have to navigate re-election in South Dakota, which rejected its two most famous senators, George S. McGovern and Tom Daschle, both Democrats, in their bids for fourth terms. Mr. Thune’s only real obstacle, though, would be a primary. He put off a decision on running until the new year because he wanted to minimize the time a potential Republican rival would have to mount a primary challenge — and to limit Mr. Trump’s window for mischief-making. The former president lashed out at Mr. Thune at the end of 2020 after the senator said Mr. Trump’s unfounded election objections would go down “like a shot dog” in the Senate. That prompted the former president, who maintains an iron grip on the Republican Party and has already intervened in a series of 2022 primaries to consolidate his power even further, to deride Mr. Thune as “Mitch’s boy” and a “RINO,” or a Republican in name only. “He will be primaried in 2022, political career over!!!” Mr. Trump warned at the time. But no major primary challenger has emerged. And Mr. Trump’s allies in the Senate said last month that the former president would be unlikely to oppose Mr. Thune if the senator appeared likely to win renomination. Once a hub of prairie populism, South Dakota has turned deeply red in the last two decades, a transition that began with Mr. Thune’s defeat of Mr. Daschle in 2004."

Most P.C.R. and rapid antigen tests can detect Omicron — the Food and Drug Administration has noted there are only a few tests that don’t — but results do not indicate to the user which variant they are infected with, leaving people to guess. Some symptom differences have emerged from preliminary data, but experts are not certain they are meaningful. Data released in December from South Africa’s largest private health insurer, for instance, suggest that South Africans with Omicron often develop a scratchy or sore throat along with nasal congestion, a dry cough and muscle pain, especially low back pain. But these are all symptoms of Delta and of the original coronavirus, too, said Ashley Z. Ritter, an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the chief executive of Dear Pandemic. Given that Omicron has been circulating for only a matter of weeks, she added, “it’s still too early to say that there’s any difference in symptoms between the Omicron variant and previous versions.” It’s likely that the symptoms of Omicron will resemble Delta’s more than they differ. “There’s probably a huge amount of overlap between Omicron and the prior variants, because they are essentially doing the same thing,” said Dr. Otto O. Yang, an infectious disease physician at the University of California, Los Angeles, David Geffen School of Medicine. “If there are differences, they’re probably fairly subtle.” One possible difference is that Omicron may be less likely than earlier variants to cause a loss of taste and smell. Research suggests that 48 percent of patients with the original SARS-CoV-2 strain reported loss of smell and 41 percent reported loss of taste, but an analysis of a small Omicron outbreak among vaccinated people in Norway found that only 23 percent of patients reported loss of taste, and only 12 percent reported loss of smell. It’s unclear, though, whether these differences are because of Omicron or some other factor, like vaccination status. Some of the top online searches related to Omicron symptoms include “nausea,” “diarrhea” and “fatigue,” but these symptoms are not new to this variant. Nausea has always been a common Covid symptom, including with the Omicron variant, said Dr. Jennifer Lighter, an epidemiologist and pediatric infectious diseases specialist at N.Y.U. Langone. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists nausea and vomiting as prevalent symptoms of the virus. People with Omicron may report symptoms like nausea more often because loss of smell is less prevalent with the new variant, said Andrew Pekosz, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. They are paying more attention to milder symptoms like nausea and dizziness, because they are not focused on a sudden loss of smell, he added. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur more often in children than in adults, Dr. Lighter said, but they can happen in adults too. The virus can infect some cells in a patient’s gastrointestinal tract, which would lead to stomach issues like diarrhea, Dr. Pekosz said. Respiratory infections in general may cause people to produce more phlegm as they cough; swallowing that phlegm can then also irritate and upset the stomach. Fatigue is one of the more common Covid symptoms, both with Omicron and with previous variants of the virus, Dr. Lighter said. However, usually if someone is experiencing symptomatic Covid, fatigue will not be the only symptom. To distinguish Covid-related fatigue from general weariness or exhaustion, pay attention to whether it comes on more suddenly, Dr. Pekosz said. “We get run down during the day,” he said, “but if it increases really quickly, that’s a sign that it isn’t just, ‘I didn’t have my coffee this morning.’” Indeed, many Covid-19 symptoms vary depending on a person’s vaccine status. Maya N. Clark-Cutaia, an assistant professor at the New York University Meyers College of Nursing who has been following up with Covid-19 patients throughout the pandemic, said that vaccinated patients with Delta or the original coronavirus tend to present with headache, congestion, sinus pressure and sinus pain, while unvaccinated patients are more likely to have shortness of breath and cough, along with flulike symptoms. With Omicron, Dr. Clark-Cutaia said patients she’s talked to in Pennsylvania are presenting with similar symptoms to Delta. Vaccinated Omicron patients complain of headaches, body aches and fever — “like a really bad cold,” she said. Unvaccinated people have the same shortness of breath, cough and flulike symptoms she saw among unvaccinated people with Delta and the original coronavirus. Omicron seems to have a shorter incubation time than other variants — after a person is exposed, it takes as few as three days for them to develop symptoms, become contagious and test positive compared with four to six days with Delta and the original coronavirus, said Dr. Waleed Javaid, the director of infection prevention and control at Mount Sinai Downtown in New York City. That could be because the variant’s mutations help it attach to and go inside cells, he added. Some encouraging, emerging research shows that Omicron may cause less damage to the lungs, resulting in less severe disease than previous iterations of the virus. Early evidence from Europe also suggests Omicron may cause milder symptoms. In December, three separate research teams concluded that the variant was less likely to send patients to hospitals. According to data from South Africa, after controlling for vaccination status, the risk of hospitalization for adults diagnosed with Omicron was 29 percent lower there than in the first wave of the pandemic, and hospitalized South African Covid-19 patients have been less likely to be admitted to intensive care. But South Africa’s observations may not apply to the United States and other countries. Most South Africans have already been infected with Covid-19, and the median age in South Africa is 27 — both of which might cause the variant to have milder effects there than in the U.S., where the median age is 38, Dr. Yang said. The data also showed that, although children tended to have mild symptoms, they were 20 percent more likely to be hospitalized during the Omicron wave compared with the first wave. “There are people who get severe illness from Omicron,” Dr. Javaid said. Sometimes, early mild symptoms can develop into serious symptoms later, so it’s crucial that people with cold or flulike symptoms be tested and stay home. “It is still a coronavirus. We’re still in a pandemic,” he said."

Putin the high cost he would pay if he sends troops across the border. In interviews, officials described details of those plans for the first time, just ahead of a series of diplomatic negotiations to defuse the crisis with Moscow, one of the most perilous moments in Europe since the end of the Cold War. The talks begin on Monday in Geneva and then move across Europe. The plans the United States has discussed with allies in recent days include cutting off Russia’s largest financial institutions from global transactions, imposing an embargo on American-made or American-designed technology needed for defense-related and consumer industries, and arming insurgents in Ukraine who would conduct what would amount to a guerrilla war against a Russian military occupation, if it comes to that. Such moves are rarely telegraphed in advance. But with the negotiations looming — and the fate of Europe’s post-Cold War borders and NATO’s military presence on the continent at stake — President Biden’s advisers say they are trying to signal to Mr. Putin exactly what he would face, at home and abroad, in hopes of influencing his decisions in coming weeks. The talks on Monday will be led by the deputy secretary of state, Wendy R. Sherman, an experienced diplomat who negotiated the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran. Russian officials are expected to press their demands for “security guarantees,” including prohibiting the deployment of any missiles in Europe that could strike Russia and the placement of weaponry or troops in former Soviet states that joined NATO after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Mr. Putin is also demanding an end to NATO expansion, including a promise that Ukraine could never join the nuclear alliance. While the Biden administration has said it is willing to discuss all Russian security concerns — and has a long list of its own — the demands amount to a dismantling of the security architecture of Europe built after the Soviet Union’s collapse. On Wednesday, members of the NATO alliance will meet with Russia in Brussels. The next day in Vienna, Ukrainian officials will also be at the table, for the first time, for talks at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. But with 57 members, that group is so large that few expect serious negotiations. American diplomats worry that after the whirlwind week, the Russians could declare that their security concerns are not being met — and use the failure of talks as a justification for military action. “No one should be surprised if Russia instigates a provocation or incident,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Friday, and “then tries to use it to justify military intervention, hoping that by the time the world realizes the ruse, it’ll be too late.” This time, he said, “we’ve been clear with Russia about what it will face if it continues on this path, including economic measures that we haven’t used before — massive consequences.”  That warning, however, is an unspoken acknowledgment that the Obama administration’s response in 2014, when Mr. Putin last invaded parts of Ukraine, was too tentative and mild. At that time, Mr. Putin surprised the world by annexing Crimea and fueling a grinding proxy war in eastern Ukraine. Now, American officials say they are trying to learn from their past mistakes. An internal review of those actions, conducted by the White House in recent weeks, concluded that while Obama-era sanctions damaged Russia’s economy and led to a sell-off of its currency, they failed at their central strategic objective: to cause so much pain that Mr. Putin would be forced to withdraw. Nearly eight years later, Russia still holds Crimea and has ignored most of the diplomatic commitments it made in the negotiations that followed, known as the Minsk accords. Those sanctions started with actions against some smaller Russian banks and individuals directly involved in the invasion. Virtually all of the sanctions — and additional measures imposed after Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and after the SolarWinds cyberattack in 2020 that sabotaged computer programs used by the federal government and American companies — remain in place. But there is scant evidence that they have deterred Mr. Putin, who began building up forces near the Ukrainian border just as Mr. Biden announced his response to SolarWinds last spring. When asked recently whether he could point to any evidence that the Russians were deterred by recent sanctions, a senior aide to Mr. Biden paused a moment and then said, “No, none.” Rather than start with moves against small banks and on-the-ground military commanders, officials said, the new sanctions would be directed at cutting off the largest Russian financial institutions that depend on global financial transfers. The plan was described by one official as a “high-impact, quick-action response that we did not pursue in 2014.” The officials declined to say whether the United States was prepared to cut Russia off from the SWIFT system, which executes global financial transactions between more than 1,100 banks in 200 countries. But European officials say they have discussed that possibility — something most major European powers had declined to consider until recently, for fear that Russia might retaliate by attempting to cut off gas and oil flows in the winter, even briefly. The SWIFT cutoff has been used against Iran with some success. But Cynthia Roberts, a professor of political science at Hunter College, noted that Russia had learned a lot about “global sanctions-proofing,” and she expressed doubt that the country would suffer as much as American officials contend if it were disconnected from SWIFT. “They would definitely take a big hit,” she said at a seminar held this past week by the Center for the National Interest. But she noted that Russia had stockpiled hundreds of billions in gold and dollar reserves and that the Bank of China had joined Russia’s own domestic version of SWIFT. That raises the possibility that Russia and China, as part of their expanding partnership, might join forces to help Moscow evade the West’s action. The bottom line, she said, is that “sanctions have a very poor coercive track record.” The technology sanctions would target some of Mr. Putin’s favored industries — particularly aerospace and arms, which are major producers of revenue for the Russian government. The focus would be on Russian-built fighter aircraft, antiaircraft systems, antisatellite systems, space systems and emerging technologies where Russia is hoping to make gains, like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Similar export controls have been surprisingly effective against China’s leading producer of cellphones, Huawei, which for a while was among the top providers of smartphones to the world. That part of its business has all but collapsed in the past year because it cannot obtain advanced chips. But the Russian economy bears little resemblance to China’s, and it is not clear that it is equally vulnerable to an embargo of semiconductors and other microelectronics that are critical to Chinese manufacturing. There are other options under consideration that go well beyond merely banning the sale of computer chips. In one additional step, according to American officials, the Commerce Department could issue a ruling that would essentially ban the export of any consumer goods to Russia — from cellphones and laptop computers to refrigerators and washing machines — that contain American-made or American-designed electronics. That would apply not only to American makers, but also to European, South Korean and other foreign manufacturers that use American chips or software. Unlike China, Russia does not make many of these products — and the effects on consumers could be broad. But a senior European official said there was still a debate about whether the Russian people would blame Mr. Putin, or the United States and its allies, for their inability to buy the goods.  While the Commerce and Treasury Departments work on sanctions that would maximize America’s advantages over Russia, the Pentagon is developing plans that have echoes of the proxy wars of the 1960s and ’70s. To underscore the potential pain for Russia, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, spoke with his Russian counterpart two weeks ago and delivered a stark message: Yes, he said, you could invade Ukraine and probably roll over the Ukrainian military, which stands little chance of repelling a far larger, better armed Russian force. But the swift victory would be followed, General Milley told Gen. Valery Gerasimov, by a bloody insurgency, similar to the one that led to the Soviet retreat from Afghanistan more than three decades ago, according to officials familiar with the discussion. General Milley did not detail to General Gerasimov the planning underway in Washington to support an insurgency, a so-called “porcupine strategy” to make invading Ukraine hard for the Russians to swallow. That includes the advance positioning of arms for Ukrainian insurgents, probably including Stinger antiaircraft missiles, that could be used against Russian forces. More than a month ago, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, created a new interagency planning cell to examine a range of contingencies if Mr. Putin goes ahead with an invasion. The cell, which reports directly to Mr. Sullivan, includes representatives from the National Security Council, the intelligence agencies and the Departments of Defense, State, Treasury, Energy and Homeland Security. The cell is attempting to tailor responses to the many types of attacks that could unfold in the next few weeks, from cyberattacks aimed at crippling Ukraine’s electric grid and pipelines to the seizure of small or large amounts of territory. Intelligence officials said recently that they thought the least likely possibility was a full-scale invasion in which the Russians try to take the capital, Kyiv. Many of the assessments, however, have explored more incremental moves by Mr. Putin, which could include seizing a bit more land in the Donbas region, where war has ground into a stalemate, or a land bridge to Crimea. Several officials familiar with the planning say the administration is looking at European nations that could provide more aid to support Ukrainian forces before any conflict, as well as in the initial stages of a Russian invasion. Lt. Col. Anton Semelroth, a Defense Department spokesman, noted in December that the United States had already committed over $2.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since 2014, including $450 million in 2021 alone. Over the past three months, it has delivered 180 Javelin missiles, two patrol boats, ammunition for grenade launchers, machine guns, secure radios, medical equipment and other items that U.S. officials describe as defensive in nature. But the planning cell is considering more lethal weaponry, such as antiaircraft weapons. After visiting Ukraine last month, Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts and a former Marine officer, said that in his view, “We need to make any incursion by Russia more painful — Day 1 painful, not six months from now painful.” “We have a short window to take decisive action to deter Putin from a serious invasion,” Mr. Moulton said in an interview. “I worry our current deterrent tactics are responding to an invasion rather than preventing it.” One option likely to be discussed at NATO this coming week is a plan to increase, possibly by several thousand, the number of troops stationed in the Baltics and in Southeast Europe. On Friday, Mr. Blinken again warned that if the Russians invade, NATO would deploy more forces along the borders between NATO nations and Russian-controlled territory."

An anti-vaccine star athlete. That paragon of physical health, cloaked in a cape of defiance, declares to the world by example that you don’t have to follow public health policy after all — as long as you win. Which brings us to the top-ranked male tennis player in the world, Novak Djokovic. The sport’s most visible vaccine skeptic, at the start of the pandemic Djokovic said he “wouldn’t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine,” and expressed curiosity about “how we can empower our metabolism to be in the best shape to defend against impostors like Covid-19.” This week Djokovic obtained a medical exemption from tournament organizers for a visa to compete in the Australian Open without being vaccinated. He flew to Melbourne via Dubai. Meanwhile, Australia is dealing with a serious Omicron surge. Victoria state, where the Open is held, recorded almost 22,000 new cases on Wednesday, when Djokovic arrived. It was the largest daily jump in cases of the pandemic. After a 10-hour standoff at the airport, Australian border authorities denied Djokovic’s visa. (His lawyers said he tested positive for the coronavirus in mid-December, meeting Australia’s conditions for exemption.) What’s unfolding in Australia is a dramatic example of disputes we’re seeing play out around the world, in sports and beyond, as institutions weigh public health guidelines against their own needs. Even as the coronavirus surges again, and so does public exhaustion with lockdowns and school closings, sports bodies are compelled to accommodate problematic athlete behavior. They need their biggest talents — and the ticket sales, broadcast viewership, advertising deals and attention that celebrities bring. Athletes have more independent agency than ever, and via social media they have their own huge platforms to express their views directly to fans. This has enabled some athletes to become powerful advocates for social justice, and others to use their fame to advance more questionable positions. Lately, several have used their platforms to amplify anti-science beliefs to an already mistrustful public. The Djokovic saga is exposing an uncomfortable truth for sports institutions: They are only as good as their stars. And the stars are calling the shots. It’s an issue that has arisen in sports many times lately. Notably, Naomi Osaka defied the organizers of the French Open, declining to do post-match news conferences to protect her mental health. She paid for her choice, first in the requisite fines and ultimately by withdrawing altogether from the tournament, but many praised her for her stance. For Osaka, the power of her personal brand allowed her to safeguard her health. For anti-vaccine athletes, however, stardom can give them leeway to flout sensible public health precautions, and act as a champion for others who do the same. “Confronted with this latest virus surge, both the N.B.A. and the N.F.L. have essentially waved the white flag,” wrote Jemele Hill in The Atlantic last week, before the latest unvaccinated player controversy, explaining how leagues are giving in to fans’ desires and letting unvaccinated players compete. She continued: “Now the leagues are choosing instead to cede to the forces of capitalism.” She’s right. In the N.B.A., the Brooklyn Nets have capitulated and allowed Kyrie Irving, a seven-time All-Star, to play part time in away games, the only ones he is legally permitted to play because of his decision to remain unvaccinated. (Players in indoor arenas in New York City must be vaccinated.) In the N.F.L., the Green Bay Packers starting quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who is also the league’s current Most Valuable Player, is vocally anti-vaccine and allowed to play regardless. After he tested positive for the virus in November, Rodgers went on the Pat McAfee Show to explain his views to its audience of 1.6 million. “I believe strongly in bodily autonomy and the ability to make choices for your body,” Rodgers said, “not to have to acquiesce to some sort of woke culture or crazed individuals who say you have to do something.” Athletes have been scorned by some for these views. Meanwhile they got more attention, won more games. That expanded their platform for promoting widely discredited science. Many of these athletes’ fans have rallied to express their support for the stars they identify with. The conversation is as much about fairness as it is about public health. Why should a player get a free pass when other players, and the fans keeping them in business, have to be vaccinated and abide by travel restrictions? Workplaces around the world are filled with Djokovics, difficult but valued or essential employees who expect special accommodations in order to come to work — even when the accommodations they seek are grounded in anti-science views that might put their colleagues at risk. When it comes to athletes, what they do in public health situations matters even more. Beyond the social influence that comes with their platforms, star athletes are symbols of good health, success and leadership — that’s why they’re sought after as the public face of performance apparel and shoe companies, breakfast cereals and countless other brands. And that’s why it’s disappointing to see sports bodies fail to exert the one lever of control that they retain: whether or not athletes are allowed to compete. The Australian Open has had reason to want to salvage this year’s tournament, amid the grimness of another Covid surge. It has already lost Roger Federer, who is recovering from knee surgery. Naomi Osaka is planning to play, but neither Serena nor Venus Williams will attend, for the first time since 1997. The Australian Border Force did what sports bodies are failing to do: say no. If athletes don’t like restrictions imposed on the unvaccinated, they could just get a shot like millions of other people — a privilege that millions more are still waiting for. Now Djokovic has appealed, and is being held in a hotel over the weekend in Australia. In this way he’s no different than the rest of us: stuck in place, awaiting his fate."

That’s the kind of surreal day Thursday was at the Capitol. Donald Trump has so malignantly scrambled his party and this country that we keep seeing tableaus that defy belief and flout history. The last time we took note of Dick Cheney and Patrick Leahy at the Capitol was in 2004 when the then vice president hurled a vulgarity — one not usually heard on the august Senate floor — at the Democratic senator from Vermont. Democrats had accused Cheney of using his government position to help win contracts for his former firm, Halliburton. Now, 17 years later, the two men were back. Senator Leahy was snapping photos at the memorial on the first anniversary of the desecration of the Capitol. And Cheney was there with his daughter Liz, a congresswoman from Wyoming who is persona non grata in her own party and persona grata with the Democrats for speaking truth about Trump. This time, Dick Cheney was not Darth Vader, employing his Death Star to blow up Democrats. This time he was Darling Dick, one of the only Republicans willing to defy Trump and say the obvious: The G.O.P. is embarrassing. His erstwhile critic Nancy Pelosi warmly shook hands with “Vice,” and a cluster of Democrats waited to kiss his ring. Trump is such an egomaniacal thug that Dick Cheney, christened “a self-aggrandizing criminal” by The Atlantic in 2011, seems saintly by comparison. No matter, as The Atlantic pointed out, that as vice president, Cheney “advanced a theory of the executive that is at odds with the intentions of the founders, successfully encouraged the federal government to illegally spy on innocent Americans, passed on to the public false information about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and became directly complicit in a regime of torture for which he should be in jail.” Cheney, who had subverted the Constitution at every turn, was greeted as a defender of the Constitution. From Vice to Nice. This is the world we’re in now. There were other topsy-turvy moments. Republicans, once the outspoken defenders of law enforcement, deserted the Capitol en masse on a day of appreciation for the bravery of the police, dead and alive, who risked their lives holding back the horde, hellbent on shredding democracy, as well as lawmakers, if they could get their hands on them. It’s disgusting that Republicans could not honor the institution they took an oath to protect, or even show up for the cops and other staffers they see every day who were traumatized by Jan. 6. We also saw Tucker Carlson, once a bow-tied preppy struggling to cha-cha-cha on “Dancing With the Stars,” cracking the whip as the Fox High Sparrow, making Ted Cruz grovel and apologize for slipping and accurately using the phrase “terrorist” to describe the Jan. 6 attack. At least Joe Biden finally seemed to recognize that the old days are gone and that the Republicans are not going to be working with him. He came in wanting to knit the country together, but part of the country is not going to be knitted. It’s as if Trump has projected his id into a national psychosis. His father divided the world into killers and losers. So rather than admit that he lost re-election, Trump was willing to egg on a seditious cult to overturn the election. You can just picture him sitting there in the White House, surrounded by McDonald’s wrappers, thrilled at the TV scenes of MAGA hooligans attacking the police. In his speech in Statuary Hall, President Biden pierced the haze of his first year and called out Trump: “He lost.” Without using his name, Biden charged Trump with a profound sin: turning Americans against their own democracy. “Those who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated and incited and those who called on them to do so held a dagger at the throat of America, at American democracy,” he said. Besides his dagger at the throat of democracy, Trump has his party in a chokehold. Republicans may have held back Trump from giving a news conference Thursday, because they know that Nov. 3 and Jan. 6 are dates that make them look awful, but they are still in his vile grip, as evidenced by their shameful flight from the Capitol. (And they didn’t even know “Dear Theodosia” was coming.) Trump’s coup attempt is in its second stage. As NPR reported, the MAGA crowd is working hard in states like Georgia and Arizona, which defied Trump in 2020, to institutionalize Trump’s big lie, with election-deniers running for offices that control the voting process. The Washington Post revealed that “at least 163 Republicans who have embraced Trump’s false claims are running for statewide positions that would give them authority over the administration of elections” and “at least five candidates for the U.S. House were at the Capitol during the Jan. 6 riots.” Biden must make good on his speech and make sure the Vandals who sacked the Capitol are not able to do it again. He must find a way to enact new voting rights laws to head off the Republican efforts to control election certification. If the Dems keep flailing, they could be looking at a wipeout in the House and maybe the Senate and years of kangaroo trials. Hopefully, Merrick Garland is not another Robert Mueller. This is not a moment for punch-pulling."

Once you get used to the buzzer and the cadence of the clues, she explained in a recent interview, you have a significant advantage over a candidate who comes in cold. And Schneider has certainly settled into her groove. On Friday, she became the fourth contestant and the first woman in the history of “Jeopardy!” to surpass $1 million in winnings during regular-season play. She did so on her 28th game, a runaway in which she won over $42,000, continuing a streak that has captured the attention of game-show fans across the country. “It’s not a sum of money I ever anticipated would be associated with my name,” Schneider, a 42-year-old software engineering manager who lives in Oakland, Calif., said in a news release. Schneider, who grew up watching “Jeopardy!” at home with her parents and in eighth grade was voted most likely to appear on the show, has had a whirlwind of a week — for good reasons and bad. On Monday, she tweeted that she had been robbed, losing her credit cards, identification and phone. (As a result, she said she would need to pause her detailed recaps of each game on social media). The $1 million mark is a rare one to reach — Ken Jennings was the first player to do so, in 2004, 30 games into his record 74-game run. But fans have gotten increasingly used to seeing contestants achieve it. James Holzhauer became the second person to hit $1 million during his 32-game streak in 2019. Three months ago, Matt Amodio surpassed $1 million as well, amassing $1.5 million before he was beat after 38 wins. The recent pattern of streaks on the show has fueled theorizing among fans watching from their couches and among members of the show’s production team. Some have postulated that pandemic-related delays in production have benefited some contestants by giving them more time to study. Some point to the increasingly vast amount of resources online. Or, it could just be chance. “To some extent, I think it’s just got to be a statistical fluke,” Schneider said. Schneider is doubtful that the extra time she had to prepare during the pandemic helped her significantly. Ultimately, she said, it’s not something you can cram for. “To be good at ‘Jeopardy!’,” she said, “you just have to live a life where you’re learning stuff all the time.”"

The vending machines, which are planned for neighborhoods in all five boroughs, will also carry toiletries and safe-sex kits, according to Michael McRae, acting executive deputy commissioner of the city’s health department. All items in the vending machines will be free, he said, adding that the department hoped to have the vending machines on the street this year. “This is really about expanding access to health and wellness services,” he said of the initiative, a $730,000 pilot program seeking up to six contractors. The main purpose of the vending machines is to curb overdoses across the city by increasing the availability of naloxone, a drug that works to quickly reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. “Every four hours there’s an overdose here,” Dr. McRae said. “This is something that doesn’t allow for people to die every hour.” As they have across the country, opioid deaths in New York City, have risen significantly during the coronavirus pandemic. There were 2,062 overdose deaths in the city in 2020, according to data published last year by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene — the highest total since reporting on overdose deaths began in 2000 and over 500 more than in 2019. “Overdose deaths in New York City are not equally distributed citywide, with some groups and neighborhoods disproportionately experiencing increases,” the nonprofit Fund for Public Health in New York said last month in a request for proposals from organizations interested in taking the lead on the project. The fund, which issued the request on behalf of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, set a Jan. 20 deadline for proposals. The health department will award the contracts on Jan. 31. According to 2020 health department data, overdose deaths among white New Yorkers had decreased during the preceding three years, while rates among Black New Yorkers had increased in the previous year, and rates among Latinos had increased for five consecutive years. Residents in impoverished Black and Latino neighborhoods like Mott Haven in the South Bronx and East Harlem in Manhattan reported the highest rates of unintentional overdose deaths in 2020. “Structural racism in drug policy and enforcement has been linked to decreased access to services, poorer health outcomes and increased overdose risk,” the request said. The solicitation for proposals identified several neighborhoods as priorities for the machines, including Central Harlem and Union Square in Manhattan, Far Rockaway in Queens, Stapleton in Staten Island and East New York in Brooklyn. Access to clean needles is important to prevent the spread of H.I.V. and hepatitis C as well as skin and soft tissue infections, Mike Selick, an associate director at the National Harm Reduction Coalition, said on Thursday. “We know that syringe access is effective; this is just another form of it,” he said in an interview. Syringe access programs are a proven way to slash H.I.V. infection rates by limiting the reuse of contaminated needles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Proposals like New York’s are “about making the material, the health equipment and the health supplies accessible to the people who need it the most, where they’re already at, on their schedule and on their timeline, and without the stigma or shame,” Sheila P. Vakharia, deputy director for research and academic engagement at the Drug Policy Alliance, said on Thursday. In New York State, people can already get up to 10 clean syringes at pharmacies participating in the state’s Expanded Syringe Access Program. But according to Dr. Vakharia, many drug users would rather avoid a face-to-face interaction with a pharmacist, and many pharmacies are closed late at night, when drug use is more prevalent and people need safe supplies the most. The same for goes for access to naloxone, she added. “It’s a medication that should be readily available and accessible to people when they need it the most, and it doesn’t hurt if we can make it more readily available,” she said. Critics of the proposal have said that the vending machines fail to address the most critical issues around addiction. “I agree we cannot ignore the devastating data on drug addiction and overdoses without doing more,” Councilman David Carr, a Staten Island Republican who represents one of the neighborhoods prioritized in the plan, said in an email on Thursday. “But I feel it is irresponsible to simply place vending machines filled with syringes and Narcan in neighborhoods, without providing addicts the support and real assistance they need,” he added, referring to a brand-name version of naloxone. But advocates of the plan maintain that installing the vending machines is “the smart thing to do.” “We don’t want it to be easier to get dirty needles,” Mr. Selick, of the National Harm Reduction Coalition, said. “We don’t want it to be easier to get drugs on the street than it is to get the help and the supplies and the good information that you need to know.”"

Since its Christmas morning launch, the James Webb Space Telescope has made all the right moves. Now it has passed through the final stretch of its complex deployment phase. In these terminal steps, two panels on either side of the telescope’s array of 18 gold-plated hexagonal mirrors, folded back during launch, were snapped into place to complete Webb’s honeycomb-like reflector. The 21-foot-wide mirror sends light from the cosmos into a secondary mirror, which then bounces the light into the telescope’s main infrared sensor. Unfolding the mirrors is a crucial milestone along the way to using the telescope for scientific studies of the Big Bang, exoplanets, black holes and our solar system. Now that it has been completed, NASA considers the telescope “fully deployed.” The telescope’s unfolding phase wrapped up Saturday morning, after the mirror segment’s right-side panel of its three remaining mirrors was secured into place. The left side completed its deployment on Friday, a process that took five-and-a-half hours. A NASA live video stream showed mission managers monitoring the deployment from the mission control room of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, the telescope’s central operations hub. Around 8:53 a.m. Eastern time, the mission’s managers sent the first commands to begin unfolding the mirrors. Shortly before 10:30, the panel slowly swung open so that the three hexagonal mirrors tessellated snugly with the other 15. Staff applauded before moving on to the next steps of latching the mirrors into place. That process concluded at 1:17 p.m. “How does it feel to make history everybody? You just did it,” Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA’s science chief, said in remarks to the mission’s at the Space Science Telescope Institute in Baltimore. Earlier in the live video program, Dr. Zurbuchen described himself as feeling emotional when the telescope’s mirrors finally clicked into place. “What an amazing milestone,” he said. “We see that beautiful pattern out there in the sky now almost complete.” But it wasn’t possible to see what was happening on the telescope itself. Rockets and some spacecraft carry built-in cameras so engineers on Earth can monitor their behavior in space. So, one would expect engineers to pack cameras aboard the James Webb Space Telescope, the most expensive and technically complex observatory ever launched to space, with 344 “single points of failure.” Think again. There are no monitoring cameras on the telescope. Instead, engineers depend on switches, sensors and motors to track its health during deployment. NASA ditched the idea of including surveillance cameras on Webb because of technical complexities and risk. The telescope’s novel size and shape — with one side of its sunshield deflecting enormous amounts of heat and sunlight and the other instrument-heavy side basking in frigid darkness — would require multiple custom-built cameras. Wires and mounts for those cameras would add weight and risk to an already heavy telescope, the agency explained in a blog post. “It’s not as straightforward as adding a doorbell cam or even a rocket cam,” said Paul Geithner, NASA’s deputy project manager for the technical side of the Webb program. Since Webb’s launch, engineers have completed over a dozen main steps in the deployment phase to bring the telescope to its final form, involving hundreds of moving parts such as switches, motors, pulleys and cables. The process began less than 30 minutes after launch last month, when Webb’s solar array deployed — the only step caught on video as the telescope parted ways in space with its rocket, which had an onboard camera. The telescope has passed a number of milestones since, doing well to defuse astronomers’ anxiety and quell fears that a structure as intricate as Webb was bound to run into snags along its million-mile trek to the place in space where it will stay. The telescope powered on, deployed antennas, mechanically unfolded various limbs and, in the most technically complex milestone, delicately stretched taut five layers of a tennis-court-size plastic sheet designed to shield the telescope’s ultrasensitive camera sensors from the sun’s heat. The Webb telescope was designed to probe a crucial stretch of early cosmic history, known to astronomers as the dark ages. Cosmologists surmise that the first stars appeared when the universe was only about 100 million years old. (Today it is 13.8 billion years old.) The farthest and earliest galaxy seen by astronomers, using the Hubble Space Telescope, dates to when the universe was older, 400 million years after the Big Bang. What happened during those intervening 300 million years when the universe took luminous flight, how the Big Bang turned into a sky full of constellations and life, is a mystery. The telescope will also help astronomers better study supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies and planets orbiting other stars in our galaxy. To achieve these scientific observations, the Webb telescope relies on a primary mirror 6.5 meters in diameter, compared with the mirror on the Hubble, which is 2.4 meters. That gives it about seven times as much light-gathering capability and thus the ability to see further into the past. Another crucial difference is that it is equipped with cameras and other instruments sensitive to infrared, or “heat,” radiation. The expansion of the universe causes the light that would normally be in visible wavelengths to shift into longer infrared wavelengths normally invisible to human eyes. Engineers had to invent 10 new technologies along the way to make the telescope more sensitive than the Hubble. Over-optimistic schedule projections, occasional development accidents and disorganized cost reporting dragged the timeline out to 2021 and ballooned the overall cost to $10 billion.

Inside the envelope was an unopened airmail letter that her husband, John A. Gonsalves, had sent to his mother in Woburn, Mass., when he was a 22-year-old Army sergeant serving in Germany just after the end of World War II. “Dear Mom, Received another letter from you today and was happy to hear that everything is okay,” he wrote on Dec. 6, 1945. “As for myself, I’m fine and getting along okay. But as for the food, it’s pretty lousy most all the time.” In an interview on Friday, nearly a month after she opened the letter, Ms. Gonsalves recalled the flood of emotions she had felt as she read her husband’s words, his neat cursive on faded paper in an envelope with a 6-cent stamp. “It was amazing,” Ms. Gonsalves said. “I really felt like he was there with me.” They met in 1949, when he gave her and her girlfriend a ride home from the shoe factory where they all worked in Woburn, outside Boston. The couple married in 1953, raised five boys together and were married for 61 years, until Mr. Gonsalves died in 2015, at age 92. His letter had been discovered in a Pittsburgh postal facility, Ms. Gonsalves said, and had been delivered to her house on Dec. 9, along with a letter from the Postal Service. “We are uncertain where this letter has been for the past seven-plus decades, but it arrived at our facility approximately six weeks ago,” the letter read, according to WFXT-TV, which reported on it. Citing the letter’s “age and significance to your family history,” the Postal Service said that “delivering this letter was of utmost importance to us.” Kim Frum, a Postal Service spokeswoman, said she could not comment on the letter without additional details. “In many cases like this, it does not involve mail that had been lost in our network and later found,” she said. “What we typically find in cases of old letters and postcards is that they are sometimes purchased at flea markets, antique shops and even online and re-entered into our system.” Ms. Gonsalves’s oldest son, also named John Gonsalves, said that postal workers had been trying for weeks to track down the family so they could deliver the letter. The original recipient, Mr. Gonsalves’s mother, died decades ago, and her old address in Woburn is no longer a family home. In November, Mr. Gonsalves said, he received a phone message from a postal employee in Pittsburgh who said he wanted to speak to him about his father. Since his father had died years ago, he said, he had assumed the call was a scam. A secretary at the church where Mr. Gonsalves’s funeral had been held also received a call from the postal employee, the son said, and had relayed the message to Ms. Gonsalves. She, too, assumed it was a scam. “We kind of let it go, our entire family, and, then, nine days later, my mother gets the registered letter from Pittsburgh,” the son said. “It was crazy.” Mr. Gonsalves had sent his letter from Bad Orb, Germany, a town near a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp, Stalag IX B, that had been liberated by American forces months earlier. In the letter, Mr. Gonsalves asks his mother not to send him any more packages, telling her he doesn’t think he will be there much longer. He laments the “lousy weather” and asks about his friends Jim and Bill. He says he hopes to be home in January or February of 1946. He signed the letter, “Love + XXXXX, Your Son, Johnny. P.S. I’ll be seeing you soon, I hope.” After the war, Mr. Gonsalves earned an engineering degree and worked for years for GTE Corporation. He used his engineering skills to run copper pipes from the family’s sprawling Victorian to a hot-water tank on the roof of the garage so there would be enough water for everyone to shower, his son said. He also devised an LED panel that would show which lights in the house had been left on. “His mind was always going,” the son said. “He was always thinking of things.” Ms. Gonsalves said that she missed her husband and that the letter reflected how much he had loved his family and worried about them, even when he was serving overseas. “It was just so nice that he cared so much about all of them, because that’s the way he was,” she said. “I could’ve sworn I felt his presence here while I was reading the letter, honestly and truly, which is strange, but that’s how I felt.”"

The Bahamian minister of foreign affairs, Fred Mitchell, who said he became friends with Mr. Poitier when he served as the Bahamian nonresident ambassador to Japan from 1997 to 2007, described him as a giant and a role model.  “He was a Bahamian who was able to stride across the world like a colossus,” Mr. Mitchell said in an interview on Friday. “And it is therefore possible for any other Bahamian to do that, to follow in that route, and he leaves a legacy of enormous respect and has left an indelible mark for Bahamians across the world.” Mr. Poitier, who died on Thursday night at his residence in Los Angeles at the age of 94, was the son of tomato farmers on Cat Island, a 150 square mile spindle of land with a population today of about 1,500.  The youngest of nine children, he wore clothes made from flour sacks and never saw a car until his father moved the family to Nassau in 1937 after Florida banned Bahamian tomatoes. He moved to Miami to live with a brother when he was 14, then a year later to New York City, where he started his long acting career.  Mr. Mitchell said that, like many people in the Bahamas, he grew up knowing Mr. Poitier as an Hollywood icon, watching his films at the Capitol Theater in Nassau.  “He was the son of two ordinary Bahamians from Over-the-Hill and Cat Island,” Mitchell said. “And he had extraordinary success on the world stage, on the screen, so that every movie that came out, my mother made sure that all of us, as children, were bundled up and sent to the Capitol Theatre on Market Street to see these movies.” But Mr. Poitier’s influence in the Bahamas was not limited to the big screen. He was also remembered as a driving force behind the push in 1967 to elect a parliament that reflected the nation’s Black majority in what was then a British colony. He gave logistical support to the Progressive Liberal Party under Lynden O. Pindling, the nation’s first Black prime minister, who led the Bahamas to independence in 1973, Mr. Mitchell said.  “He used his celebrity status, his connection with his friends in the United States to help promote majority rule for our country,” Mr. Mitchell said. “And he was very much a part of it, no question.” Franklyn Wilson, a former PLP cabinet minister, said Mr. Poitier wielded considerable political influence. Mr. Poitier’s house on New Providence island became the scene of Sunday afternoon political seminars in the late 1960s, where he and Mr. Pindling would discuss public policy.  “We would have these sessions at Sidney’s house on Winton Highway,” Mr. Wilson recalled. “And, by and large, Sidney was such a captivating figure that you can’t really say it was a conversation. You could describe it more accurately as lectures.” “When he started speaking, you just were in awe,” Mr. Wilson added. “And his realness just came across so clearly. The persona you saw in the world of cinematography and all that was the real man.” Mr. Wilson recalled that Mr. Poitier had once told him, “When you walk through the door of opportunity, you have one responsibility, and that is to make sure you leave the door open.” “He kicked down the door,” Mr. Wilson said. “He didn’t just leave it open. He kicked it down.” Growing up in the Bahamas, Sidney Poitier used to stare at the sky at night and wonder why the stars disappeared at dawn. That sense of wonder never left him. “My life has held an enchanting fascination with the universe,” Mr. Poitier wrote in the acknowledgments to his little-known science-fiction novel, “Montaro Caine.” Published in 2013 by Spiegel & Grau, “Montaro Caine” was a surprising detour for Mr. Poitier, but the project was in keeping with his more mystical side, his editor Cindy Spiegel said. “In a way, this novel encapsulated his entire worldview,” she said. “He talked about it as the message that he wanted to leave to his children and grandchildren, which is a message about bringing people together, people from all different backgrounds, even aliens in this case.” A fable of sorts about humanity’s future, the novel centers on Montaro Caine, the chief executive of a mining company, who is presented with a mysterious coin that was discovered in the hand of a newborn baby girl and is composed of metals that don’t exist on earth. The coin matches one that Caine has seen before, and it sets off a frenzy among scientists, corporations and collectors seeking to exploit its value. The mystery deepens when Caine learns that the design on the coin matches a pattern hanging on the wall of a medicine man’s hut on a Caribbean island. When Ms. Spiegel got the novel on submission, she was delighted by its wild premise and was determined to publish it, even though in its early form, it was “kind of a mess.” “He’s not a novelist, obviously; he had never written a novel, and this was extremely ambitious,” she said. “The plot is a bit outlandish, but it’s so compassionate and filled with authenticity and imagination and reach, and it’s not confined to the typical genre requirements of the novel,” she added. “It’s just where his imagination took him.” President Biden paid tribute to Sidney Poitier on Friday evening, remembering him as a “once-in-a-generation actor and advocate” whose work “changed the world on and off the big screen.” In a statement, Mr. Biden called Mr. Poitier “one of the finest actors in our history” — and went further. Pointing to his performances in films such as “The Defiant Ones,” “A Raisin in the Sun,” “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” and “In the Heat of the Night,” Mr. Biden said that Mr. Poitier had “held a mirror up to America’s racial attitudes in the 1950s and 1960s.” “With unflinching grandeur and poise — his singular warmth, depth and stature onscreen — Sidney helped open the hearts of millions and changed the way America saw itself,” Mr. Biden said in the statement. Citing Mr. Poitier’s working-class roots, Mr. Biden said the actor had “blazed a path for our nation to follow, and a legacy that touches every part of our society today.” “Jill and I send our love and prayers to Sidney’s wife, Joanna, his daughters, and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren,” Mr. Biden said. “May God bless Sidney Poitier.” Tributes to and memories of Sidney Poitier poured in to the comment section of his obituary in The New York Times. Some readers recalled meeting the actor, including in the Bahamas, where he spent part of his childhood. Others recalled the effect his movies had on their lives. Here are a few of the highlights. (Some comments have been edited for length.) Do you have a memory of Mr. Poitier? Join the conversation here. Sidney Poitier’s choices — onscreen and off — helped shape a rich civil rights legacy. While he spent much of his childhood in the Bahamas, where Black residents held positions of power and for the most part he was not exposed to racism, his teenage years in Miami, in the 1940s, revealed a very different portrait of Black life in America. “He was outdone by what life was like here in the South during that time,” said Evalina Bestman, Mr. Poitier’s cousin. “We had many conversations where he talked about the worth of human beings. He believed deeply in equality.” Indeed, it was in Miami, he said in a 1999 interview with The Associated Press, where he “learned quite quickly that there were places I couldn’t go, that I would be questioned if I wandered into various neighborhoods.” As an actor, Mr. Poitier broke barriers with roles that challenged social norms, turning down parts he found offensive or stereotypical. Those decisions emphasized “the power of visibility,” said Marc H. Morial, president and chief executive of the National Urban League. “He was one of the first that spoke out for racial justice at a time when it was risky, when he had a following of both Black and white audiences,” Mr. Morial said of Mr. Poitier. “If you think about the time period, it took a lot of courage to be a champion of civil rights.” Offscreen, Mr. Poitier supported the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He also participated in the March on Washington in 1963, at which Dr. Martin Luther King delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech. A few years later, Dr. King later called Mr. Poitier “a man of great depth, a man of great social concern,” who was “dedicated to human rights and freedom.” In the early 1960s, the fellow actor and his close friend Harry Belafonte recruited Mr. Poitier to drive with him to Mississippi to deliver $70,000 for Freedom Summer volunteers. While there, they were chased by Klansmen, who fired guns at them. The harrowing experience only further strengthened his resolve to fight racial injustice. “He didn’t brag about the work he was doing,” Ms. Bestman, 80, said of her cousin. “But it was clear that the civil rights movement was truly important to him.” His vision of equality meant seeing all aspects of his humanity. “You sit here and ask me such one-dimensional questions … about the ‘Negro-ness’ of my life,” he said in a 1967 news conference. “I am an artist, man, American, contemporary,” he continued, and “so I wish you would pay me the respect due.” Louis Gossett Jr., the veteran 85-year-old stage and screen actor who starred in the original 1959 Broadway production and subsequent film of Lorraine Hansberry’s “A Raisin in the Sun” alongside Sidney Poitier, is succinct. “If there was no Sidney Poitier,” he said from his Atlanta home on Friday, “there’d be no Louis Gossett Jr.” Poitier won ecstatic reviews for his starring turn on Broadway as Walter Lee Younger, a Black chauffeur bursting with big dreams on the South Side of Chicago. “Mr. Poitier is a remarkable actor with enormous power that is always under control,” Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times. “He is as eloquent when he has nothing to say as when he has a pungent line to speak. He can convey devious processes of thought as graphically as he can clown and dance.” Critics were just as enthusiastic about the 1961 film: The Times’s Bosley Crowther wrote that Poitier is “lithe and electric” and “emits the lightning of an angry, violent man who dreams of smashing the chains of his economic enslavement with a little money into which the family has come.” In a phone conversation, Gossett reflected on the lessons Poitier taught him on the set of “A Raisin in the Sun”; adventures from their Broadway days; and the lasting impact of a man he considered family. These are edited excerpts. The 1961 adaptation of “A Raisin in the Sun” was your film debut. What do you remember about the experience? It was very exciting. It was educational with all those great actors in it — Sidney, Ruby Dee, Claudia McNeil, Diana Sands, Ivan Dixon — that was royalty. You and Poitier had both starred in the Broadway production that won critical acclaim in 1959. What advice did he give you about translating that success to film? He didn’t know it, but he taught me some wonderful cinematic tricks about staying on the screen, instead of the editor going somewhere else. You learn that as you learn acting in front of a camera. So now it’s instinctual to make love for the cameraman and the editor and the director and the writer. What was the reception of the film like? I was pleasantly surprised. It was a tricky part of history, so it was a pleasure and a blessing to be part of that success. And it led to more success. People from that cast — Ivan Dixon, Ruby Dee — we all made it because of the leg up we got from “A Raisin in the Sun.” What was he like when the cameras were off? He was a very charismatic young man. Very brilliant. He grew up on Cat Island, and going from there, where it was majority Black people, to America, where it was majority white folks, was an adjustment that he had to make. It was very hard getting rid of his accent. He was up on the rooftops of buildings where he would study the newscasts so he could talk. Do you have any memorable stories from your Broadway days? I remember that we played poker on Saturday night between shows, and he owes me $75. You think I’ll get it? [Laughs]. He had a full house with 10s and I had a full house with jacks. And I remember going to lunch after the Wednesday and Saturday matinees. Me and Ivan Dixon and Robert Hooks, who was the understudy, had to do like a football plan. One person would run out and go left toward Times Square, and the other one would run out and go right toward Eighth Avenue, and half the fans that were waiting to see him would follow those two, and then when it was really narrow, Sidney would run out and go into the hotel and come out the other side and go into Downey’s, which was a famous restaurant. And he’d get a proper lunch and dinner without being bombarded with fans. He was very hot. I can see it, just knowing how crazy New York is nowadays. Oh, now it’s worse. It was a lot of fun. It was a great learning period from [the theater director] Lloyd Richards and all of them, with Sidney as the king. What’s the most important thing he taught you? The most important thing I took from him is the art of acting in front of a camera or in front of people. I had the talent, and I had the good studies in the class, but with him, it became an art. Every time he did it onstage or in a movie, it was like the first time. It was very difficult for me not to copy him. It forced me into going originally to my talent God gave me. What does he mean to you? Him and his wife are family. I call him once a month to check in. We wound up in the same places, him doing one thing and me doing another in the same cities. If he was around, I’d have to go see him. We had a good time. A great time. I loved him a lot. Late in his career, Sidney Poitier found a space on television for the kind of inspirational performances that had marked his decades in film. In the 1991 mini-series “Separate but Equal,” he played Thurgood Marshall, challenging school segregation in the Brown v. Board of Education case; the Times critic John J. O’Connor called his performance “simply splendid.” The last of his great roles was as the anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela in the 1997 Showtime film “Mandela and de Klerk,” opposite Michael Caine as F.W. de Klerk, the South African president who released Mandela from prison and negotiated the end of apartheid with him. (It was a reunion for Mr. Poitier and Mr. Caine, who had worked together in the apartheid-themed thriller “The Wilby Conspiracy” in 1975.) The film, which is available to rent on Amazon, is a typically dutiful, straightforward cable historical drama. But it’s elevated by Mr. Poitier’s complex performance, which synthesizes Mandela the icon and Mandela the man. His Mandela is wily, steely, patient and quick-witted, but careful with every word. Even as a prisoner, he can turn the slightest straw into a political lever. Maybe one reason for the performance’s potency is the resonance between actor and character. Mr. Mandela, the film points out, was seen as a terrorist by the white government yet also wrestled with more militant factions of his own party, much as Mr. Poitier himself took flak for the straight-arrow characters with which he helped integrate Hollywood. Mr. Mandela pursued a revolution from confinement, much as Mr. Poitier changed the movies despite the strictures on his roles. And Mr. Mandela, according to a story shared by the actor Will Smith in 2007, was influenced by Mr. Poitier himself, having watched “In the Heat of the Night” while imprisoned. After later learning that the South African prison authorities had censored the scene in which Mr. Poitier’s character slaps a white man, Mr. Mandela was heartened by “the idea that American movies were putting out that type of imagery,” which meant that “the possibility of change is real and obtainable.” Mr. Poitier’s most intriguing TV role, however, was one he never took: He was offered the role of president in NBC’s “The West Wing” that ultimately went to Martin Sheen. It’s tantalizing to wonder how the series might have been different had a late-career Mr. Poitier played a Black president, nearly a decade before Barack Obama. Though it remains true, fictional presidency or no, that Sidney Poitier led America from the screen. In an instant, Sidney Poitier moved America into the age of Black Power. The year, 1967. The movie, “In the Heat of the Night.” In the scene, the debonair Virgil Tibbs (Poitier), a Black homicide detective from Philadelphia, now in Sparta, Miss., is questioning Endicott (Larry Gates), a wealthy white plantation owner, about a murder. Angered, Endicott slaps him. Empowered, Tibbs slaps him back. My family referred to it as “the slap heard around the world.” Mr. Poitier has said that he insisted the slap back be added to the script. For a generation of African Americans, like my mother, who came of age during the civil rights movement, Virgil Tibbs was a revelation. He was practicing self-defense, while the movement leaders championed nonviolence. He channeled Black rage in an era of racial forgiveness. And as played by Mr. Poitier, Tibbs was so dignified and charismatic onscreen — the embodiment of Black excellence — that stereotypes about Black inferiority, often used by men like Endicott to justify segregation in the real world, appeared completely absurd and antiquated. Just as important, Mr. Poitier modeled a new image of Black masculinity — controlled, defiant, intellectual — that helped liberate the next generation of African Americans. Sidney Poitier made history in 1964 as the first Black performer to win an Oscar in the best-actor category, for Ralph Nelson’s comedy-drama “Lilies of the Field,” in which Mr. Poitier played Homer Smith, an itinerant worker who helps a group of nuns build a chapel in rural Arizona. “Because it is a long journey to this moment, I am naturally indebted to countless numbers of people,” he said in his acceptance speech, in which he thanked the creative team behind the film, his agent, and the members of the Academy. “For all of them, all I can say is a very special thank you.” Anne Bancroft, who had won the best actress Oscar in 1963 for her role as Anne Sullivan in “The Miracle Worker,” presented Mr. Poitier with the award. He was competing against Albert Finney (“Tom Jones”), Richard Harris (“This Sporting Life”), Rex Harrison (“Cleopatra”) and Paul Newman (“Hud”). When Mr. Poitier accepted an honorary Academy Award in 2002, he took a similar tack, thanking the “handful of visionary American filmmakers, directors, writers and producers” he said made his career possible by going against the odds. “Without them, this most memorable moment would not have come to pass and the many excellent young actors who have followed in admirable fashion might not have come as they have to enrich the tradition of American filmmaking as they have,” Mr. Poitier said. The elegance, the poise, the steely spine — but, oh, the face — when I think of Sidney Poitier, I first think of how beautiful he was and the sheer physical perfection of the man. He had the kind of old-fashioned Hollywood beauty and glamour that made the movies and made audiences dream and desire, turning them into repeat customers. There was much more to Poitier, yes, and he will be rightly remembered as a towering figure in the civil rights movement, one that has always been fought on the screen and not only in the streets and courts. But we should also honor and be grateful for his beauty, what it meant and what it did. Physical beauty has its obvious attractions, but it can be a powerful weapon, too. That’s one reason Jim Crow Hollywood had such profound difficulty with Black beauty, which threatened the racist order that the industry upheld, reproduced and eagerly helped legitimize for its audiences. It’s also why Walter White, the head of the N.A.A.C.P., said in the 1940s that Lena Horne would be an “interesting weapon” against Hollywood racism. The industry ignored and marginalized Black performers, relegating them to the margins of the frame, where they often wore servant costumes and spoke in insulting dialect if they even said anything. Sometimes their names weren’t in the credits; at times their musical numbers were edited out. The most instructive racist tell is that the industry’s self-censoring Production Code banned sexual relations between Black and white performers — not all people of color, just Black. Hollywood banned what the Code called miscegenation until 1957. At that point, Poitier had been acting in movies for a decade. He had made some intriguing films, and his name was being featured more prominently in the advertising. The next year, though, he catapulted to another level with the release of “The Defiant Ones,” about two escaped prisoners who are chained together and, while on the run, grow to care for each other. Directed by Stanley Kramer, it is a prime example of liberal white Hollywood at its most sincere and self-congratulatory. However hokey, exasperating and contradictory “The Defiant Ones” is, there is also no denying the charms and charisma of its two very handsome and exceedingly fit leads. Poitier wasn’t thrilled when Tony Curtis, who was trying to escape his pretty-boy image, was cast as the other prisoner. But it was apparently Curtis who asked that the two men share top billing, even though contractually only Curtis had that privilege. This immeasurably elevated Poitier’s stature, as did the movie’s great box-office success, making him a bona fide star. I have to think that the jaw-dropping lollapalooza of a poster for “The Defiant Ones” also had something to do with both its success and Poitier’s transformation into a matinee idol. The poster is drawn and vaguely reminiscent of the work of the painter George Bellows with a touch of Tom of Finland. It shows two heavily muscled prisoners facing each other while still chained, snarling and bare-chested. The two figures don’t look much like the performers that they’re meant to represent; instead, they look like bodybuilders who, after mainlining steroids to bulk up, have lost their minds and found themselves in scalding water. The poster emphasizes their antagonism, which may have appealed to some high-minded American audiences. Mostly and unambiguously, the poster was doing what film posters often did: It was selling sex through two semi-naked hotties who were definitely going to get down somehow. This was different from the grotesquely racist images of brutish Black masculinity that the movies had historically trafficked in à la “The Birth of a Nation.” Here were two men, Black and white, chained together and forced into a fateful union. In the poster the Poitier figure is positioned slightly higher than the Curtis one and has one hand on the chain, as if to pull the other man closer. This gesture may have been another white liberal appeal, but in one sense it also represents Poitier’s historic position as a crossover star, someone who could take up equal space onscreen alongside white performers, including in friendships, as in the lovely “Paris Blues” (1961), in which his and Paul Newman’s jazz musicians share a palpably warm camaraderie. In time, Poitier was also cast as the romantic lead alongside white actresses, though it was complicated. In “A Patch of Blue” (1965), his character becomes involved with a blind woman, and in “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” (1967), he plays a caricature of perfection who gently rocks the world of his young white fiancée’s parents. Hollywood had understood and profited from Poitier’s magnetism, and it wanted to continue to exploit it yet also wanted him restrained, polite, sexless. It couldn’t deal with his full humanity. One of the few times that he’d played a rounded character, one who was desiring and desirable was in “Paris Blues,” in which his character has a romance with Diahann Carroll. (The story originally featured an interracial affair.) In 1967, The New York Times published a profile of Poitier with the headline “He Doesn’t Want to Be Sexless Sidney.” It’s a sobering, tough read. He’d found success, certainly, but he was frustrated, noting that he’d never worked onscreen in a “man-woman relationship that was not symbolic.” He wasn’t interested in “a romantic interlude” with a white woman. He wanted to work with Black actresses. He wanted to put Black women on a pedestal. He wanted to give his daughters “a sense of self” and “the concept of beauty” that TV commercials didn’t provide them. He wanted to make the movies he wanted to make. From then on, he said, “I will continue to be a hero, but I won’t be a neuter,” a purposeful, profound declaration of independence. Two years later, Poitier founded his own production company, First Artists, with Newman and Barbra Streisand. In 1972, he made his directorial debut with the western “Buck and the Preacher,” in which he played a former Union soldier, Buck, who leads Black wagon trains from Louisiana to Kansas. Ruby Dee played his wife, and Harry Belafonte was Preacher. Together they ride and rob and fight to shepherd Black families to safety. It’s a wonderful, loose, galvanizing film, the start of a directing career that included hits like “Uptown Saturday Night” and “Let’s Do It Again.” He made the movies he had sought to make. In his 1967 interview, he said that “I have not made my peace with the times — they are still out of kilter — but I have made my peace with myself.” The times remained out of kilter, even as Poitier kept rising above them. HOLLYWOOD, Fla. — The Bahamian diaspora remembered the actor Sidney Poitier on Friday as a son of their soil, among the island’s greatest ambassadors. Mr. Poitier was born in Miami — home to generations of Bahamians — but he spent part of his childhood in the Bahamas. His dual roots helped to cultivate a deep following in both South Florida and the Caribbean country, which renamed the bridge to Paradise Island after the actor about 10 years ago as part of the island’s 40th anniversary of its independence. “He was larger than life in our community, especially for an island as small as the Bahamas,” said Dewey Knight, 57, whose grandparents moved from the Bahamas to the United States in the 1930s. “We saw him as the standard-bearer. What made him so special is he took pride in the Bahamas and contributed to the island.” Mr. Knight said he met Mr. Poitier in the elevator of a Miami building in the 1970s, when Mr. Knight was a child. “We saw him as our own and a representative for both the Bahamas and the larger African diaspora,” Mr. Knight continued. “When you talk about the Bahamas, you talk about three things: the beautiful beaches, conch and our Sidney Poitier.” Andy Ingraham, who was born in the Bahamas and raised in South Florida, said he was struck by how “warm and accessible” Mr. Poitier was in person. He was a child when he first met Mr. Poitier on the island, he said, and several years ago, he attended an intimate birthday dinner in Los Angeles celebrating Mr. Poitier. “His conversation was so inviting and supportive,” said Mr. Ingraham, president and C.E.O. of the National Association of Black Hotel Owners, Operators and Developers. “He never shied away from his Bahamian story, always sharing. His message was however small your beginnings, you can make it to a world stage.” Harry Belafonte, a longtime friend and constant collaborator with Sidney Poitier, remembered him on Friday as a “brother and partner” who worked with him to try to improve the world. “For over 80 years, Sidney and I laughed, cried and made as much mischief as we could,” Mr. Belafonte said in a statement. “He was truly my brother and partner in trying to make this world a little better. He certainly made mine a whole lot better.” Denzel Washington has shared many words of admiration and praise for Sidney Poitier over the decades, and on Friday, he offered some words of remembrance. “It was a privilege to call Sidney Poitier my friend,” he said in a statement. “He was a gentle man and opened doors for all of us that had been closed for years. God bless him and his family.” They first met in 1977 when Mr. Washington, just out of college and new to Los Angeles, spotted the legendary actor in a bookstore on Wilshire Boulevard, Washington recalled while presenting Mr. Poitier with an American Film Institute Life Achievement Award in 1992. “Sidney Poitier, literally the man of my dreams,” he remembered thinking. “He meant everything to me,” Mr. Washington, now a two-time Oscar winner, told the audience. “He was a positive example of elegance and good taste. He was a source of pride for millions of African Americans. He was a great movie star that was appreciated by millions of people around the world.” That day in ’77, Mr. Poitier took time to speak to a young aspiring actor, Mr. Washington added: “He was very patient with me. He was very kind to me.” In 2002, Mr. Washington presented Mr. Poitier with an honorary Oscar for his body of work. “Before Sidney, African American actors had to take supporting roles in major studio films, that were easy to cut out in certain parts of the country,” he said. “But you couldn’t cut Sidney Poitier out of a Sidney Poitier picture. He was the reason a movie got made — the first solo, above the title, African American movie star. He was unique.” Former President Barack Obama, who awarded Sidney Poitier with the Presidential Medal of Freedom during his first term in office, honored the actor on Friday, praising what he said was Mr. Poitier’s “singular talent” and ability to reveal “the power of movies to bring us closer together.” Mr. Obama awarded the medal — the highest civilian honor a president can bestow — to Mr. Poitier in a 2009 ceremony in the East Room of the White House during which he exchanged a poignant hug with the actor. “Through his groundbreaking roles and singular talent, Sidney Poitier epitomized dignity and grace, revealing the power of movies to bring us closer together,” Mr. Obama said in a tweet Friday afternoon. “He also opened doors for a generation of actors. Michelle and I send our love to his family and legion of fans.” The actress Kerry Washington thanked Sidney Poitier on Friday, writing that the actor had opened the door for others like her. “We lost an elegant King today,” she wrote in a tweet. “Thank you Sidney Poitier. For not only opening the door, but for walking in this world with endless grace and excellence, so that today, still, we follow behind you, reaching toward the example that you set.”"

Mr. Djokovic, who hopes to defend his men’s singles title at the Australian Open this month, was denied permission to enter the country on Thursday after arriving at a Melbourne airport. The border authorities said they canceled his visa because he had not provided evidence to justify being exempted from Australia’s requirement that arrivals be vaccinated against the coronavirus. In the filing on Saturday, Mr. Djokovic’s lawyers said he had been granted a vaccine exemption by Tennis Australia because of a positive Dec. 16 coronavirus test result, and because 14 days later, he had not had a fever or respiratory symptoms in 72 hours. The conditions of the exemption were consistent with the recommendations of Australia’s immunization advisory body, the lawyers argued. Given these circumstances, among others, “Mr. Djokovic understood that he was entitled to enter Australia,” the filing read. Mr. Djokovic, a vaccine skeptic, is in quarantine at a hotel in Melbourne as he awaits a hearing, scheduled for Monday, on his appeal of the government’s decision to revoke his visa. He announced in June 2020 that he and his wife had tested positive for the coronavirus, but his December infection had not previously been disclosed. Mr. Djokovic’s lawyers argue that the Australian authorities, in canceling his visa, “radically and fundamentally” misconstrued or misapplied advice from Australia’s immunization advisory body about whether a coronavirus infection within the past six months should exempt him from the vaccination requirement. The filing also claims that Mr. Djokovic was denied procedural fairness after arriving in Australia, when he was held at the airport by the immigration authorities from about midnight to 8 a.m. His lawyers say Mr. Djokovic was initially told by immigration officials that a decision about his visa would not be made until after 8:30 a.m., after he had a chance to speak to Tennis Australia officials. But around 6 a.m., they say, he was pressured to consent to an immediate decision. He relented, “feeling he had no choice,” and was notified at 7:42 a.m. that his visa had been canceled, according to the filing. The Australian Border Force declined to comment on the filing, citing the pending court hearing. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said that the revocation of Mr. Djokovic’s visa was “simply a matter of following the rules.” If Mr. Djokovic’s appeal fails, he could be barred from entering Australia for three years, under rules applicable to people whose visas are canceled. Separately, the Australian Border Force on Saturday night said that two others linked to the tennis tournament whom it had been investigating had left the country. “The Australian Border Force (ABF) investigation into the visa status of two other individuals connected to the Australian Open has concluded,” it said in an emailed statement. “The ABF can confirm both individuals have now voluntarily departed Australia.” The statement did not identify the two individuals, but local news media had reported the investigations a few days earlier. On Friday, the Czech foreign ministry confirmed in a statement that a Czech player, Renata Voracova, had been placed in the same detention as Mr. Djokovic, along “with several other tennis players.” She had “proven noninfectious status in a way that entitles her to participate in the tournament,” and had already played at a warm-up event, the statement said, but had “decided to give up further participation in the tournament and leave Australia due to the limited possibility of training.” The Australia Broadcasting Corporation also reported that a European tennis official under similar circumstances had left the country."

Schools in the nation’s largest district opened as planned on Monday, amid an extraordinary rise in cases fueled by the highly contagious Omicron variant, which has again turned New York into a coronavirus epicenter. A new testing system went into effect this week, with rapid tests available in every school. Attendance hovered around 70 percent throughout the week, though it fell to 44 percent on Friday, an extremely low percentage that coincided with the first snowstorm of the winter. In two dozen interviews with parents, teachers and students this week, New Yorkers were divided over whether schools should currently be open for in-person learning, but most echoed a familiar feeling of unease. Matt Baker, a high school math teacher at Brooklyn Latin School, which straddles Williamsburg and Bushwick, said the week had been chaotic. “We’re trying to help kids that aren’t here, but also the kids that are here,” he said. “It’s not clear how long they’re going to be out, we’re just trying to get by.” “I’m happy that schools are open in general,” Mr. Baker said. “I’m just not convinced that they should have opened this week.” Mayor Eric Adams, who took office just two days before schools reopened after the winter break, has been adamant that the system will remain open despite the surge in virus cases and hospitalizations. New York has been more aggressive than many other large cities in keeping its schools open. That policy has been supported by many public health experts and parents whose children struggled during virtual schooling, although some parents say they would prefer a longer-term remote learning option. The reopening had so far been largely successful, as in-school virus transmission was extremely low in the year or so from when schools began to reopen to when Omicron hit. But the contagiousness of the variant presents a unique challenge, and keeping schools safe — while reassuring families and educators — has emerged as the first major test of leadership for the new mayor. “The safest place for children is in a school building,” Mr. Adams said during a television interview on Thursday. “There’s no getting around that. That’s the science, that’s the fact. That is not spreading fear.” Speaking at a news conference on Friday, the mayor said he wanted to provide parents with clarity that schools would be open and stay open, after a string of delays and changes to the school reopening plan. He and others have pointed to all the ways in which conditions are different than they were earlier in the pandemic. New York’s educators were given access to vaccines nearly a full year ago, before some immunocompromised people and other vulnerable groups. All adults working in city buildings are required to be vaccinated. Nearly all city schoolchildren are eligible for vaccines, although over half have not received a shot. Testing, though still limited, is more widely available than during previous surges. And though Omicron is more contagious than previous variants and more likely to spur breakthrough infections, some evidence suggests that it causes milder illness than previous variants, especially in vaccinated people. There is also much less political friction with the city’s teachers’ union than there was earlier in the pandemic; Mr. Adams and Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, have said they are working together closely to keep schools open. Solange Farina sent her daughter, a high school freshman, back to school in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan this week. Ms. Farina, who lives in Astoria, Queens, said she didn’t feel nearly as frightened as she did when schools first shut down in the spring of 2020. “But I definitely don’t feel hopeful like I did last June, before Delta,” she said. “I’m kind of going day by day,” she said. “It’s just stressful living in this moment.” Attendance data from this past week demonstrated the moment’s challenges. About a third of parents kept their children at home. Interviews with parents around the city highlighted the divide that exists among them. Standing outside Public School 112 in East Harlem this week, Erica Alvarez said supervising remote learning for her 7-year-old son earlier in the pandemic was “one of the hardest periods” of her life. This week, she said: “So far, everything is all right. They have made me feel comfortable.” But a few blocks away at Public School 155, Yamzi Aquino was waiting to pick up his 8-year-old son. He was nervous about his child being back in classrooms. “I’d rather him be healthy and happy and wait,” Mr. Aquino said. “You’re risking too much.” Case numbers in schools have been significantly higher in the last three weeks than at any other moment of the pandemic. The city’s virus-tracing system for schools, known as the situation room, reported more than 13,000 positive cases among staff and students on Thursday. Still, city officials cautioned that a majority of those cases were reported during the holiday break, when children were not in school, and that they were part of an enormous backlog in case reporting. The city also started tabulating the results of rapid at-home tests, not only laboratory-confirmed P.C.R. tests, for the first time this week. In an effort to make families and educators more comfortable about returning to classrooms, the city ramped up its school testing protocol in the final week of former Mayor Bill de Blasio’s tenure. Among the changes: 1.5 million rapid at-home tests have been distributed to schools and entire classrooms no longer have to quarantine when someone tests positive. And students and staff members can return after an exposure as long as they receive two negative at-home test results over five days. Elana Rabinowitz, a middle-school teacher in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, said she was relieved to find testing kits and a KN95 mask waiting for her when she returned to her school building this week. She was assured that there would be enough of a supply to test herself twice a week. “That gave me some faith that someone was in charge,” she said. But Ms. Rabinowitz said the staff shortages that her school and many others were experiencing because of positive cases were unsustainable. On Friday, she said, about half of the staff was absent, and there were just a handful of students in most classrooms. “As usual we are wearing all the various hats to keep the school running. In a beautiful way, people have come together,” she said. “However, it’s like taking blood from a stone. All that we have been through and all that we are continuing to work with, we’re already exhausted.” Despite staffing issues in many schools, the city kept all but one of its 1,600 schools open this week. The principal of one school, Public School 58 in Brooklyn, told parents on Sunday night that she would close the school the next day, without permission from the Department of Education. It was back open by Tuesday. The city does not yet have data on employee attendance this week. During a news conference on Friday, David C. Banks, the schools chancellor, said the number of staff members in school had been “lower than we wanted to see.” He added that he expected both student and staff attendance to increase next week. But the fact that schools have been open does not mean they are operating normally. Pilar Lu-Heda, 17, a high school senior who lives in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, and who attends school in Manhattan, said her first day back was “definitely a little bit eerie” because so many students had not returned. “Usually it feels like there’s a lot of voices, a lot of people,” she said. “But today there was a lot of awkward silence because everyone could feel there was a lack of students.” Some of Pilar’s teachers have even held off on covering parts of their lessons, she said, choosing to save them for when more students return. But her teachers don’t always seem to know when that will be, she said. Pilar said that three of her close friends were recovering from the virus after contracting it over the holidays, and that she would feel safer switching to remote learning until case levels began to drop. Mr. Adams and Mr. de Blasio said last week that New Yorkers should be reassured by the fact that the city would double the size of its P.C.R. surveillance testing program in schools, randomly testing 20 percent of consenting students in each school weekly instead of 10. But that announcement now appears more aspirational than factual. This week, parents and educators said they discovered that the city was actually determining the number of students tested in a given school based on the percentage of unvaccinated students in that school — but with an expanded testing pool that included vaccinated and unvaccinated children. That means that schools with high vaccination rates are not seeing the significant increases in surveillance testing that parents and educators expected. Emily, a teacher in Manhattan who asked that her last name not be used since she was not authorized to speak publicly, said only eight students in her school of more than 300 mostly vaccinated students were tested this week — the same number as the week before break. Her experience was echoed in interviews with parents and teachers across the city. About two-thirds of families have not opted to include their children in the testing pool, prompting calls for Mr. Adams to automatically enroll all families in the program and give them the choice to opt out. Children in the city’s prekindergarten and early childhood classrooms are not eligible for vaccines or testing, which has frustrated many parents of young children. Despite changing policies, some teachers said they were grateful to be back in classrooms. Nathalie Diaz, a third-grade teacher in the South Bronx, said only one student, who had tested positive for the virus, was missing from her class this week. Her school had been closed for a few days before the break because of a spike in cases. She said parents and children seemed relieved to be back in classrooms. On Wednesday, Ms. Diaz’s class worked on a group project about the Constitution. Watching the students reading off each other’s pages, she thought about how much more challenging the exercise would be if done remotely. “It is wonderful to be back,” Ms. Diaz said. “I love that now we can kind of get back to some sort of normalcy, considering everything still going on.”"

G.M. and Ford closed one factory after another — sometimes for months on end — because of a shortage of computer chips, leaving dealer lots bare and sending car prices zooming. Yet Tesla racked up record sales quarter after quarter and ended the year having sold nearly twice as many vehicles as it did in 2020 unhindered by an industrywide crisis. Tesla’s ability to conjure up critical components has a greater significance than one year’s car sales. It suggests that the company, and possibly other young electric car businesses, could threaten the dominance of giants like Volkswagen and G.M. sooner and more forcefully than most industry executives and policymakers realize. That would help the effort to reduce the emissions that are causing climate change by displacing more gasoline-powered cars sooner. But it could hurt the millions of workers, thousands of suppliers and numerous local and national governments that rely on traditional auto production for jobs, business and tax revenue. Tesla and its enigmatic chief executive, Elon Musk, have said little about how the carmaker ran circles around the rest of the auto industry. Now it’s becoming clear that the company simply had a superior command of technology and its own supply chain. Tesla appeared to better forecast demand than businesses that produce many more cars than it does. Other automakers were surprised by how quickly the car market recovered from a steep drop early in the pandemic and had simply not ordered enough chips and parts fast enough. When Tesla couldn’t get the chips it had counted on, it took the ones that were available and rewrote the software that operated them to suit its needs. Larger auto companies couldn’t do that because they relied on outside suppliers for much of their software and computing expertise. In many cases, automakers also relied on these suppliers to deal with chip manufacturers. When the crisis hit, the automakers lacked bargaining clout. Just a few years ago, analysts saw Mr. Musk’s insistence on having Tesla do more things on its own as one of the main reasons the company was struggling to increase production. Now, his strategy appears to have been vindicated. Cars are becoming increasingly digital, defined by their software as much as their engines and transmissions. It’s a reality that some old-line car companies increasingly acknowledge. Many, including Ford and Mercedes-Benz, have said in recent months that they are hiring engineers and programmers to design their own chips and write their own software. “Tesla, born in Silicon Valley, never outsourced their software — they write their own code,” said Morris Cohen, a professor emeritus at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in manufacturing and logistics. “They rewrote the software so they could replace chips in short supply with chips not in short supply. The other carmakers were not able to do that.” “Tesla controlled its destiny,” Professor Cohen added. Tesla sold 936,000 cars globally in 2021, an 87 percent increase for the year. Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, the company formed from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, all sold fewer cars in 2021 than they did in 2020. Measured by vehicles delivered globally, Tesla vaulted past Volvo and Subaru in 2021, and some analysts predicted that it could sell two million cars this year, as factories in Berlin and Austin, Texas, come online and a plant in Shanghai ramps up production. That would put Tesla in the same league as BMW and Mercedes — something few in the industry thought possible just a couple of years ago. G.M. and Ford, of course, sell many more cars and trucks. Both companies said last week that they sold around two million vehicles last year just in the United States. Tesla, which rarely answers questions from reporters, did not respond to a request for comment for this article. It has said little publicly about how it managed to soar in a down market. “We have used alternative parts and programmed software to mitigate the challenges caused by these shortages,” the company said in its third-quarter earnings report. The performance is a stark turnaround from 2018, when Tesla’s production and supply problems made it an industry laughingstock. Many of the manufacturing snafus stemmed from Mr. Musk’s insistence that the company make many parts itself. Other car companies have realized that they need to do some of what Mr. Musk and Tesla have been doing all along and are in the process of taking control of their onboard computer systems. Mercedes, for example, plans to use fewer specialized chips in coming models and more standardized semiconductors, and to write its own software, said Markus Schäfer, a member of the German carmaker’s management board who oversees procurement. In the future, Mercedes will “make sure we have customized, standardized chips in the car,” Mr. Schäfer said in an interview on Wednesday. “Not one thousand different chips.” Mercedes will also design its own vehicle hardware, he said. Without mentioning Tesla, Mr. Schäfer added, “Probably some others were earlier going down this road.” Doing more on its own also helps explain why Tesla avoided shortages of batteries, which have limited companies like Ford and G.M. from selling lots of electric cars. In 2014, when most carmakers were still debating whether electric vehicles would ever amount to anything, Tesla broke ground on what it called a gigafactory outside Reno, Nev., to produce batteries with its partner, Panasonic. Now, that factory helps ensure a reliable supply. “It was a big risk,” said Ryan Melsert, a former Tesla executive who was involved in construction of the Nevada plant. “But because they have made decisions early on to bring things in house, they have much more control over their own fate.” As Professor Cohen of Wharton pointed out, Tesla’s approach is in many ways a throwback to the early days of the automobile, when Ford owned its own steel plants and rubber plantations. In recent decades, the conventional auto wisdom had it that manufacturers should concentrate on design and final assembly and farm out the rest to suppliers. That strategy helped reduce how much money big players tied up in factories, but left them vulnerable to supply chain turmoil. It also helps that Tesla is a much smaller company than Volkswagen and Toyota, which in a good year produce more than 10 million vehicles each. “It’s just a smaller supply chain to begin with,” said Mr. Melsert, who is now chief executive of American Battery Technology Company, a recycling and mining firm. The Tesla lineup is also more modest and easier to supply. The Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle accounted for almost all of the company’s sales in 2021. Tesla also offers fewer options than many of the traditional carmakers, which simplifies manufacturing. “It’s a more streamlined approach,” said Phil Amsrud, a senior principal analyst who specializes in automotive semiconductors at IHS Markit, a research firm. “They are not trying to manage all these different configurations.” Tesla software, which can be updated remotely, is considered the most sophisticated in the auto business. Even so, the company’s cars likely use fewer chips, analysts said, because the company controls functions like battery cooling and autonomous driving from a smaller number of centralized, onboard computers. “Tesla has fewer boxes,” Mr. Amsrud said. “The fewer the components you need right now, the better.” Of course, Tesla could still run into problems as it tries to replicate the growth it achieved in 2021 — it is aiming to increase sales about 50 percent a year for the next several years. The company acknowledged in its third-quarter report that its creative maneuvering around supply chain chaos might not work so well as it increased production and needed more chips and other parts. The electric vehicle market is also becoming much more competitive as the traditional carmakers belatedly respond with models that people want to buy rather than the small electric vehicles typically made to appease regulators. Ford said this past week that it would nearly double production of the Lightning, an electric version of its popular F-150 pickup truck, because of strong demand. Tesla’s pickup truck won’t go on sale for at least another year. The outlook for the traditional carmakers is likely to improve this year as shortages of semiconductors and other components ease, and as manufacturers get better at coping. Tesla vehicles still suffer from quality problems. The company told regulators in December that it planned to recall more than 475,000 cars for two separate defects. One could cause the rearview camera to fail, and the other could cause the front hood to open unexpectedly. And federal regulators are investigating the safety of Tesla’s Autopilot system, which can accelerate, brake and steer a car on its own. “Tesla will continue to grow,” said Stephen Beck, managing partner at cg42, a management consulting firm in New York. “But they are facing more competition than they ever have, and the competition is getting stronger.” The carmaker’s fundamental advantage, which allowed it to sail through the chip crisis, will remain, however. Tesla builds nothing but electric vehicles and is unencumbered by habits and procedures that have been rendered obsolete by new technology. “Tesla started from a clean sheet of paper,” Mr. Amsrud said."

Some were Serb-Australians and anti-vaccine campaigners, there to support Novak Djokovic, the tennis superstar who is in quarantine there as he challenges Australia’s decision to deny him entry over questions about a Covid-19 vaccine exemption. A separate group of protesters held signs proclaiming “refugees welcome” and “nine years too long.” They were drawing attention to a very different cause: the well-being of about 30 asylum seekers who have been held at the Park Hotel much longer than Mr. Djokovic, the Australian Open champion. Since December 2020, the Australian Border Force has used the hotel to house refugees who had been held for years on remote Pacific islands, under Australia’s much-criticized offshore detention policy for asylum seekers who try to reach the country by boat. Those at the Park Hotel were brought to Australia for medical treatment, but they cannot leave the hotel for any other reason, and they do not know how long they will be kept there. For activists, Mr. Djokovic’s detention at the same hotel has been an opportunity to tell the world about the asylum seekers’ plight. “The detention of Djokovic is shining a much-needed spotlight on Australia’s cruel, inhumane system of mandatory detention,” said Elaine Pearson, the Australia director for Human Rights Watch. Mr. Djokovic’s family and the government of his country, Serbia, have denounced the conditions under which they say he is being held at the Park Hotel, a no-frills, four-story facility on the outskirts of Melbourne’s central business district. His family says Mr. Djokovic has been subjected to bugs in his room and terrible food. The Serbian government has demanded better accommodations. Asylum seekers at the hotel have made similar complaints. Just after Christmas, some posted pictures of moldy and maggot-infested food they said they had received in their rooms. Earlier in December, some said that after a fire broke out at the hotel, they were confined to the lobby and not allowed outside. Several asylum seekers said the windows of their rooms had been screwed shut, denying them access to fresh air. In October and November, a coronavirus outbreak swept through their ranks. At one point, 22 of the 46 asylum seekers who were then being held at the hotel had Covid. An Australian Border Force statement said detainees in immigration hotels had “access to dedicated indoor and outdoor exercise and activity areas,” appropriate food, “clean, comfortable sleeping quarters” and other amenities. Alison Battisson, a human rights lawyer who represents some of the asylum seekers in the hotel, said Australia’s detention system was deliberately intended to “make the conditions so awful you choose to go back to the place of harm you came from.” “That’s what Mr. Djokovic has found himself in — this deterrence policy nightmare,” Ms. Battisson said. Most of the asylum seekers at the hotel were taken to Australia in 2019. They had previously been detained in offshore processing centers in the Pacific island nation of Nauru or on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, and were brought to Australia under a short-lived program for detainees who needed medical attention. They arrived desperate for a reprieve from the indefinite detention and miserable conditions they had endured, then found themselves confined to a building where they could see normal Australian life outside their windows, just beyond reach. Ms. Battisson said that if Mr. Djokovic had been treated like her clients were, he would have been handcuffed and transported to the hotel in a van with black-tinted windows. His access to vitamins and medication would be decided by the nurse on duty, if one was on duty at all. He would not be allowed access to anything that the authorities decided could be used for self-harm, she said — “for example, not even a skipping rope to help him keep fit.” And while Mr. Djokovic’s stay will be temporary, the asylum seekers locked inside have no idea how long their detention will last. “We cannot get out of the hotel,” said Mehdi Ali, a 24-year-old Iranian refugee. “We’re surrounded by walls.” Mr. Ali was young when he fled Iran, where he says he was subjected to persecution as a member of the Ahwazi Arab ethnic minority. At 15, he was among a group of asylum seekers whose boat was apprehended as they tried to reach Australia. He spent years in a string of detention centers before arriving at the Park Hotel a few months ago. He says he lost nine years of his youth to Australia’s immigration policy — waiting for rain on Nauru island so he could take a shower; participating in hunger strikes; trying to treat the rats in his room like pets. Since the news broke that Mr. Djokovic was being held at the Park Hotel, he has received a flood of messages from strangers who had just learned about his situation, Mr. Ali said. “I kind of get excited about it, that people are getting to know about our circumstance,” he said. “But I also get disappointed and I get sad, because why haven’t they known we have been in detention for more than eight years?” Shankar Kasynathan, a human rights campaigner with Amnesty International, was one of about a dozen refugee advocates who were protesting outside the hotel on Saturday morning. “It’s been nine years, and it’s too long,” he said. “We’re calling on Novak to use his influence, support base and platform to call this out and help us and help Australia bring an end to this cruelty.” He added that the protesters he was with were trying to stay separate from those demonstrating on behalf of Mr. Djokovic or against vaccine mandates. Some pro-asylum-seeker and anti-vaccine demonstrators got into a verbal confrontation that was broken up by the police. In the afternoon, an anti-vaccine protest that began in Melbourne’s central business district made its way up to the hotel. About 50 police officers surrounded 100 protesters who banged on drums, blew on whistles and chanted “Novak, Novak.” Some wore Serbian flags as capes and danced to music. Some Djokovic supporters seemed to embrace the refugee cause, at times chanting “freedom for all” as asylum seekers watched from their windows. Many Melbourne residents who stopped outside the hotel, which is on a busy tram route, said they had only just become aware that asylum seekers were being detained there. “I’ve passed this street thousands of times and never known refugees were being held here,” said Bobby Tomasevic, 55, who had dropped by hoping to catch a glimpse of Mr. Djokovic. “It’s shocking.” Before being used to detain asylum seekers, the Park Hotel — under its former name, Rydges — had been used as a Covid quarantine facility, with poor results. It was an epicenter of the second Covid wave to hit Melbourne, which led to a lengthy lockdown for the city. Australia’s offshore detention policy has been criticized at home and abroad for years. According to the Australian government’s statistics, as of September, 117 asylum seekers had been in detention for five years or more, and several for more than 10 years. That number has been declining in recent years, as dozens of refugees moved to the United States after being vetted by the American authorities, under a deal brokered during President Barack Obama’s administration. But the process has been slow, and the costs of the program have been considerable. According to the Department of Home Affairs, the hotel detention in Melbourne costs 471,493 Australian dollars per year, per detainee — or about $338,600, which amounts to more than $900 per night."

The Bahamian minister of foreign affairs, Fred Mitchell, who said he became friends with Mr. Poitier when he served as the Bahamian nonresident ambassador to Japan from 1997 to 2007, described him as a giant and a role model.  “He was a Bahamian who was able to stride across the world like a colossus,” Mr. Mitchell said in an interview on Friday. “And it is therefore possible for any other Bahamian to do that, to follow in that route, and he leaves a legacy of enormous respect and has left an indelible mark for Bahamians across the world.” Mr. Poitier, who died on Thursday night at his residence in Los Angeles at the age of 94, was the son of tomato farmers on Cat Island, a 150 square mile spindle of land with a population today of about 1,500.  The youngest of nine children, he wore clothes made from flour sacks and never saw a car until his father moved the family to Nassau in 1937 after Florida banned Bahamian tomatoes. He moved to Miami to live with a brother when he was 14, then a year later to New York City, where he started his long acting career.  Mr. Mitchell said that, like many people in the Bahamas, he grew up knowing Mr. Poitier as an Hollywood icon, watching his films at the Capitol Theater in Nassau.  “He was the son of two ordinary Bahamians from Over-the-Hill and Cat Island,” Mitchell said. “And he had extraordinary success on the world stage, on the screen, so that every movie that came out, my mother made sure that all of us, as children, were bundled up and sent to the Capitol Theatre on Market Street to see these movies.” But Mr. Poitier’s influence in the Bahamas was not limited to the big screen. He was also remembered as a driving force behind the push in 1967 to elect a parliament that reflected the nation’s Black majority in what was then a British colony. He gave logistical support to the Progressive Liberal Party under Lynden O. Pindling, the nation’s first Black prime minister, who led the Bahamas to independence in 1973, Mr. Mitchell said.  “He used his celebrity status, his connection with his friends in the United States to help promote majority rule for our country,” Mr. Mitchell said. “And he was very much a part of it, no question.” Franklyn Wilson, a former PLP cabinet minister, said Mr. Poitier wielded considerable political influence. Mr. Poitier’s house on New Providence island became the scene of Sunday afternoon political seminars in the late 1960s, where he and Mr. Pindling would discuss public policy.  “We would have these sessions at Sidney’s house on Winton Highway,” Mr. Wilson recalled. “And, by and large, Sidney was such a captivating figure that you can’t really say it was a conversation. You could describe it more accurately as lectures.” “When he started speaking, you just were in awe,” Mr. Wilson added. “And his realness just came across so clearly. The persona you saw in the world of cinematography and all that was the real man.” Mr. Wilson recalled that Mr. Poitier had once told him, “When you walk through the door of opportunity, you have one responsibility, and that is to make sure you leave the door open.” “He kicked down the door,” Mr. Wilson said. “He didn’t just leave it open. He kicked it down.” Growing up in the Bahamas, Sidney Poitier used to stare at the sky at night and wonder why the stars disappeared at dawn. That sense of wonder never left him. “My life has held an enchanting fascination with the universe,” Mr. Poitier wrote in the acknowledgments to his little-known science-fiction novel, “Montaro Caine.” Published in 2013 by Spiegel & Grau, “Montaro Caine” was a surprising detour for Mr. Poitier, but the project was in keeping with his more mystical side, his editor Cindy Spiegel said. “In a way, this novel encapsulated his entire worldview,” she said. “He talked about it as the message that he wanted to leave to his children and grandchildren, which is a message about bringing people together, people from all different backgrounds, even aliens in this case.” A fable of sorts about humanity’s future, the novel centers on Montaro Caine, the chief executive of a mining company, who is presented with a mysterious coin that was discovered in the hand of a newborn baby girl and is composed of metals that don’t exist on earth. The coin matches one that Caine has seen before, and it sets off a frenzy among scientists, corporations and collectors seeking to exploit its value. The mystery deepens when Caine learns that the design on the coin matches a pattern hanging on the wall of a medicine man’s hut on a Caribbean island. When Ms. Spiegel got the novel on submission, she was delighted by its wild premise and was determined to publish it, even though in its early form, it was “kind of a mess.” “He’s not a novelist, obviously; he had never written a novel, and this was extremely ambitious,” she said. “The plot is a bit outlandish, but it’s so compassionate and filled with authenticity and imagination and reach, and it’s not confined to the typical genre requirements of the novel,” she added. “It’s just where his imagination took him.” President Biden paid tribute to Sidney Poitier on Friday evening, remembering him as a “once-in-a-generation actor and advocate” whose work “changed the world on and off the big screen.” In a statement, Mr. Biden called Mr. Poitier “one of the finest actors in our history” — and went further. Pointing to his performances in films such as “The Defiant Ones,” “A Raisin in the Sun,” “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” and “In the Heat of the Night,” Mr. Biden said that Mr. Poitier had “held a mirror up to America’s racial attitudes in the 1950s and 1960s.” “With unflinching grandeur and poise — his singular warmth, depth and stature onscreen — Sidney helped open the hearts of millions and changed the way America saw itself,” Mr. Biden said in the statement. Citing Mr. Poitier’s working-class roots, Mr. Biden said the actor had “blazed a path for our nation to follow, and a legacy that touches every part of our society today.” “Jill and I send our love and prayers to Sidney’s wife, Joanna, his daughters, and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren,” Mr. Biden said. “May God bless Sidney Poitier.” Tributes to and memories of Sidney Poitier poured in to the comment section of his obituary in The New York Times. Some readers recalled meeting the actor, including in the Bahamas, where he spent part of his childhood. Others recalled the effect his movies had on their lives. Here are a few of the highlights. (Some comments have been edited for length.) Do you have a memory of Mr. Poitier? Join the conversation here. Sidney Poitier’s choices — onscreen and off — helped shape a rich civil rights legacy. While he spent much of his childhood in the Bahamas, where Black residents held positions of power and for the most part he was not exposed to racism, his teenage years in Miami, in the 1940s, revealed a very different portrait of Black life in America. “He was outdone by what life was like here in the South during that time,” said Evalina Bestman, Mr. Poitier’s cousin. “We had many conversations where he talked about the worth of human beings. He believed deeply in equality.” Indeed, it was in Miami, he said in a 1999 interview with The Associated Press, where he “learned quite quickly that there were places I couldn’t go, that I would be questioned if I wandered into various neighborhoods.” As an actor, Mr. Poitier broke barriers with roles that challenged social norms, turning down parts he found offensive or stereotypical. Those decisions emphasized “the power of visibility,” said Marc H. Morial, president and chief executive of the National Urban League. “He was one of the first that spoke out for racial justice at a time when it was risky, when he had a following of both Black and white audiences,” Mr. Morial said of Mr. Poitier. “If you think about the time period, it took a lot of courage to be a champion of civil rights.” Offscreen, Mr. Poitier supported the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He also participated in the March on Washington in 1963, at which Dr. Martin Luther King delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech. A few years later, Dr. King later called Mr. Poitier “a man of great depth, a man of great social concern,” who was “dedicated to human rights and freedom.” In the early 1960s, the fellow actor and his close friend Harry Belafonte recruited Mr. Poitier to drive with him to Mississippi to deliver $70,000 for Freedom Summer volunteers. While there, they were chased by Klansmen, who fired guns at them. The harrowing experience only further strengthened his resolve to fight racial injustice. “He didn’t brag about the work he was doing,” Ms. Bestman, 80, said of her cousin. “But it was clear that the civil rights movement was truly important to him.” His vision of equality meant seeing all aspects of his humanity. “You sit here and ask me such one-dimensional questions … about the ‘Negro-ness’ of my life,” he said in a 1967 news conference. “I am an artist, man, American, contemporary,” he continued, and “so I wish you would pay me the respect due.” Louis Gossett Jr., the veteran 85-year-old stage and screen actor who starred in the original 1959 Broadway production and subsequent film of Lorraine Hansberry’s “A Raisin in the Sun” alongside Sidney Poitier, is succinct. “If there was no Sidney Poitier,” he said from his Atlanta home on Friday, “there’d be no Louis Gossett Jr.” Poitier won ecstatic reviews for his starring turn on Broadway as Walter Lee Younger, a Black chauffeur bursting with big dreams on the South Side of Chicago. “Mr. Poitier is a remarkable actor with enormous power that is always under control,” Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times. “He is as eloquent when he has nothing to say as when he has a pungent line to speak. He can convey devious processes of thought as graphically as he can clown and dance.” Critics were just as enthusiastic about the 1961 film: The Times’s Bosley Crowther wrote that Poitier is “lithe and electric” and “emits the lightning of an angry, violent man who dreams of smashing the chains of his economic enslavement with a little money into which the family has come.” In a phone conversation, Gossett reflected on the lessons Poitier taught him on the set of “A Raisin in the Sun”; adventures from their Broadway days; and the lasting impact of a man he considered family. These are edited excerpts. The 1961 adaptation of “A Raisin in the Sun” was your film debut. What do you remember about the experience? It was very exciting. It was educational with all those great actors in it — Sidney, Ruby Dee, Claudia McNeil, Diana Sands, Ivan Dixon — that was royalty. You and Poitier had both starred in the Broadway production that won critical acclaim in 1959. What advice did he give you about translating that success to film? He didn’t know it, but he taught me some wonderful cinematic tricks about staying on the screen, instead of the editor going somewhere else. You learn that as you learn acting in front of a camera. So now it’s instinctual to make love for the cameraman and the editor and the director and the writer. What was the reception of the film like? I was pleasantly surprised. It was a tricky part of history, so it was a pleasure and a blessing to be part of that success. And it led to more success. People from that cast — Ivan Dixon, Ruby Dee — we all made it because of the leg up we got from “A Raisin in the Sun.” What was he like when the cameras were off? He was a very charismatic young man. Very brilliant. He grew up on Cat Island, and going from there, where it was majority Black people, to America, where it was majority white folks, was an adjustment that he had to make. It was very hard getting rid of his accent. He was up on the rooftops of buildings where he would study the newscasts so he could talk. Do you have any memorable stories from your Broadway days? I remember that we played poker on Saturday night between shows, and he owes me $75. You think I’ll get it? [Laughs]. He had a full house with 10s and I had a full house with jacks. And I remember going to lunch after the Wednesday and Saturday matinees. Me and Ivan Dixon and Robert Hooks, who was the understudy, had to do like a football plan. One person would run out and go left toward Times Square, and the other one would run out and go right toward Eighth Avenue, and half the fans that were waiting to see him would follow those two, and then when it was really narrow, Sidney would run out and go into the hotel and come out the other side and go into Downey’s, which was a famous restaurant. And he’d get a proper lunch and dinner without being bombarded with fans. He was very hot. I can see it, just knowing how crazy New York is nowadays. Oh, now it’s worse. It was a lot of fun. It was a great learning period from [the theater director] Lloyd Richards and all of them, with Sidney as the king. What’s the most important thing he taught you? The most important thing I took from him is the art of acting in front of a camera or in front of people. I had the talent, and I had the good studies in the class, but with him, it became an art. Every time he did it onstage or in a movie, it was like the first time. It was very difficult for me not to copy him. It forced me into going originally to my talent God gave me. What does he mean to you? Him and his wife are family. I call him once a month to check in. We wound up in the same places, him doing one thing and me doing another in the same cities. If he was around, I’d have to go see him. We had a good time. A great time. I loved him a lot. Late in his career, Sidney Poitier found a space on television for the kind of inspirational performances that had marked his decades in film. In the 1991 mini-series “Separate but Equal,” he played Thurgood Marshall, challenging school segregation in the Brown v. Board of Education case; the Times critic John J. O’Connor called his performance “simply splendid.” The last of his great roles was as the anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela in the 1997 Showtime film “Mandela and de Klerk,” opposite Michael Caine as F.W. de Klerk, the South African president who released Mandela from prison and negotiated the end of apartheid with him. (It was a reunion for Mr. Poitier and Mr. Caine, who had worked together in the apartheid-themed thriller “The Wilby Conspiracy” in 1975.) The film, which is available to rent on Amazon, is a typically dutiful, straightforward cable historical drama. But it’s elevated by Mr. Poitier’s complex performance, which synthesizes Mandela the icon and Mandela the man. His Mandela is wily, steely, patient and quick-witted, but careful with every word. Even as a prisoner, he can turn the slightest straw into a political lever. Maybe one reason for the performance’s potency is the resonance between actor and character. Mr. Mandela, the film points out, was seen as a terrorist by the white government yet also wrestled with more militant factions of his own party, much as Mr. Poitier himself took flak for the straight-arrow characters with which he helped integrate Hollywood. Mr. Mandela pursued a revolution from confinement, much as Mr. Poitier changed the movies despite the strictures on his roles. And Mr. Mandela, according to a story shared by the actor Will Smith in 2007, was influenced by Mr. Poitier himself, having watched “In the Heat of the Night” while imprisoned. After later learning that the South African prison authorities had censored the scene in which Mr. Poitier’s character slaps a white man, Mr. Mandela was heartened by “the idea that American movies were putting out that type of imagery,” which meant that “the possibility of change is real and obtainable.” Mr. Poitier’s most intriguing TV role, however, was one he never took: He was offered the role of president in NBC’s “The West Wing” that ultimately went to Martin Sheen. It’s tantalizing to wonder how the series might have been different had a late-career Mr. Poitier played a Black president, nearly a decade before Barack Obama. Though it remains true, fictional presidency or no, that Sidney Poitier led America from the screen. In an instant, Sidney Poitier moved America into the age of Black Power. The year, 1967. The movie, “In the Heat of the Night.” In the scene, the debonair Virgil Tibbs (Poitier), a Black homicide detective from Philadelphia, now in Sparta, Miss., is questioning Endicott (Larry Gates), a wealthy white plantation owner, about a murder. Angered, Endicott slaps him. Empowered, Tibbs slaps him back. My family referred to it as “the slap heard around the world.” Mr. Poitier has said that he insisted the slap back be added to the script. For a generation of African Americans, like my mother, who came of age during the civil rights movement, Virgil Tibbs was a revelation. He was practicing self-defense, while the movement leaders championed nonviolence. He channeled Black rage in an era of racial forgiveness. And as played by Mr. Poitier, Tibbs was so dignified and charismatic onscreen — the embodiment of Black excellence — that stereotypes about Black inferiority, often used by men like Endicott to justify segregation in the real world, appeared completely absurd and antiquated. Just as important, Mr. Poitier modeled a new image of Black masculinity — controlled, defiant, intellectual — that helped liberate the next generation of African Americans. Sidney Poitier made history in 1964 as the first Black performer to win an Oscar in the best-actor category, for Ralph Nelson’s comedy-drama “Lilies of the Field,” in which Mr. Poitier played Homer Smith, an itinerant worker who helps a group of nuns build a chapel in rural Arizona. “Because it is a long journey to this moment, I am naturally indebted to countless numbers of people,” he said in his acceptance speech, in which he thanked the creative team behind the film, his agent, and the members of the Academy. “For all of them, all I can say is a very special thank you.” Anne Bancroft, who had won the best actress Oscar in 1963 for her role as Anne Sullivan in “The Miracle Worker,” presented Mr. Poitier with the award. He was competing against Albert Finney (“Tom Jones”), Richard Harris (“This Sporting Life”), Rex Harrison (“Cleopatra”) and Paul Newman (“Hud”). When Mr. Poitier accepted an honorary Academy Award in 2002, he took a similar tack, thanking the “handful of visionary American filmmakers, directors, writers and producers” he said made his career possible by going against the odds. “Without them, this most memorable moment would not have come to pass and the many excellent young actors who have followed in admirable fashion might not have come as they have to enrich the tradition of American filmmaking as they have,” Mr. Poitier said. The elegance, the poise, the steely spine — but, oh, the face — when I think of Sidney Poitier, I first think of how beautiful he was and the sheer physical perfection of the man. He had the kind of old-fashioned Hollywood beauty and glamour that made the movies and made audiences dream and desire, turning them into repeat customers. There was much more to Poitier, yes, and he will be rightly remembered as a towering figure in the civil rights movement, one that has always been fought on the screen and not only in the streets and courts. But we should also honor and be grateful for his beauty, what it meant and what it did. Physical beauty has its obvious attractions, but it can be a powerful weapon, too. That’s one reason Jim Crow Hollywood had such profound difficulty with Black beauty, which threatened the racist order that the industry upheld, reproduced and eagerly helped legitimize for its audiences. It’s also why Walter White, the head of the N.A.A.C.P., said in the 1940s that Lena Horne would be an “interesting weapon” against Hollywood racism. The industry ignored and marginalized Black performers, relegating them to the margins of the frame, where they often wore servant costumes and spoke in insulting dialect if they even said anything. Sometimes their names weren’t in the credits; at times their musical numbers were edited out. The most instructive racist tell is that the industry’s self-censoring Production Code banned sexual relations between Black and white performers — not all people of color, just Black. Hollywood banned what the Code called miscegenation until 1957. At that point, Poitier had been acting in movies for a decade. He had made some intriguing films, and his name was being featured more prominently in the advertising. The next year, though, he catapulted to another level with the release of “The Defiant Ones,” about two escaped prisoners who are chained together and, while on the run, grow to care for each other. Directed by Stanley Kramer, it is a prime example of liberal white Hollywood at its most sincere and self-congratulatory. However hokey, exasperating and contradictory “The Defiant Ones” is, there is also no denying the charms and charisma of its two very handsome and exceedingly fit leads. Poitier wasn’t thrilled when Tony Curtis, who was trying to escape his pretty-boy image, was cast as the other prisoner. But it was apparently Curtis who asked that the two men share top billing, even though contractually only Curtis had that privilege. This immeasurably elevated Poitier’s stature, as did the movie’s great box-office success, making him a bona fide star. I have to think that the jaw-dropping lollapalooza of a poster for “The Defiant Ones” also had something to do with both its success and Poitier’s transformation into a matinee idol. The poster is drawn and vaguely reminiscent of the work of the painter George Bellows with a touch of Tom of Finland. It shows two heavily muscled prisoners facing each other while still chained, snarling and bare-chested. The two figures don’t look much like the performers that they’re meant to represent; instead, they look like bodybuilders who, after mainlining steroids to bulk up, have lost their minds and found themselves in scalding water. The poster emphasizes their antagonism, which may have appealed to some high-minded American audiences. Mostly and unambiguously, the poster was doing what film posters often did: It was selling sex through two semi-naked hotties who were definitely going to get down somehow. This was different from the grotesquely racist images of brutish Black masculinity that the movies had historically trafficked in à la “The Birth of a Nation.” Here were two men, Black and white, chained together and forced into a fateful union. In the poster the Poitier figure is positioned slightly higher than the Curtis one and has one hand on the chain, as if to pull the other man closer. This gesture may have been another white liberal appeal, but in one sense it also represents Poitier’s historic position as a crossover star, someone who could take up equal space onscreen alongside white performers, including in friendships, as in the lovely “Paris Blues” (1961), in which his and Paul Newman’s jazz musicians share a palpably warm camaraderie. In time, Poitier was also cast as the romantic lead alongside white actresses, though it was complicated. In “A Patch of Blue” (1965), his character becomes involved with a blind woman, and in “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” (1967), he plays a caricature of perfection who gently rocks the world of his young white fiancée’s parents. Hollywood had understood and profited from Poitier’s magnetism, and it wanted to continue to exploit it yet also wanted him restrained, polite, sexless. It couldn’t deal with his full humanity. One of the few times that he’d played a rounded character, one who was desiring and desirable was in “Paris Blues,” in which his character has a romance with Diahann Carroll. (The story originally featured an interracial affair.) In 1967, The New York Times published a profile of Poitier with the headline “He Doesn’t Want to Be Sexless Sidney.” It’s a sobering, tough read. He’d found success, certainly, but he was frustrated, noting that he’d never worked onscreen in a “man-woman relationship that was not symbolic.” He wasn’t interested in “a romantic interlude” with a white woman. He wanted to work with Black actresses. He wanted to put Black women on a pedestal. He wanted to give his daughters “a sense of self” and “the concept of beauty” that TV commercials didn’t provide them. He wanted to make the movies he wanted to make. From then on, he said, “I will continue to be a hero, but I won’t be a neuter,” a purposeful, profound declaration of independence. Two years later, Poitier founded his own production company, First Artists, with Newman and Barbra Streisand. In 1972, he made his directorial debut with the western “Buck and the Preacher,” in which he played a former Union soldier, Buck, who leads Black wagon trains from Louisiana to Kansas. Ruby Dee played his wife, and Harry Belafonte was Preacher. Together they ride and rob and fight to shepherd Black families to safety. It’s a wonderful, loose, galvanizing film, the start of a directing career that included hits like “Uptown Saturday Night” and “Let’s Do It Again.” He made the movies he had sought to make. In his 1967 interview, he said that “I have not made my peace with the times — they are still out of kilter — but I have made my peace with myself.” The times remained out of kilter, even as Poitier kept rising above them. HOLLYWOOD, Fla. — The Bahamian diaspora remembered the actor Sidney Poitier on Friday as a son of their soil, among the island’s greatest ambassadors. Mr. Poitier was born in Miami — home to generations of Bahamians — but he spent part of his childhood in the Bahamas. His dual roots helped to cultivate a deep following in both South Florida and the Caribbean country, which renamed the bridge to Paradise Island after the actor about 10 years ago as part of the island’s 40th anniversary of its independence. “He was larger than life in our community, especially for an island as small as the Bahamas,” said Dewey Knight, 57, whose grandparents moved from the Bahamas to the United States in the 1930s. “We saw him as the standard-bearer. What made him so special is he took pride in the Bahamas and contributed to the island.” Mr. Knight said he met Mr. Poitier in the elevator of a Miami building in the 1970s, when Mr. Knight was a child. “We saw him as our own and a representative for both the Bahamas and the larger African diaspora,” Mr. Knight continued. “When you talk about the Bahamas, you talk about three things: the beautiful beaches, conch and our Sidney Poitier.” Andy Ingraham, who was born in the Bahamas and raised in South Florida, said he was struck by how “warm and accessible” Mr. Poitier was in person. He was a child when he first met Mr. Poitier on the island, he said, and several years ago, he attended an intimate birthday dinner in Los Angeles celebrating Mr. Poitier. “His conversation was so inviting and supportive,” said Mr. Ingraham, president and C.E.O. of the National Association of Black Hotel Owners, Operators and Developers. “He never shied away from his Bahamian story, always sharing. His message was however small your beginnings, you can make it to a world stage.” Harry Belafonte, a longtime friend and constant collaborator with Sidney Poitier, remembered him on Friday as a “brother and partner” who worked with him to try to improve the world. “For over 80 years, Sidney and I laughed, cried and made as much mischief as we could,” Mr. Belafonte said in a statement. “He was truly my brother and partner in trying to make this world a little better. He certainly made mine a whole lot better.” Denzel Washington has shared many words of admiration and praise for Sidney Poitier over the decades, and on Friday, he offered some words of remembrance. “It was a privilege to call Sidney Poitier my friend,” he said in a statement. “He was a gentle man and opened doors for all of us that had been closed for years. God bless him and his family.” They first met in 1977 when Mr. Washington, just out of college and new to Los Angeles, spotted the legendary actor in a bookstore on Wilshire Boulevard, Washington recalled while presenting Mr. Poitier with an American Film Institute Life Achievement Award in 1992. “Sidney Poitier, literally the man of my dreams,” he remembered thinking. “He meant everything to me,” Mr. Washington, now a two-time Oscar winner, told the audience. “He was a positive example of elegance and good taste. He was a source of pride for millions of African Americans. He was a great movie star that was appreciated by millions of people around the world.” That day in ’77, Mr. Poitier took time to speak to a young aspiring actor, Mr. Washington added: “He was very patient with me. He was very kind to me.” In 2002, Mr. Washington presented Mr. Poitier with an honorary Oscar for his body of work. “Before Sidney, African American actors had to take supporting roles in major studio films, that were easy to cut out in certain parts of the country,” he said. “But you couldn’t cut Sidney Poitier out of a Sidney Poitier picture. He was the reason a movie got made — the first solo, above the title, African American movie star. He was unique.” Former President Barack Obama, who awarded Sidney Poitier with the Presidential Medal of Freedom during his first term in office, honored the actor on Friday, praising what he said was Mr. Poitier’s “singular talent” and ability to reveal “the power of movies to bring us closer together.” Mr. Obama awarded the medal — the highest civilian honor a president can bestow — to Mr. Poitier in a 2009 ceremony in the East Room of the White House during which he exchanged a poignant hug with the actor. “Through his groundbreaking roles and singular talent, Sidney Poitier epitomized dignity and grace, revealing the power of movies to bring us closer together,” Mr. Obama said in a tweet Friday afternoon. “He also opened doors for a generation of actors. Michelle and I send our love to his family and legion of fans.” The actress Kerry Washington thanked Sidney Poitier on Friday, writing that the actor had opened the door for others like her. “We lost an elegant King today,” she wrote in a tweet. “Thank you Sidney Poitier. For not only opening the door, but for walking in this world with endless grace and excellence, so that today, still, we follow behind you, reaching toward the example that you set.”"

A heightened risk of diabetes has already been seen among adults who recovered from Covid, according to some studies. Researchers in Europe have reported an increase in the number of children being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes since the pandemic started.  But the C.D.C. study is among the first to examine large insurance claim databases in the United States to estimate the prevalence of new diabetes diagnoses in children under age 18 who had Covid or were known to be infected with the coronavirus.  The study used two claim databases from U.S. health plans to look at diabetes diagnoses made in youngsters under 18 over the course of a year or more, starting in March 1, 2020, comparing those who had Covid with those who did not.  The researchers found increases in diabetes in both data sets, though the relative rates were quite different: they found a 2.6-fold increase in new diabetes cases among children in one, and a smaller 30 percent increase in another. “Even a 30 percent increase is a big increase in risk,” said Sharon Saydah, a researcher at the C.D.C. and lead author of the study. The differences likely result from different ways of classifying children as having Covid, she added.  Dr. Saydah said it was not yet clear whether post-Covid Type 2 diabetes would be a chronic condition in these children, or a transient condition that resolves. (Type 1 diabetes is not reversible.) Most of the children were only followed about four and a half months. The finding underscores the importance of vaccinating all eligible children against Covid, she added, and using measures like masking and distancing, especially to protect the youngest, who cannot yet be vaccinated. “It’s really important for clinicians, pediatricians and parents to be aware of the signs and symptoms of diabetes, so they can get their kids diagnosed,” Dr. Saydah said. Increased thirst, frequent urination, unintentional weight loss and fatigue are among the telltale symptoms. She noted that weight gain and sedentary behavior, which have increased during the pandemic, are also risk factors for Type 2 diabetes. Many of the children in the study were only diagnosed after having an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening complication that occurs when the body doesn’t have enough insulin to allow blood sugar into cells to use for energy. Dr. Saydah and her colleagues did not distinguish between types of diabetes, including both Type 1 and Type 2 in their analysis. The increases were seen both among those who had been ill with Covid, and those who were asymptomatic but tested positive. Another study, also released on Friday by the C.D.C., found that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protected hospitalized youngsters between the ages of 12 and 18 against severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C, which can develop two to six weeks after infection with the virus.  The study looked at 24 hospitals in 20 states between July and Dec. 9, 2021, during the period when the Delta variant was dominant. It concluded that vaccination had an efficacy rate of 91 percent against MIS-C, and noted that among 38 hospitalized patients aged 12 to 18 who required life support, all were unvaccinated."

In late October, when the weather turned unseasonably warm, I called Ruth Willig to ask her to lunch. Ruth was almost 98, in an assisted living building in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, so when she didn’t pick up for a few days, I worried. Finally, she answered and said that someone at her building had tested positive for the coronavirus, so everyone was under lockdown for at least two weeks. Lunch, alas, was not possible. It was to be a very difficult autumn. Ruth Willig — retired microbiologist, mother of four, self-described “feisty old lady” — was the last survivor among six older adults I started writing about in 2015, in a Times series about people age 85 and over, one of the fastest-growing age groups in America. I planned to follow them for a year and then move on — one of many assumptions that proved wildly wrong. The youngest of them, Fred Jones, a World War II veteran with a flashy wardrobe and an amorous mind, was the first to die, in April 2016; he was 89. The oldest, the filmmaker and writer Jonas Mekas, died in January 2019. He would have turned 100 this year. Ruth took each loss harder than the last, even as she felt some accomplishment in being the last one standing. And she kept on. Since the start of the Times series, she had become a great-grandmother, made a new best friend, saw two of her children retire and declared an end to summer vacations at the Jersey Shore with her daughters. Her life after 85, like the others’, had its share of setbacks, but she was not defined by them. Her Christmas cactuses were the envy of anyone lacking abundant sunlight. Soon after our abandoned lunch date, she struggled to breathe and was rushed to Coney Island Hospital, where she stayed for 10 days, receiving treatment for congestive heart failure and a raging urinary tract infection. From her hospital bed, she said she was determined to hang on until her birthday, Nov. 11, but did not think she would make it until the end of the year. She was right on both counts. She died in her home on Christmas Eve, waiting for the moment her two daughters left the room. Journalism tends to look away from people at the end of life, especially at the undramatic end of a long life. Very old people are rarely winning pro sports titles or running governments or businesses, setting consumer trends or even following them. Aging may be an ordinary bodily process, but like other bodily processes, it can elicit shame or embarrassment in others, maybe also fear or disgust. It’s an affront. One family in The Times series urged me not to write about their mother’s physical decline, saying they wanted to preserve her dignity — a common sentiment. Rare is the leader like Jimmy Carter, who has let the public see him through the various changes of late old age. He’s 97, born a year later than Ruth. For those who make it to old old age, there remains the challenge: How do you make a full and meaningful life when you can’t do so many of the things you once did? At the end of life, what turns out to really matter, and what is just noise? For as long as I knew Ruth, she valued time with her children above all, leveraging the anticipation of the next visit to sustain her through the gaps in between. At the end, this time together was all there was. In a 24-hour span in December, she had visits from her four children and three of her four grandchildren. They looked through old photo albums together, remembering happy moments, with Ruth identifying faces in the pictures for her children. On a phone call during one family visit, she told me, “I’m blessed,” as she always did about her children’s attentions. Then she added something new: “I deserve it.” In 2015, when I started the series, I expected it to be about the ravages of old age, about the things that old age took away. What else was there to say about getting old? Ruth and the others certainly experienced those ravages. They fell in their apartments, alone, unable to get up. They forgot words that once came easily, or repeated things they’d said moments before. They became homebound or unsafe even in their own homes. Fred Jones could not change a light bulb in his apartment, so I arrived one day to find him in the semidark. All had lost people close to them, and most experienced periods of loneliness, when they struggled to find reasons to continue. On Ruth’s last hospital stay, she spent eight hours waiting for an ambulette to take her home, until finally, at midnight, her daughter got a doctor to help lift Ruth into her car and drove her home. But as often as not, their days were like that December phone call with Ruth: battered by circumstances beyond their control, yet also leavened by something that they brought to their woes — in Ruth’s case, support from her children and pride in herself. None of the six had planned for late old age, even those who had cared for spouses at the end of life. There was early old age, as depicted in the sunny brochures for retirement communities, and there was the end, but few pointers about what happens in between. Yet all had something that they wanted: In place of the long-range aspirations of younger times, which often bring anxiety, they picked pleasures within reach. Helen Moses, who found the second love of her life at the Hebrew Home in Riverdale, in the Bronx, set her heart on getting married. Fred Jones wanted to live to 110, and more proximately, to get back to church, a prime flirting ground. Ping Wong, who lived on less than $700 a month in Social Security benefits, wanted to go to Atlantic City with her family one more time. Jonas Mekas at 95 was working to finish several books and films. For Ruth, as her time got shorter, her goals became more immediate. In November, she vowed to live until her birthday, a week away; on a Friday in December, she said her goal was to survive a couple more days, until her son could visit from New Hampshire. She managed to do both. Helen had a commitment ceremony with her partner, Howie Zeimer; Ping made it to Atlantic City; Jonas completed an extraordinary amount of work, some of which will be available this year, in dozens of exhibitions planned for his centennial. John Sorensen, a gay man who desperately missed his partner of 60 years, spent most of our first year hoping to be mobile enough to attend Thanksgiving at a friend’s house. He, too, made it, and it was even better than he had imagined. It was also his last. On my final visit with John, in a Manhattan nursing home in June 2016, he complimented a nurse on her eyelashes. “I’m never going to get better,” he said. “You’re pretty anyway.” He was 92. Fred never did get back to church. In April 2016, shortly after the death of his closest daughter, he, too, was gone. Each of the six found a different balance between enjoying the satisfactions that were still accessible to them and lamenting those they had lost. Until dementia forced Ping Wong to move from her apartment, she organized her days around playing mahjong with the same four women in her building. She said, “I never think about the things I can’t reach.” Fred Jones liked to socialize and sing in a voice modeled on the jazz singer Billy Eckstine’s; Jonas Mekas had his work and the company it brought him; Helen Moses had Howie and visits from her daughter; John Sorensen never missed the Saturday Metropolitan Opera broadcasts; Ruth had her family. None expected to live forever, nor wanted to. With the exception of Fred, who feared his afterlife, they seemed to take comfort in the knowledge that their days were limited, even if their children didn’t. One of time’s virtues is that it is finite. It’s what gives days their value. Ruth often tried to prepare her children for her death. Even in middle age, they were still her children, and she was still mothering them, her daughter Judy Willig, 68, said. “She and I talked about her dying a lot,” Judy said. “She’d say, ‘I’m worried how you kids will do.’ I said, ‘Mom, we’re not kids.’” One year ago, after her 97th birthday, Ruth for the first time talked about living to 100, which she had always said did not interest her. The timing was odd, with the pandemic still uprooting every part of her life. But she said, “And if I do, we can have a party.” Seven more months passed before I could visit her, out of doors. She’d lost some weight and her speech was mushy as a result of tooth problems, but mostly she made light of the changes in her condition. Though she was upset that her son was moving to New Hampshire, she said: “I’m not going to say anything. It’s their life, and I’m not going to be here forever.” She mentioned a recent sleepless night — she’d been having a lot of them — when she started thinking about her children and her funeral. They had never made concrete plans, she said. “We went through the Do Not Resuscitate, all that stuff. But the details of the funeral, no. And then of course the money that I’m living on, maybe some of it will be left.” She stopped to laugh. “Hopefully.” She spent November in and out of the hospital, each time putting up more resistance to going there. “It forced us to think with her about what was most important to her,” Judy Willig said. The two things that mattered most to Ruth, they decided, “were seeing us and maintaining as much independence as possible.” After a seven-day stay, Ruth returned home under hospice care at the end of the month. There she made a great effort to walk but was too weak, and her blood pressure dropped precipitously. That was the Ruth her daughter would describe — putting all her energies into what was important to her, even at risk to herself. Finally, there was nothing more that she wished for. She was where she wanted to be, with the people she wanted around her. Her daughters took to sleeping on her couch and floor, not wanting to leave her — a level of care that Ruth both grumbled at and appreciated. “No more after this,” she said in early December — meaning years, I think. She added, “Why is it so hard?” So: How do you make a full and meaningful life when you can’t do so many of the things you once did? The pandemic has brought home how much this question applies to people at any age. For almost two years, no one has been able to do things they once did. We all gave up some mobility and time with people, all stopped going to places we loved and felt some degree of isolation. Everyone had to find satisfactions that were still accessible — to make lives of what they had, not what was taken away. The elders have been living in this terrain for a long time. Their answers — don’t brood about the things you can’t reach; live as if your time is limited; focus on the people you care about; enjoy the pleasures near at hand — are simple but highly useful, pillars on which to build a good life. Easy to do, hard to remember to do. To add one more, from Jonas Mekas: A month before his death, he told a friend in the hospital that he had come to accept his end. “I am preparing myself,” he told his friend, the actor Benn Northover. He said that he had been negotiating with his angels, and that they needed his help. “You mean they need your help there?” Mr. Northover asked. Jonas did not open his eyes, but smiled, Mr. Northover said. “No, no,” Jonas answered. “There is fine. It’s here that needs help. The world needs a lot of help. I will be very busy, busier than I’ve ever been.” It was a declaration that what one did mattered, and that it did not stop mattering even when all else was lost. For almost seven years, Ruth and the other elders have served as correspondents from a country that most of us have not traveled in, though many will. Their dispatches have been generous, surprising, predictable, enlightening, contradictory and occasionally full of beans, befitting what the novelist Penelope Lively, born a decade after Ruth, called “this place at which we arrive with a certain surprise — ambushed, or so it can seem.” They have been, after all, stories of loss: accepting loss, resisting it, living fully with it even while acknowledging the pain it brings. Which is to say, they have been stories of life. And as such, the stories come to an end, in this final article in a Times series that began back in the Obama administration. At the end of each year, I asked the elders if they were glad to have lived it. Did the year have value to them? Always the answer was the same, even from those, including Ruth, who had said during the year that they were ready to go, that they wished for an end sooner rather than later. Yes, they said, yes, it was worth living. I could not ask this question of Ruth this year, so her last words will have to stand as her answer. When she could no longer speak on her final day, surrounded by family, she simply kissed her daughters’ hands. But before that she turned to her nurse. “Thank you,” she said, and did not speak again."

He fled to Spain, changed his name and cut off ties with his family, creating a new life for himself, at one point working as a chef in an Italian restaurant. But last month, Italian investigators finally tracked down Mr. Gammino, 61, in a town northwest of Madrid, thanks in part to an unlikely tool: Google Maps. “They say that fortune favors the bold,” said General Nicola Altiero, deputy director of Italy’s Antimafia Investigation Department, which carried out the operation with prosecutors in Palermo, explaining how investigators used Google Maps and Street View to help them track down Mr. Gammino, a Sicilian who was on Italy’s most dangerous fugitives list. Investigators in Palermo declined to say how they had traced Mr. Gammino to Galapagar, a town near Madrid, saying that aspects of the case were still part of an ongoing inquiry. But General Altiero was more forthcoming, explaining how investigators had used the Google tools to look up a fruit and vegetable store — “El Huerto de Manu” — that they believed could have ties to the fugitive, and happened upon an image of a man standing in front of the store. The man in the image had the same size and build as Mr. Gammino, General Altiero said, and investigators noticed that the store shared the same telephone number as a nearby restaurant — “La Cocina de Manu” — that had closed some years ago. But its social media pages remained online, including one with a photograph of the restaurant’s chef standing next to a wood-burning pizza oven. Investigators applied age-progression technology to an old photo of Mr. Gammino to get a sense of what the fugitive would have looked like after 20 years, and identified the chef as the wanted man, General Altiero said. Italian investigators contacted the Spanish police unit that hunts fugitives, and on Dec. 17, Mr. Gammino was arrested while he was walking on the street. General Altiero said there had been other breaks in the two-decade investigation, but that the discovery using the Google tools had been key to the rapid arrest of Mr. Gammino. “Seeing the image on Google Maps was a bit of luck, but in any case we had other evidence that would have eventually led us to him,” General Altiero said. “Google Maps got us there faster.” Mr. Gammino first fell afoul of the law in the 1980s when he was investigated for drug trafficking. Investigators believe he was a member of a “stidda” clan based in Campobello di Licata, a town east of Agrigento, Sicily. The stidda, which means star in Sicilian, drew from the ranks of mobsters that in the 1980s began rebelling against the leaders of the Sicilian Mafia, the Cosa Nostra. A turf war between the stidda and Cosa Nostra in the 1990s left some 200 people dead, according to a statement issued by the Antimafia Investigation Department announcing Mr. Gammino’s arrest in Spain. Mr. Gammino was then arrested in 1999 on charges of murder. He was awaiting trial in Rebibbia prison in Rome when, on June 26, 2002, he is believed to have walked out the prison’s front door, taking advantage of the bustle created by film crews during the shooting of a scene for a TV series. During his years on the run, he was convicted of murder in absentia and a European arrest warrant was issued for him in 2014. A prosecutor in Palermo declined to say whether Mr. Gammino was involved in illegal activities in Spain. Mr. Gammino is expected to be extradited to Italy in the next few weeks to serve a life sentence, investigators said."

Those to be released included Jawar Mohammed, a prominent critic of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who was arrested in July 2020 during popular protests in which hundreds of demonstrators were killed. The announcement, which coincided with Orthodox Christmas, comes weeks after Mr. Abiy’s forces scored a string of battlefield victories against rebels from the country’s northern region of Tigray, and stoked rare hopes that some form of conciliation might be possible. In a statement, Mr. Abiy’s government said it would release the prisoners “to pave the way for a lasting solution to Ethiopia’s problems in a peaceful, non-violent way” through a “national dialogue.” But there was no mention of peace talks with his main enemy, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, or T.P.L.F. which was forced to retreat to its stronghold in northern Ethiopia last month. The group has said it is ready to stop fighting if Mr. Abiy meets certain conditions. Mr. Abiy has previously ruled out any negotiation with them. “I think this is purely a political maneuver by Abiy,” said Awol Allo, a senior lecturer in law at Keele University, England. “A national dialogue to solve our political problems is not the same as peace talks to end the war.” Since Mr. Abiy, the Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2019, launched a military action in Tigray in November 2020, the conflict has been marked by accusations of widespread human rights abuses, ethnic cleansing and a humanitarian crisis that has pushed at least 400,000 people into famine-like conditions. In its statement on Friday, the government said that “the key to lasting unity is dialogue.” But it also struck a triumphalist note, saying that “one of the moral obligations of a victor is mercy.” However, fighting continues in Tigray, where Mr. Abiy’s forces suffered a series of humiliating defeats last summer. Analysts and foreign diplomats say Mr. Abiy’s stunning military comeback in recent months was largely made possible by armed drones supplied by foreign allies, including the United Arab Emirates and Turkey, that turned the tide on the battlefield. For months, diplomats from the United States, Europe and neighboring African nations have urged Mr. Abiy, privately and in public, to stop fighting and open peace talks with the Tigrayans and other armed opposition groups. Last month, the Tigrayans said they were ready to enter talks if the government released political prisoners — including thousands of ethnic Tigrayans detained by the Ethiopian security forces in recent months — and ended a punishing seven-month siege of Tigray that has cut off vital supplies of food and medicine. But the government has not taken either of those steps. The list of prisoners to be released includes Sebhat Nega, an octogenarian founding member of the T.P.L.F. who was captured by Ethiopian soldiers in the early weeks of the war. But the most significant announcement was doubtless that of Mr. Jawar, a leader of the ethnic Oromo group that makes up over one-third of Ethiopia’s 110 million people, and one of Mr. Abiy’s most formidable political opponents. Mr. Abiy, then a leader of an Oromo political party, came to power in 2018 following massive street protests by Oromo youth that were led by Mr. Jawar, the founder of an influential media group and a one-time resident of the United States. But the two men later fell out, with Mr. Jawar accusing Mr. Abiy of abandoning the Oromo cause. Mr. Abiy jailed Mr. Jawar in July 2020 during the tumultuous protests that erupted following the unexplained killing of a popular Oromo singer, Hachalu Hundessa. In recent weeks, Mr. Abiy has been in quiet talks with Mr. Jawar about his possible release, two foreign diplomats said. It was unclear whether any conditions were attached to the release announced on Friday."

The image was blurry, but it was unmistakable: The object looked like a cube sitting on the moon’s surface. Its shape looked too precise to be just a moon rock — perhaps something left by visiting aliens like the monolith in Arthur C. Clarke’s “2001: A Space Odyssey.” China’s space authorities called it the “mystery hut.” Others called it the “moon cube.” Yutu-2 was sent for a closer look, and at the leisurely speed the rover is capable of traveling, it took weeks to get up close. On Friday, Our Space, a Chinese language science channel affiliated with China National Space Administration, posted an update. There is no monolith, no secret base on the rim of a lunar crater. Close up, it turns out to be just a rock. The seemingly perfect geometric shape was just a trick of angle, light and shadow. The report was earlier noted on Twitter by Andrew Jones, a journalist who follows the Chinese space program. Although the mystery hut was not a hut at all, one of the rover’s remote drivers on Earth pointed out that the rock sort of resembled a rabbit and one of the stones in front of it looked a bit like a carrot. That’s fitting as the rover’s name means “Jade Rabbit.” The rover has now driven just over 1,000 meters since it arrived three years ago on the moon’s far side, in Von Kármán crater, as part of the Chang’e-4 mission. It is the first mission to land on the far side. Visual illusions are common in the history of space exploration, whether seen by astronomers peering through telescopes on Earth or robotic explorers on other worlds capturing images with cameras. In a parallel with the rabbit-like rock found by China’s rover, a NASA rover on Mars, Opportunity, spotted something that looked like bunny ears in 2004. Further analysis by engineers on Earth suggested it was insulation or other soft material that fell off the rover itself."

Sionil Jose, the author of a dozen socially engaged novels and countless short stories and essays who was sometimes called the grand old man of Philippine letters and even the conscience of his nation, died here on Thursday. He was 97.  Mr. Jose’s family said he died at Makati Medical Center, where he had been awaiting an angioplasty operation. Passionately committed to social justice, Mr. Jose often wrote of his anguish over what he saw as his country’s failure to overcome centuries of Spanish colonization, followed by further domination by the United States. His novels, rich in themes and scenes drawn from his own peasant beginnings, amounted to a continuing morality play about the poverty and class divisions of the Philippines, a nation seemingly in thrall to fiefs, oligarchies and political dynasties. He said his heroes were “the common people, the foot soldiers who die in the hundreds so that their generals may live.” Mr. Jose wrote more than 35 books, all in English, spinning off political commentary and blog posts along the way. He was a public figure in the world of letters, traveling often to lecture and to attend writers’ conferences, and he was bursting with energy even into his 90s. He founded the Philippine chapter of PEN, the international writers’ association. He opened and ran a well-stocked bookshop in Manila, Solidaridad, which published his work and offered books and magazines that were hard to find elsewhere in the Philippines. He also published Solidarity, a monthly journal of “current affairs, ideas and the arts.” Mr. Jose collected a score of awards, grants and fellowships from abroad as well as in the Philippines, where the government named him a National Artist for Literature. His works have been translated into 28 languages. He was not shy about voicing strong opinions, as in 2018 when he criticized some of the work at the National Museum of Fine Arts in Manila. “I have lived for 93 years — some say that is already too long,” he wrote, “but for this tired old man the time has not yet come for me to be silent.” At the core of Mr. Jose’s prolific output was a set of five interconnected novels that he called the Rosales Saga, published over a span of 20 years. Beginning with “The Pretenders,” published in 1962, they chronicled the lives of poor migrant farmers, not unlike his own family, as they struggled against the oppression, land-grabbing and corruption of the country’s entrenched elite. Mr. Jose also wove in themes and characters from the works of the great Philippine nationalist writer Jose Rizal, whose novels influenced him from an early age. “Growing up, I witnessed injustice, and the ordinary Filipino can do nothing about it,” he said in a 2012 interview. “So that’s been my theme: man’s search for justice and a moral order.” For Mr. Jose, the recent history of the Philippines had been deeply discouraging. He sometimes seemed unable to contain his exasperation at his country’s failure to change its longstanding power structure. When President Corazon C. Aquino, after ousting the dictator Ferdinand Marcos in the 1980s, declined to redistribute land held by powerful families, Mr. Jose exclaimed, “Sayang!” — then, repeating the point in English, added, “What a waste!” “In a situation like this, of what use is the artist?” he said in an interview with The New York Times then. “I look back over our history and I see that the pen is not that powerful. Everything I have done has been useless. It is the sword that is powerful.” Mr. Jose’s greatest frustration as a writer, he wrote in one of his columns, was “my seeming incapacity to influence people, to see at least some visible and creative result of my pleading, my editorializing.” Francisco Sionil Jose was born on Dec. 3, 1924, in Rosales, a small town in Pangasinan, a province northeast of Manila. Rosales, which served as the setting for much of his fiction, was home to many poor farmers, like his parents, who had migrated south from the province of Ilocos Norte. He always considered himself an Ilocano and spoke that language fluently. After high school, he studied liberal arts at Santo Tomas University in Manila, where he edited the school newspaper, The Varsitarian, before dropping out to embark on a literary life. It was at Santo Tomas that he met his future wife, Maria Teresa Jovellanos, known as Tessie, when she was a 17-year-old student. She was by his side for the rest of his life, his muse, counselor and protector. Together they had seven children. She survives him, as do five of their children, Antonio, Eddie, Eugene, Nikko Jose and Evelina Jose Cichy; 11 grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren. “We were really poor,” Mr. Jose said once, recalling his childhood. “When there was no kerosene I’d go read under the lamppost until 10 p.m., when my mother would tell me to go home.” But she also encouraged him to read, going out of her way to find him books. “She made me everything I am,” he said. His reading complemented his upbringing among poor farmers, experiences that produced the dominant themes of his work. “I grew up in this village, listened to the stories of the elders about their flight from the north, the revolution against Spain,” he wrote in the introduction to “Dusk,” one of his Rosales novels. “My forebears were very nationalistic and deeply religious as well,” he continued. “Most of all I grew up with the knowledge of their suffering in the new land, their exploitation by the landlords, the eventual dispossession of their lands. I also knew of the hardiness of their spirit, the dreams they shared, and the angers that made them endure.” In a 2014 column titled “Hindsight,” published in The Philippine Star, Mr. Jose said that he wished he could write books with happy endings, “with the characters journeying to the sunset, their faces aglow with joy.” He had tried, he said, but the “bleakness and deadening gloom” of the world around him always asserted themselves. “There are so many happy events in my own life worth recalling and writing,” he said, “events that lifted my spirit and assured me God is in His heaven looking kindly on us. But the words won’t come.” Yet Mr. Jose, known to his friends as Frankie, radiated sunny good will, laughter and jokes. He loved to take visitors on the long drive up to Ilocos Norte, passing through Rosales on the way, urging companions to sample intimidating Ilocano delicacies like pinapaitan, a mix of ox tripe, small intestines, heart, bile and green chilies. (The secret: Squeeze in a little calamansi lime to cut the bitterness.) He took pleasure in sharing some of the more colorful vulgarities of the Ilocano language. Notably portly in his later years, Mr. Jose was almost totally bald and was rarely seen without his beret. Asked at a celebration of his 90th birthday to share the secret of his longevity, he said: “Simple! The good die young.” Mr. Jose enjoyed the company of young, aspiring writers, whom he sometimes gathered in his living room for informal seminars. “For art to be meaningful,” he told one such group, “it must not be just for enjoyment. It must have relevance to the times, to human beings, to serving justice.” He added, “Pure art, pure science, are good, but they must have some meaning for humanity.”"

He directed movies as if trying to bottle an ineffable essence or panache from the heydays of Orson Welles, John Ford and Howard Hawks, whose legacy he helped preserve in his first calling as a film historian. But Bogdanovich’s knowledge (and name-dropping) didn’t produce movies for a select few cinephiles. Even Francis Ford Coppola, a New Hollywood contemporary who would release “The Godfather” the next year, marveled at the rapt, packed audiences for Bogdanovich’s 1971 masterpiece “The Last Picture Show.” Writing and filming with flair, elegance, and the heart of an old romantic, Bogdanovich reimagined the storied past and played with genre, dialing up or down the noise of the plot. Having studied as an actor, he also brought a palpable affection for his stars that persisted even as his own star as a filmmaker faded after the 1970s. The joy of moviemaking, however, never left him. Here are nine highlights of Bogdanovich’s work, all available to stream. After years of interviewing the masters, Bogdanovich directed his own canonical classic, adapting Larry McMurtry’s personal novel about a small Texas town in the 1950s. Bittersweet and funny, it’s a warm portrait of folks dealing with loneliness, tedium and, frankly, horniness in a tight-knit place where there’s little to do but see a picture show. Cybill Shepherd makes her screen debut as a high schooler tiring of her roughneck boyfriend (Jeff Bridges); her disillusioned mother (a wonderfully sly Ellen Burstyn) knows a dead end when she sees one. The heart of the movie might lie with Sonny (Timothy Bottoms), a well-meaning teenager with all the direction of a tumbleweed. Well-deserved Oscars went to two more standouts, Cloris Leachman and Ben Johnson. Shot in a lovely, dusty black-and-white, the movie sighs with the lived experience of a hundred memoirs. Ryan O’Neal and Barbra Streisand face off in probably the truest screwball comedy since the days of “His Girl Friday.” A nerdy musicologist (O’Neal) bumps into a gleeful troublemaker (Streisand, pure magic) while looking for aspirin in a store. Feature-length lunacy follows. Not a line or shot is wasted as the stars expertly carry out the clockwork chaos orchestrated by Bogdanovich in a San Francisco hotel through syncopated dialogue, comic bits of business and, of course, chases. Four identical suitcases fuel the madness, creating a sensation of absolute giddiness. Born out of an assignment from the B-movie maestro Roger Corman, Bogdanovich’s ingenious and unusual directing debut taps into a late-1960s mood of upheaval and disorientation. Boris Karloff plays a retiring horror star who decides that no movie could match the fearsome violence of the real world. At the same time, a sniper is on the loose — a conceit inspired by the University of Texas tower shootings by Charles Whitman. The story lines converge at a drive-in to produce a genuine sense of shock, previewing the talents of the young director, who has a part as a filmmaker looking to cast Karloff. Ryan O’Neal plays a con man who makes quick bucks by selling Bibles to widows, and his real-life daughter, Tatum O’Neal (an Oscar winner at age 10), is the orphan who falls under his care and keeps outwitting him. A number of directors in the 1970s looked back to the Depression era, but Bogdanovich’s comedy has a mischievous verve. Shooting again in black and white, he clearly delights in Tatum’s defiant streak, and gives Madeline Kahn an immortal monologue as Trixie Delight, a dancer seeking to ensnare the con man. Ben Gazzara brings his effortless charm, amused grin and gravelly baritone to this story of an expat pimp in Singapore running into trouble. You can almost feel the film’s rhythms being given over entirely to Gazzara, as he glides through rooms and streets, saying his hellos. It’s a site-specific view on the shifting sands of expatriate existence, with cinematography by Robby Müller. It also brings to a close the freewheeling, high-flying ’70s chapter of the director’s filmmaking career, as his fortunes shifted. A fondness for country music crops up throughout Bogdanovich’s work, and it blooms here in this overlooked, warmhearted story of an aspiring singer-songwriter in Nashville. While trying to land gigs, Miranda (Samantha Mathis) finds herself living a series of country songs: pining for one singer (River Phoenix), mooned over by another (Dermot Mulroney), wondering whether to pack up and go back home. Sandra Bullock co-stars, pre-“Speed,” as Miranda’s aimless roommate. The film’s gentle story provided Phoenix with his final role before his tragic death. Bogdanovich’s other musical interests later culminated in a four-hour-plus 2007 documentary about Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. In 1924, the Hollywood producer Thomas H. Ince died under mysterious circumstances on William Randolph Hearst’s yacht, on a cruise to celebrate Ince’s birthday. The incident, which became the basis for a 1997 play by Steven Peros that he adapted for the screen, proves irresistible to Bogdanovich, who assembles a cast game for louche partying and meaningful glances. An effervescent Kirsten Dunst headlines as the actress and Hearst amour Marion Davies, with Eddie Izzard as Charlie Chaplin, Edward Herrmann as the ever-jealous Hearst, and Joanna Lumley and Jennifer Tilly to boot. Some of Bogdanovich’s greatest work was done off screen as a film historian, interviewer (see, for example, “Who the Devil Made It: Conversations with Legendary Filmmakers”) and curator, but his feature-length documentary on the great silent comedian gives a taste. Stirring clips of Buster Keaton’s work accompany admiration from fans ranging from Mel Brooks to Johnny Knoxville. In this vein it’s also worth tracking down Bogdanovich’s even better documentary “Directed by John Ford.” Bogdanovich stars in one of cinema’s great, lost works, begun in the early 1970s by Orson Welles and painstakingly reassembled in 2018. The main setting is the 70th birthday party of the raucous director Jake Hannaford (John Huston), with glimpses of a radical new film to come. Bogdanovich plays Hannaford’s young foil — fittingly, a hotshot director on the rise. The film’s cinematic phantasmagoria belongs to Welles’s legacy, but also captures Bogdanovich’s double life as filmmaker and film-chronicler."

That includes Comet Leonard, which made its closest pass to the sun on Monday and is heading away again. A team of scientists have now come up with a detailed explanation for this multi-chromatic behavior. The molecule responsible for the emerald hue gets blown apart by sunlight within a couple of days of being created near the comet’s core, leaving almost nothing to glow green in the tail. “We showed exactly how that happens in the lab by using UV lasers, measuring exactly how the molecule blows apart,” said Timothy W. Schmidt, a professor of chemistry at the University of New South Wales in Australia. As a comet — a clump of ices and dust — approaches the sun, it heats up and its ices turn to gas, producing a fuzzy atmosphere known as the coma. The atmosphere includes carbon-based molecules that are in turn bombarded with ultraviolet light from the sun, breaking it apart and stripping off outer pieces. That generates a simple but fragile molecule known as dicarbon, or C₂ in chemical notation. It is two carbon atoms bonded together. Scientists have known for the better part of a century that photons can knock dicarbon molecules into an excited state. Because of the quantum nature of the universe, an excited molecule reverts to its ground state by emitting a photon. For dicarbon, the photon is commonly one of green light. This explained the green color of comet comas. But the apparent dearth of dicarbon in the comet tails was something of a mystery. So Dr. Schmidt recreated what is happening in their laboratory. To produce dicarbon, they started with molecules consisting of two carbon atoms and four chlorine atoms and used a laser to strip off the chlorines, leaving only dicarbon. Then they used another laser to break up the dicarbon, measuring exactly how much energy that required. From that, they showed how the dicarbon molecules had to absorb two photons to be blown apart, and the lifetime of a dicarbon molecule bathed in sunlight is about 44 hours. In that time, the molecules might travel 80,000 miles or so — quite far. But comet tails can stretch millions of miles. Thus, there would be little or no dicarbon, and no green glow, there. That largely fits with what has been observed in comets. Dr. Schmidt’s team reported its findings last month in a paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “What they’re doing is the ground work that is fundamental to explaining the observations,” said Anita Cochran, assistant director of the University of Texas’s McDonald Observatory who was not involved with the research. “Understanding carbon in the universe is pretty important since it is such a common species.” William Jackson, an emeritus professor of chemistry at the University of California, Davis, lauded the work but said there was likely more to the story. He noted that a photograph of a comet included in the paper shows not only a green coma but also a slight tinge of green in the tail. “I think this is a great example of the importance of doing laboratory measurements and combining with astronomical observations, and trying to understand what you see,” Dr. Jackson said. But the bombarding sunlight likely produces additional dicarbon in the comet tails and knocks the molecules into a variety of excited states. “It’s a little too simple to say that you don’t see C₂ in the tail,” Dr. Jackson said."

A perennial Oscar nominee in the 1960s, Poitier became a movie star at a time when Hollywood tended to relegate Black actors to roles as servants, appearing for just a scene or two, often as comic relief. But he was rarely a supporting player, even at the start of his career. He took leads, specializing in a specific type: the educated, well-mannered, middle-class professional who had assimilated into the parts of white society willing to accept him. Throughout his first two decades in show business, Poitier’s films often promoted powerful messages about the ignorance of bigotry. His charisma and grace made him popular with white and Black audiences alike, and played no small part in easing some of the racial tensions in America — just by giving controversial issues an amiable advocate. These 11 Poitier movies span the ’50s to the ’90s, when he semiretired. They offer a good overview of not just the scope of his career, but of how the country changed during his 50-plus years in show business. After a relatively short stint as a New York stage actor, Poitier made an auspicious big-screen debut in 1950 with the writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s unusual hybrid of social drama and film noir. As a doctor struggling against the ingrained racism of his patients — including a career criminal played by Richard Widmark — Poitier allowed audiences to see what even accomplished Black Americans were facing every day, and how that kind of abuse could rattle a person’s psyche. In Poitier’s best 1950s film, he plays a longshoreman who becomes fast friends with a co-worker (played by John Cassavetes) who’s secretly AWOL from the military. Though one’s an upstanding citizen and the other’s a deserter, they are treated differently by their cruel boss (Jack Warden), who doesn’t like seeing any of his people getting chummy — especially not when one’s white and one’s Black. Less preachy than many of Poitier’s pictures from this era, “Edge of the City” has a bracing naturalism, born of its roots in the adventurous, progressive New York theater and television scenes. In a sublime bit of cultural kismet, the playwright Lorraine Hansberry’s masterpiece arrived when Poitier was the right age to tackle one of theater’s great characters: the pragmatic, prickly Walter Younger. Unlike the softer-edged, friendlier men Poitier had been portraying up to then, Walter doesn’t have much faith in the great dream of integration. He argues with his more idealistic family members about whether they should use a financial windfall to move into a white neighborhood, and his cynicism brings to light arguments that were being had by Black families everywhere in the ’50s and ’60s — except on the big screen. Poitier won a best actor Oscar for “Lilies of the Field” (1963), which would become the first of a short string of films (including “To Sir, With Love” from 1967 and “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner”) in which he played handy, disarming individuals, helping white people improve their attitudes. Most of these movies are more interesting now for how they reveal the subtle racism of well-meaning left-leaning filmmakers, but “A Patch of Blue” is a refreshing exception, and the first movie to watch from this batch. As a kindly soul who helps a poor, abused blind teenager stand up for herself, Poitier is saintly but grounded. And the writer-director Guy Green’s adaptation of an Elizabeth Kata novel is unusually wise about how sometimes class matters as much as race in America. In between his social-issue films, Poitier made plenty of genre pictures where race was a key element of the plot (as in the two-fisted 1958 adventure “The Defiant Ones,” and the 1966 western “Duel at Diablo”). The most popular of these is the best picture-winning “In the Heat of the Night,” in which the actor plays a brilliant Philadelphia homicide detective, Virgil Tibbs, who is drafted to help a small-town Mississippi police department crack a difficult case. Refusing to defer to his virulently prejudiced hosts, Tibbs carries himself as a truly free man, in ways that audiences back in 1967 found thrilling. He’d go on to play the character twice more: in “They Call Me Mister Tibbs!” (1970) and “The Organization” (1971). The critical reputation of this Oscar-winning blockbuster hit has diminished in recent years. It’s been held up as an example of Hollywood’s heavy-handed social messaging — rather than as a groundbreaking interrogation of some purportedly open-minded white and Black families’ conflicted feelings about interracial marriage. Nevertheless, Poitier gave one of his most memorable performances in the film, using his charisma and wit to peck away at the underlying prejudices of the older generation, represented here primarily by characters played by the venerable movie stars Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. The points that the director-producer Stanley Kramer and the screenwriter William Rose are making may be blunt, but Poitier delivers them in electrifying fashion. After acting in films almost nonstop throughout the ’50s and ’60s, Poitier slowed his output from the mid-70s onward, in part because he began working more behind the camera. He made his directorial debut in 1972 with this offbeat western, which arrived toward the start of the blaxploitation era, when the movie industry began to realize the commercial potential of films about self-actualized Black protagonists. Joined by Harry Belafonte and Ruby Dee, a frequent co-star, Poitier cast himself in “Buck and the Preacher” as a skilled scout having lightly comic adventures on the frontier. While attuned to 19th-century racial strife, this film is more an amiable entertainment than a hard-hitting commentary. As such, it has held up better than some of the star’s more incendiary projects. Many of the Black-themed films that filled American theaters in the ’70s were raunchy and R-rated, but Poitier had hits in that era with three PG caper comedies, which he directed and starred in alongside Bill Cosby and a host of A-list African American entertainers. The first in this loose trilogy was “Uptown Saturday Night,” with Poitier and Cosby playing buddies who go on an all-night odyssey through their neighborhood — encountering colorful characters played by the likes of Belafonte, Flip Wilson and Richard Pryor — while searching for a stolen lottery ticket. One of Poitier’s first feature films was a 1951 adaptation of Alan Paton’s best seller, “Cry, the Beloved Country,” an unusually forward-thinking exposé of the horrors of South African apartheid. Poitier returned to that theme 24 years later with “The Wilby Conspiracy,” a chase thriller in which he plays a revolutionary on the run from the authorities with a sympathetic white buddy (played by Michael Caine). Though essentially an action picture, the movie does a fine job of making injustice come alive. Poitier and Caine would later team up again for the 1997 TV movie “Mandela and de Klerk,” dramatizing apartheid’s last days. Poitier made some baffling professional choices during the ’80s and ’90s, when he rarely acted, and directed more than his share of duds. But it’s hard to fault him for joining Robert Redford, Dan Aykroyd, David Strathairn and River Phoenix for the ensemble adventure-comedy “Sneakers.” As a former C.I.A. agent aiding a team of well-meaning super-hackers, Poitier makes good use of his iconic screen presence, representing one of the last sparks of ’60s idealism in an increasingly synthetic age. One of Poitier’s last screen performances was in this 1999 TV movie, in which he plays an intensely private, self-sufficient, elderly Georgian whose mental competency is questioned when he refuses to sell his land. Noah Dearborn is the kind of character Poitier played throughout his career — skilled, stubborn and deeply decent — but it says something about how the culture changed during his lifetime that his race is no longer the defining element in his story. That’s a direct consequence of how Poitier spent his career defying stereotypes and fighting to bring layered Black individuals to the screen."

The former deputy, Aaron Russell, 25, was originally charged with second-degree murder in the killing of Nicholas Bils, who was running from officers near a downtown San Diego jail after escaping from a park ranger’s car in May 2020. Mr. Bils, 36, was mentally ill and had a lifelong fear of the police, a lawyer for his family has said. The plea reflects that Mr. Russell “erroneously and unreasonably believed it was necessary to defend against a perceived imminent threat,” Summer Stephan, the San Diego County district attorney, said in a statement. Mr. Russell will face a maximum possible sentence of 11 years in prison when he is sentenced on Feb. 7, Ms. Stephan said. Ms. Stephan said that her office had met with Kathleen Bils, Mr. Bils’s mother, about the plea arrangement and that her input was critical. “Nothing will bring back this family’s loved one,” Ms. Stephan said, “but we hope this conviction will bring them a measure of justice and accountability.” Phone and email messages left on Friday for Eugene Iredale, a lawyer who has represented Ms. Bils, were not immediately returned. A lawyer for Mr. Russell also could not immediately be reached. Mr. Russell was the first law enforcement officer in California to be charged with murder since the state raised the standard for when police can use deadly force, Ms. Stephan said. Starting in January 2020, the standard for using deadly force was no longer when it was “reasonable” but instead only when it was “necessary” to prevent imminent danger to life. Mr. Bils was putting golf balls at a San Diego park on May 1, 2020, in a game of fetch with his dog when park rangers approached him and told him that his dog could not be off its leash and that the park was closed because of the coronavirus, Mr. Iredale has said. Park rangers told Ms. Bils that her son had swung a golf club at rangers and then fled, her lawyers said. The rangers caught him about a mile away and arrested him on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. On the way to a county jail, Mr. Bils slipped his left hand out of a handcuff and ran out of the car, prosecutors said. Mr. Russell, who was in uniform, was standing at a nearby intersection and saw the escape, prosecutors said, adding that he fired five shots, striking Mr. Bils four times. Another sheriff’s deputy who had witnessed the escape testified that he had planned to chase and tackle Mr. Bils, the district attorney’s statement said. “He testified he saw no need for any type of other force and did not feel anyone in the area was in immediate danger,” the statement said. Mr. Bils’s killing came weeks before George Floyd was murdered under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, setting off a wave of protests against police killings and brutality."

On Friday, the Biden administration announced that 665,000 households had received aid through the Emergency Rental Assistance Program in November, the most ever for any month, bringing the total distributed or planned to be spent to between $25 billion and $30 billion, according to the Treasury Department. But that success means that several states, including New York, Texas and Oregon, have already used up nearly their entire share of federal funding from the program. And the new numbers underscore the reality that the federal government’s largest-ever attempt to prevent evictions was never intended to be a long-term solution. Funds for struggling renters will soon disappear unless Congress renews funding, which is highly unlikely. “There is tremendous uncertainty now, especially for renters,” said Vincent Reina, a professor of urban planning at the University of Pennsylvania who has helped design aid programs in Philadelphia. “Historically, we have had a nonexistent housing safety net nationally. Then we suddenly have this allocation of resources, and we build this whole new infrastructure. Now it’s about to go away, and we have no idea if it will ever be rebuilt.” Those who have already received rental assistance can keep it. But renters who want to file for the first time or reapply may be out of luck. Many states had expected a major boon this month, as the Treasury Department shifted $1.1 billion from states that had been slow in distributing funds. Instead, the White House pressed Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Louisiana and other states to voluntarily shift about $875 million to cities and counties in their states that needed the money most. As a result, a relatively small amount of funding was available to states that had requested more. New York, for example, requested a billion dollars in added funding but stands to receive only $27 million, or 3 percent of what it asked for. John Mitchell used rental assistance to remain in his Philadelphia apartment when he fell behind on rent, after losing his job as a restaurant server because of pandemic closures. But now, with the surge of the Omicron variant, he is back in the same position. The restaurant where he works closed after a staff member tested positive for the coronavirus. Mr. Mitchell got sick, too, and now he is behind on rent again while he looks for a new job and cares for his mother, who is struggling with health issues. “This has just been hell,” he said. Landlords are facing uncertainty, too. “This program is a lifeline — it’s how we right the ship, if we will, on housing during the pandemic,” said Greg Brown, senior vice president of governmental affairs at the National Apartment Association. Owners who cannot receive additional rental assistance will be left with mounting debts, he said. “There clearly is more need than there were dollars allocated.” For months, emergency rental assistance dollars sat largely unspent, with states and cities struggling to set up programs to distribute the funds, and tenants and landlords bogged down with cumbersome application requirements. Through July, just $5.1 billion of the $46.5 billion had been distributed. But as the White House and the Treasury Department, which oversees the program, put pressure on states to spend the funds or else see them used by other states, the pace sharply quickened. One of the major levers the government used was to warn laggard states that their funding would be shifted to other states if they did not quickly improve their distribution and anti-eviction efforts. By the fall, with the federal eviction moratorium expired, many states had improved their efforts, and administration officials began offering governors an out: They could move their money to counties and cities that were spending the cash more efficiently, said Gene Sperling, an economic adviser to President Biden who oversees the program for the White House. Arizona officials agreed to shift $39 million to the state’s largest county, Maricopa, while Georgia moved about $50 million from its allocation to Fulton and DeKalb Counties in the Atlanta area. The biggest single shift took place in Wisconsin, where Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, agreed to move about $110 million to county and city officials in Milwaukee, according to the Treasury Department. That left only about $240 million in cash to be shifted from states — including Vermont, Idaho, Delaware and South Dakota — that were not spending their cash fast enough. “That is disappointing to states and cities who hoped to have a large amount of additional funds reallocated to them, but it reflects the larger, positive reality that after the initial challenges, these funds are now being spent or committed to families in need at a much more accelerated pace,” Mr. Sperling said. For example, Texas requested $3 billion from the Treasury in the reallocation process, according to Michael Lyttle, a spokesman for the Department of Housing and Community Affairs. The state will not receive additional funds, but several Texas cities and counties will receive around $19 million total. “This is the only life vest,” said Dana Karni, manager of the Eviction Right to Counsel Project in Houston. “If we don’t have emergency rental assistance, there’s not a whole lot we can do.” The city of Houston and Harris County have just under $10 million left in their local emergency rental assistance coffers after distributing more than $270 million. The state stopped accepting new applications in November, after requests exceeded available funds. For months, the assistance funds helped keep people housed, even as local eviction filings have climbed back up toward prepandemic averages, Ms. Karni said. The rental assistance funds, in combination with local eviction protections in some places, have been effective at preventing a surge of evictions that many feared would come on the heels of the end of the federal eviction moratorium in August. The number of new filings nationally remains below prepandemic levels, according to Princeton’s Eviction Lab, which collects data from housing courts around the country. But tenants fear that the loss of the aid, and the lapsing of local anti-eviction protections put into place during the pandemic, will eventually lead to a rise in evictions. For Robin Millard, rental assistance was the difference between staying in her home and possible homelessness. After her roommate lost construction work because of Covid, the two fell behind on rent for the Houston apartment Ms. Millard also shares with her 11-year-old daughter. Ms. Millard had costly medical bills to pay for her own cancer treatment, too, and her disability checks were not enough to cover it all. The assistance changed her life, she said. “I know that I definitely would have been homeless with my daughter, which is a terrifying thought because we’ve never been unstable in our lives,” Ms. Millard said. “It’s scary to think that that isn’t going to be available anymore, because where else are people going to turn to?” she said. Landlords and tenants in some places continue to be frustrated by monthslong wait times to actually receive the funds. “Rental assistance has just been a botched mess in Philadelphia from our side of things,” said Kevin Moyer, a property manager in the city. He said that delays in rental assistance funds had led his clients to move forward with evicting tenants rather than wait for payments. “People are still being evicted,” said Myriam Ramirez, an organizer in Philadelphia with Make the Road PA. Some tenants have struggled with filling out the complicated application, and others have faced delays because their landlords failed to complete their portion. “They call me every day: ‘What do we do? Who do we call?’” Ms. Ramirez said. The sudden exhaustion of rental assistance funds also casts uncertainty on the future of new eviction prevention programs that dozens of city and states used rental assistance money to fund. Some jurisdictions established eviction diversion programs to provide mediation during landlord-tenant disputes. Others created programs that provided tenants with legal representation in eviction proceedings. But without rental assistance funds, the effectiveness of these programs is limited. In Texas, courts will be required to allow legal representation for tenants at least until March thanks to an order from the State Supreme Court. But without financial relief for renters, Ms. Karni said, lawyers have limited impact."

Once you get used to the buzzer and the cadence of the clues, she explained in a recent interview, you have a significant advantage over a candidate who comes in cold. And Schneider has certainly settled into her groove. On Friday, she became the fourth contestant and the first woman in the history of “Jeopardy!” to surpass $1 million in winnings during regular-season play. She did so on her 28th game, a runaway in which she won over $42,000, continuing a streak that has captured the attention of game-show fans across the country. “It’s not a sum of money I ever anticipated would be associated with my name,” Schneider, a 42-year-old software engineering manager who lives in Oakland, Calif., said in a news release. Schneider, who grew up watching “Jeopardy!” at home with her parents and in eighth grade was voted most likely to appear on the show, has had a whirlwind of a week — for good reasons and bad. On Monday, she tweeted that she had been robbed, losing her credit cards, identification and phone. (As a result, she said she would need to pause her detailed recaps of each game on social media). The $1 million mark is a rare one to reach — Ken Jennings was the first player to do so, in 2004, 30 games into his record 74-game run. But fans have gotten increasingly used to seeing contestants achieve it. James Holzhauer became the second person to hit $1 million during his 32-game streak in 2019. Three months ago, Matt Amodio surpassed $1 million as well, amassing $1.5 million before he was beat after 38 wins. The recent pattern of streaks on the show has fueled theorizing among fans watching from their couches and among members of the show’s production team. Some have postulated that pandemic-related delays in production have benefited some contestants by giving them more time to study. Some point to the increasingly vast amount of resources online. Or, it could just be chance. “To some extent, I think it’s just got to be a statistical fluke,” Schneider said. Schneider is doubtful that the extra time she had to prepare during the pandemic helped her significantly. Ultimately, she said, it’s not something you can cram for. “To be good at ‘Jeopardy!’,” she said, “you just have to live a life where you’re learning stuff all the time.”"

In a scene reminiscent of spring 2020, patient beds have been set up in the hallway. But on Wednesday, when Interfaith asked city officials to divert ambulances to other hospitals, the request was granted for only two hours, the hospital’s top executive said. Emergency rooms at neighboring hospitals were also overflowing, or precariously understaffed. “All hospitals, not just safety net hospitals, in Brooklyn and in other boroughs are stressed,” the executive, LaRay Brown, said. Ms. Brown is the chief executive at One Brooklyn Health, which runs Interfaith and nearby Brookdale Hospital. As the Omicron variant of the coronavirus sweeps through New York, many hospitals are being pushed to their limits by twin challenges: spiking numbers of virus cases and growing shortages of nurses, doctors and technicians. Many workers are sick with Covid-19; others who quit amid the pandemic have not been replaced. While the latest virus wave appears to be less deadly than earlier ones, with many fewer patients on ventilators, even large hospitals with empty intensive care beds are straining to handle the surge in caseloads because so many workers are out, health care officials said. “I think everyone across the region is struggling,” said John D’Angelo, who oversees the emergency departments at Northwell Health, the state’s largest health system. Because of its own staff shortages, Northwell has had to limit the number of patients it can take from Interfaith and other beleaguered hospitals. Almost 4,000 Northwell employees, or 5 percent, were out as a result of Covid-19 on Thursday, Dr. D’Angelo said. That was about double the number at the height of the first virus wave. The system can transfer employees between hospitals as needed, but its emergency rooms have been operating at up to twice their normal volume and waiting times are up. Dr. D’Angelo likened the daily effort to keep positions filled to a game of “whac-a-mole.” For smaller community hospitals with fewer resources, the situation is more critical. At Interfaith and Brookdale and their affiliated nursing homes, 471 out of 7,000 staff members were out with Covid-19 this week, forcing some nurses to handle double the usual number of patients, Ms. Brown said. “It is challenging for the hospitals, but it is particularly stressful for our safety net institutions,” said Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group. “A number of them have requested assistance, including staffing assistance from the state. The problem is the cupboard is bare.” Similar situations are playing out around the country, including in New Jersey, where officials are working with the federal government and the National Guard to deploy medical teams to hospitals that are experiencing severe staff shortages. Nationally, the number of people hospitalized with the virus reached 116,000 this week, the most in a year. But a significant number who have tested positive for Covid-19 — anywhere from 20 to 65 percent — were admitted for other reasons and are not primarily ill with virus symptoms, according to hospital officials in many states. In interviews, nurses and doctors in New York described scenes of distress, including one of a patient urinating in a trash can because she could not get help, and others involving nurses forced to work entire shifts without a break. Scheena Iyande Tannis, a critical care nurse at Brookdale, said that she and her colleagues had covered additional shifts, “working in waves, as each person is waiting for their turn to get sick.” Still, things seemed better to her than they were in the first virus surge. “The first time we were just totally decimated,” Ms. Tannis said. “This time, we are overwhelmed but not destroyed.” New York City is served by a complex ecosystem of about 50 hospitals. The best known are major academic hospitals with imposing Manhattan flagships like NewYork-Presybterian/Weill Cornell and NYU Langone Medical Center. Then there is the safety-net system, the core of which are the 11 public hospitals run by the city. Augmenting that are about a dozen smaller, independent hospitals that are in working-class neighborhoods outside Manhattan, rely mostly on Medicaid and have been among those hit hardest by the pandemic. The enormous inequity in the city’s hospitals became clear when the pandemic descended on New York in spring 2020. Safety net hospitals like Brookdale were overwhelmed with patients, but had smaller staffs, worse equipment and less access to drug trials and advanced treatments than their better-financed counterparts. Dr. Dave A. Chokshi, the city’s health commissioner, said on Thursday that about 80 percent of the hospital beds in the five boroughs were occupied this week, as the number of patients with Covid-19 reached nearly 6,000. That was about half the peak in the first wave, when ballparks and conference centers were turned into field hospitals. But Dr. Chokshi and hospital executives said the numbers did not tell the full story, as the number of Covid-19 cases continue to climb and because some hospitals do not have enough employees to open all their beds. Isolation requirements for virus patients also mean some beds cannot be used. “This is why it is so vital for us to surge resources and support to our health care system, particularly to our safety net and H and H hospitals,” Dr. Chokshi said, referring to those run by the city’s hospitals agency. To that end, the city has expanded a loan guarantee program to help hospitals pay for increased staffing while the Omicron wave persists. Michael Del Valle, a resident physician at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, one of the city-run hospitals, and a vice president of the union that represents residents, said the emergency room there was so crowded that patients had just a foot or two of space between them. “If you’re in a stretcher, you can touch the person next to you by putting your hand out,” he said. Dr. Del Valle, who tested positive for the virus this week, estimated that more than 25 percent of Jacobi’s emergency room residents had done the same in recent weeks. With so many patients arriving and so many staff members out sick, it often takes longer than usual for medicine to be administered, he said. Long waits for admission and care have led to angry confrontations. “There has certainly been an uptick in verbal aggression and physical aggression,” Dr. Del Valle said, adding that Jacobi had added security officers in the emergency room. Seeking to address the inequities exposed by the pandemic, state officials in December 2020 instituted a system called load balancing for when patient numbers reach critical proportions and hospitals must seek help from one another. In recent days, Dr. D’Angelo of Northwell said, his system had accepted about a dozen transfer patients from overwhelmed safety net hospitals, including Jamaica Hospital in Queens, an independent hospital where, state data shows, the intensive care unit is full, and the city-run Queens Hospital Center. Northwell has also agreed to send nurses to Brookdale and Interfaith. Ms. Brown said she was grateful, but that the hospitals needed many more reinforcements. The loan guarantee program, which Mayor Eric Adams announced on Wednesday, might help pay for expensive travel nurses to fill some of the gaps, she said. Agencies, she added, were now charging up to $215 an hour for critical care nurses. “We’ll take everything we can get — as my mother would say, beggars can’t be choosers,” said Ms. Brown. One Brooklyn Health and other hospital systems have also sought help from state officials. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who declared a health care emergency in late November, has authorized nursing students and out-of-state doctors to assist during the current surge. The state has also deployed 120 National Guard members to nursing homes and had directed federal teams to upstate hospitals experiencing their own crises. The state has not sent staff reinforcements to downstate hospitals, Mr. Raske said. Jill Montag, a spokeswoman for the state Health Department, did not dispute that, but she said the state was helping hospitals coordinate their efforts and had secured 50 ambulance teams for New York City from the Federal Emergency Management Agency; 25 are to arrive on Saturday. The problem has been compounded for community hospitals by the way the Omicron wave has spread, starting in wealthier parts of Manhattan and then moving to low-income neighborhoods that rely on safety net hospitals. This week, the Covid positivity rates topped 40 percent in the South Bronx and parts of Brooklyn and Queens. About 37,000 new cases a day are being reported citywide on average. Longstanding health care disparities mean patients in poor areas are also arriving at hospitals with more pre-existing conditions, and vaccination rates in these areas tend to be lower, contributing to more severe illness. In the Brooklyn ZIP code where Brookdale is, about 2,500 people tested positive for the virus last week, with a positivity rate of 43 percent. Not all safety net hospitals say they are being stretched to the limit. The area around St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx had nearly the highest test positivity rate in the city this week, above 46 percent. But officials said they were dealing with the higher volume, even with 7 to 9 percent of the work force out with Covid-19 or caring for sick relatives. Not all of the hospital’s intensive care bed are full, and of the 30 patients presently in intensive care at St. Barnabas, only 10 have Covid-19, said Dr. Edward Telzak, the chief of internal medicine. “Covid-19 is not overwhelming us,” he added. It is different at the pediatric emergency room at Montefiore Hospital, a major nonprofit hospital in the Bronx. Julian Grant, a registered nurse, said the small emergency room was often packed with up to 80 patients, with as few as two nurses to help them. More children, she said, were coming in now complaining of difficulty breathing now than had during previous virus waves, although they were usually well enough to be sent home after being given steroids and other treatments. Whether or not they have Covid-19, all of the patients must wait together, raising the specter of the virus spreading to vulnerable children. “Things have gotten terrible,” she said. “At the end of the day as nurses, it really doesn’t feel good when you can’t take care of your patients.”"

Mr. Mandal is so excited about the healing promise of a jab that he says he has received 12 coronavirus vaccine doses — so far. How, you may ask? Mr. Mandal, an 85-year-old retired postman from the northern Indian state of Bihar, is happy to share. He said he received his first dose on Feb. 13 at a local clinic, and he hasn’t stopped since. He has recorded the date and location of each jab in a pocket notebook. His ninth shot, he said, was on Sept. 24 at 12:32 p.m. at a hospital in Kalashan, Madhepura District. “I felt that it was helping my general health,” he said in a phone interview. “My backache has improved, my general weakness improved, and my appetite improved.” “I was always looking for new vaccine camps and would go there,” Mr. Mandal said. “Nobody would recognize me.” Dr. Amarendra Narayan Shahi, the chief medical officer in Madhepura, said he had spoken to Mr. Mandal who had told him about his quest to get more doses because he believed it cured his ailments, many of them natural at his age. “Yes, he is claiming that he got 12 doses,” Dr. Shahi said. “I have constituted a three-member investigating team to find the truth.” For nine of the 12 shots Mr. Mandal registered to receive, he said he used his national identity card and his mobile number. After that, he said, he switched to alternative forms of identification, like his voting card and the mobile numbers of his wife and his friends. Exactly how Mr. Mandal was found out is unclear, but it appeared to be a case of him boasting about his many boosters to someone who had then tipped off the local news media. Authorities in the district of Madhepura say they have also started an investigation. There is no indication that supercharging the immune system with 12 shots brings any real benefits, or would help with anything other than what the vaccine is intended to do. In fact, there is an ongoing debate on whether boosting the immune system over and over can cause it to become fatigued, or to prevent it from responding to future versions of the vaccine. Only an investigation will confirm whether Mr. Mandal received the multitude of doses that he claims. But there have certainly been many irregularities in Bihar during India’s vaccination drive — a massive undertaking with 1.5 billion doses administered so far. In September, when a remarkable 25 million doses were administered to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday, Bihar topped the list of states with about 3.4 million doses. But media reports later suggested that Bihar’s vaccination numbers were likely inaccurate — that data from offline vaccinations from previous days were intentionally withheld and uploaded on the campaign day to inflate the total. Weeks later, it also emerged that one district in Bihar had been reporting ghost vaccinations: Among those recorded as having received the vaccine in the district, but who clearly had not, were Prime Minister Modi himself, as well as some Bollywood celebrities. It is precisely the manual registration that would have come in handy in Mr. Mandal’s quest to keep getting shots before boosters were being offered — and then to keep on boosting every month or so, he said. Mr. Mandal admitted that each time he registered for a new jab, he was asked whether or not he had previously received the shot. “Every time I told them a lie — that I had not,” he said. Dr. Shahi, the district medical chief, said internet problems in Madhepura were such that in many areas vaccinations happened offline and the data was uploaded later. He said what was surprising, if Mr. Mandal’s claim turns out true, is that the portal did not detect repeat uploads when the data went online. As for Mr. Mandal, he said he would keep looking for new opportunities. “I still want more,” he said."

They were 72. Family statements sent by an agent for the brothers announced their death but did not specify the cause. A lawyer for the twins told multiple French news outlets that they had died of Covid-19. Both said in December that they were unvaccinated. The Bogdanoff brothers were perhaps best known internationally for their extensive employment of Botox, lip filler and chin sculpting in the 1990s and 2000s, which resulted in changes so extensive that they rendered them almost unrecognizable — some said almost alien. It was fitting, the jokes went, because the once conventionally looking brothers had first rocketed to fame in the late 1970s as the hosts of the otherworldly TV show “Temps X” (“Time X”). The show mixed gadgetry, science fiction and actual science — think “Mr. Wizard” crossed with “Mystery Science Theater 3000,” but weirder than the former and more earnest than the latter — with the Bogdanoffs dressed in silvery suits on a set made to look like the control deck of a spaceship. Later, they received doctoral degrees, Igor in physics and Grichka mathematics and published academic papers laying out what they claimed was an explanation for the state of the universe just before the Big Bang. But their research was soon called into question by scientists in Europe and North America, who said the work was so incomprehensible that, at least at first, they believed it was most likely a hoax by the attention-seeking twins. The brothers insisted that they were serious, and correct; they later sued several scientists and magazines for libel. That didn’t stop “L’Affaire Bogdanoff” (pronounced BOG-dan-off) from becoming a roast, even as it raised difficult questions about the peer-review process and whether theoretical physics had become so abstruse that it was difficult to tell real work from nonsense. To many in the scientific community, they were con men. But the French public did not seem to care: Their book “Before the Big Bang” (2004), which encapsulated their research for a general audience, was a swift seller in France, and they hosted two more TV shows in the late 2000s. And at least someone thought their work was worthy. In the mid-2000s they worked as professors of cosmology at Megatrend University, a private institution in Belgrade, Serbia, that has been accused of operating as a diploma mill. By then their facial transmogrifications were largely complete and, though often mocked as comically repulsive, they continued to mix with elite French society, dating models and heiresses and making the rounds during gala season. The brothers denied ever undergoing cosmetic surgery, insisting instead that their changes resulted from their dabbling in unspecified “technologies.” Then, in a final act that seems both fitting and inevitable given the times in which we live, the brothers became a crypto meme. Their virality, which began around 2015, was not entirely random. The Bogdanoffs claimed to have helped write the source code for Bitcoin, and said that its legendary, perhaps fictional inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, had given them a pair of “ancient” bitcoins “in physical form.” The meme depicts Grichka as a sort of crypto puppet master, dumping or pumping the markets to thwart a hapless, nameless investor. Whether or not the brothers got the humor, they seemed keen to play along, recently suggesting that they were planning to launch their own cryptocurrency. Igor Yourievitch Bogdanoff and Grégoire Yourievitch Bogdanoff, who sometimes spelled their surname Bogdanov, were born on Aug. 29, 1949, in a castle in the town of Saint-Lary-Soulan, a ski resort nestled in the French Pyrenees along the Spanish border. Their father, Youri Ostasenko-Bogdanoff, was an itinerant painter who said he was descended from a Tatar prince and who had fled Russia as a boy. They were raised by their maternal grandmother, Bertha Kolowrat-Krakowska, an erstwhile Bohemian countess who had lost her title after having an affair with Roland Hayes, an American opera singer who was touring in France and who was the first Black man to win international fame as a concert performer. Their daughter, Maria Dolores Franzyska Kolowrat-Krakowska, was the twins’ mother. Igor’s first marriage, to the Belgian aristocrat Ludmila d’Oultremont, ended in divorce. He married Amélie de Bourbon-Parme, a model and descendant of Louis XIV, in 2009 in a star-studded ceremony at the Château de Chambord in the Loire Valley. They separated in 2016 and later divorced. The brothers are survived by their half brother, François Davant, and their sisters, Laurence, Géraldine and Véronique Bogdanoff. Igor is also survived by a son, Dmitri, whom he had with the actress Geneviève Grad; his daughters, Sasha and Anna-Claria, and his son Wenceslas, all from his first marriage; and his sons Alexandre and Constantin, from his second marriage. The Bogdanoffs claimed to be geniuses from an early age, saying they had each scored 190 on childhood I.Q. tests. They studied applied mathematics from the Paris Institute of Political Studies, also known as Sciences Po, and studied at the École Pratique des Hautes Études. After “Temps X” ended in 1987, the Bogdanoffs wrote “Dieu et La Science” (1991), about the relationship between religion and science. It was a best seller in France, but it drew a lawsuit by Trinh Xuan Thuan, an astrophysicist at the University of Virginia, who claimed they had plagiarized one of his books. The brothers settled out of court in 1995, having in the meantime begun their graduate studies. They said they were motivated by their interest in the so-called initial singularity, the moment before the Big Bang, when all matter, space and time were condensed into an infinitely dense point. Others, however, suspected that they were trying to raise their intellectual prestige during the lawsuit, and at least one scientist, John Barrow of the University of Cambridge, said they had approached him about how to get a doctoral degree quickly. The brothers began their studies at the University of Bordeaux before transferring to the University of Burgundy. Their adviser, Daniel Sternheimer, told The New York Times in 2002 that while the Bogdanoffs were exceptionally intelligent, they were often “impressionistic” in their research. Still, he said, he signed off on their theses. “These guys worked for 10 years without pay,” he said. “They have the right to have their work recognized with a diploma, which is nothing much these days.” It was rough going; Grichka was denied a physics doctorate, though he got a degree in mathematics from Burgundy in 1999, while Igor was forced to substantially revise his thesis and publish additional papers before receiving a physics degree there in 2002. They each received an “honorable” grade, the lowest and least common. That same year, rumors began to circulate among physicists and mathematicians about a pair of French celebrities who were trying to spoof the scientific establishment — a retread of a 1996 hoax by the physicist Alan Sokal, who managed to get a paper filled with nonsense into an esteemed cultural studies journal. Eventually, most agreed that no hoax was intended, just inanities masquerading as insight. The pile-on was both painful to watch and impossible to ignore, as scientists took turns dunking on the brothers. “One thing that seems pretty clear to me is that the Bogdanovs don’t know how to do physics,” John Baez, a physicist at the University of California, Riverside, told The Times in 2002. The brothers pushed back, growing increasingly litigious, especially after France’s National Center for Scientific Research opened an inquiry into their work. They successfully sued Marianne, a French magazine, for publishing portions of the center’s report, and then unsuccessfully sued the center itself when it concluded that their research was worthless. But the law cuts both ways, and in 2018 the Bogdanoffs were arrested on charges of “aggressive fraud” after they had persuaded a French millionaire to invest nearly $1 million in a series of unrealized projects, including a reboot of “Temps X.” The millionaire, whose identity was never disclosed, died by suicide in 2018. The brothers were indicted in 2020 and were preparing to go to court when they entered the emergency room on Dec. 15 with Covidlike symptoms. Ms. Bourbon-Parme told the BFMTV news channel on Wednesday that the brothers, who were several hospital rooms apart, called each other often to chat, but that doctors had already placed Igor in an artificial coma when Grishka died. Ms. Bourbon-Parme confirmed that the twins were not vaccinated against Covid-19, but she said their decision had been personal, not political. “They were both 72, they were in great shape, and they thought they were untouchable,” she said, adding that they had always been reluctant to face their own mortality. Death, she said, “was a taboo topic for them, and at the same time it fascinated them.”"

Those on both sides of the bargaining said they were pleased that the standoff had ended. “It has been a really, really long road,” said Lilian Coie, 27, a doctoral student in neurobiology and a member of the bargaining committee for Student Workers of Columbia, which represents about 3,000 graduate and undergraduate students. “Even though the agreement isn’t perfect, we’re very happy with it.” With the tentative contract agreement in hand, union representatives said that about a third of their members had voted on whether to end the strike and that more than 90 percent of those who voted supported doing so. A formal vote to ratify the contract, which runs for four years, is set for later this month. In a statement, Mary C. Boyce, Columbia’s provost, said “there is no doubt that this has been a challenging period for the university.” Still, she added, “all who were involved in collective bargaining shared the common goal of creating a stronger Columbia for those who teach and learn, conduct research, discover and innovate, work and study here.” “I am optimistic that when the new academic term begins on Jan. 18, Columbia will fully return to the normal rhythm of academic life,” she said. The Columbia strike was the latest such action at a prominent U.S. university. Student workers at New York University agreed to a contract after striking in the spring. At Harvard University, a three-day strike ended in late October and a second strike was narrowly avoided the following month after a tentative agreement was reached. Tensions at Columbia ran high at times during the negotiations. In early December, university officials sent an email to student workers saying that those who did not return to work within a few days would not be guaranteed jobs for the spring semester. The workers responded by blocking campus entrances for a day. Among other things, the tentative contract includes a 6 percent raise for workers with annual contracts and an increase in hourly wages to $21 from $15. Columbia has also agreed to cover 75 percent of the cost of student workers’ dental insurance and to create a $300,000 emergency fund that workers can tap for out-of-pocket medical expenses. The fund is scheduled to grow in future years. The agreement also allows student workers, after the university investigates, to seek third-party arbitration in cases involving allegations of discrimination, harassment or both. That would give workers the opportunity to hire investigators or lawyers not affiliated with Columbia to evaluate complaints. The recent strike was the second such action by student workers at Columbia. The first, last spring, ended without a contract and with all of the union’s bargaining committee members stepping down. “I think there were a lot of people who felt that when we were campaigning for the no vote last spring, we were leading people off a cliff,” Ms. Coie said. “But we actually made some really, really big improvements on the last tentative agreement.” Several city officials applauded the agreement. “Student workers are the backbone of Columbia University,” Mark Levine, the Manhattan borough president, said in a statement. “And I’m relieved the union and the university have finally reached a tentative agreement that fairly compensates students for their teaching, research and operational expertise.” Over the next three weeks, union leaders will contact as many union members as possible to make sure they understand the agreement’s terms before the ratification vote is held. “What our members achieved is impressive,” said Nadeem Mansour, 32, a humanities doctoral student and bargaining committee member, “but this is only the start.”"

On Thursday, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors in Phoenix delivered a detailed four-hour livestreamed rebuttal of all the firm’s claims, showing that all, except one involving 50 votes, were either mistaken, misleading or outright false. That same day, a superior court judge cited the company for contempt after it refused to surrender records of its vote review to The Arizona Republic, which is seeking them under a freedom of information request. He levied a $50,000-a-day fine on the firm until it produces the records. By week’s end, lawyers said the firm was insolvent and had laid off its employees, including Doug Logan, its chief executive and onetime proponent of a baseless theory that the state’s voting machines had been rigged. The shutdown was confirmed on Friday by a spokesman, Rod Thomson, who said it was unclear whether the company would declare bankruptcy. That did not impress the judge, John Hannah, who suggested that the shutdown might be designed “to leave the Cyber Ninjas entity as an empty piñata for all of us to swing at.” The official Maricopa County Twitter account seized on the description, declaring that “an empty piñata is a pretty accurate description of the ‘audit’ as a whole.” But whether the exercise was a complete failure is another matter. Experts say it played a role in accomplishing a more fundamental political goal: fueling anger over the accuracy and integrity of the 2020 election among former President Donald J. Trump’s most ardent backers. The six-month, $5.6 million review of the 2.1 million votes cast in Arizona’s largest county was ordered up last year by the Republican-controlled State Senate after supporters of Mr. Trump insisted that his narrow loss in the state was the result of fraud. It became something of a national punchline in September after the review concluded that President Biden actually won by a greater margin than official tallies showed. Still, the review and its supporters insisted that the election was suspect, citing 75 potential irregularities they said the Cyber Ninjas were unable to resolve. The rebuttal by the five-member Board of Supervisors, four of them Republicans, was striking both for its detail and its bluntness. A 93-page printed version said that a review of the Cyber Ninjas’ claims of irregularities found only 37 potentially questionable ballots among the 53,304 that had been labeled suspect. Those were referred to the state attorney general, a Republican who has been asked to review the organization’s claims. Out of the 75 claims of irregularities, the county said, the only one that could be valid involved 50 ballots that may have been double-counted. That error would not have affected the outcome of any race in the November 2020 election, the county said. The county supervisors had denounced the Senate’s review for months as partisan theatrics aimed at mollifying the substantial far-right share of the state’s Republican voters. But the board’s chairman, Bill Gates, a Republican, went further on Thursday, drawing a straight line between tolerance for “extreme misinformation” and political violence like the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Referring to protesters who stormed the building, Mr. Gates said that “many of these people did it because they believed they were saving their country from an election that they had been told had been stolen.” “Many people in positions of power, they fed into this, for they simply turned a blind eye,” he added. “They’ve listened to the loud few and told them what they want to hear, and that’s the easy thing to do. But here, we don’t do what’s easy. We do what’s right.” Right or not, some say, the county’s demolition of the Maricopa County review is unlikely to change much. In the view of some experts, the review’s findings were less important to its supporters than the simple fact that it was being conducted. “It’s entirely a Republican base motivator,” Chuck Coughlin, a Phoenix pollster, campaign consultant and onetime transition director for former Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, said in an interview. Almost all of the state’s Democrats, a solid majority of independents and a fifth of Republicans dismissed the review from the start, he said — but for the remaining Republicans, it has been political catnip. “These fake reviews were never designed to identify problems,” said David Becker, the executive director of the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation and Research. “They are designed to be part of a long con” that whips up voter outrage for personal and political profit. Karen Fann, a Republican and the State Senate president, said in a statement on Thursday that the goal of the review was “identifying and implementing improvements in our election process,” and that Maricopa County had “finally” admitted it erred. “Maricopa County took an important first step with us yesterday,” she stated, “and we look forward to their cooperation to improve voter confidence in our elections going forward.” The near-total debunking of the election review by the county went unmentioned. Others said Ms. Fann would face steep hurdles to achieve that goal. In Wisconsin, Texas and other states, Republicans have insisted that audits of 2020 election results were needed to restore flagging faith in elections. But on Thursday, an ABC News/Ipsos poll concluded that 20 percent of Americans were “very confident” in the nation’s ability to hold honest elections — and that Republicans, at 13 percent, had far less faith than either Democrats or independents. Paul Boyer, who was virtually alone among Republicans in the State Senate in criticizing the election review, laid that at the feet of Mr. Trump and other Republicans who have spread bogus claims of voter fraud or remained silent instead of refuting them. “That may lead to bigger rallies for the former president, but less turnout where it counts — at the ballot box,” he said. “We’ll do well in 2022,” given dissatisfaction with Mr. Biden, he added. “But long term, we’re in deep trouble.”"

The increase was observed in children who were 4 and younger, who are not eligible for vaccination, and the data included children who were admitted to hospitals for reasons other than Covid. The rise may be partly explained by the surge of Omicron cases, which affects all populations, and the spread of other respiratory infections. But the data do not show a similar steep rise in coronavirus infections among hospitalized children of other ages, and federal health officials were considering the possibility that Omicron may not be as mild in young children as it is older children. Children infected with the variant are still at much less risk of becoming severely ill compared with adults, and even young children seem less likely to need ventilators than those admitted during previous surges, doctors said. “We have not yet seen a signal that there is any increased severity in this age demographic,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C.’s director, told reporters at a news briefing on Friday. More than four in 100,000 children ages 4 and younger admitted to hospitals were infected with the coronavirus as of Jan. 1 — double the rate reported a month ago and about three times the rate this time last year. By contrast, the rate of hospitalized 5- to 11-year-olds with Covid was 0.6 per 100,000, roughly the same figure reported over past many months. Dr. Walensky noted that only 16 percent of children from 5 to 11 had been fully vaccinated, and she urged everyone who was eligible for vaccines and boosters to receive them as soon as possible. “Sadly, we are seeing the rates of hospitalizations increasing for children 0 to 4, who are not yet currently eligible for Covid-19 vaccination,” she said. “It’s critically important that we surround them with people who are vaccinated to provide them protection.” The rise has been noticeable at a number of regional medical centers. The hospitalizations of young children now are “blowing away our previous Delta wave at the end of the summer, early fall, which had been our highest prior to that,” said Dr. Danielle Zerr, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Seattle Children’s Hospital. Experts are typically cautious about interpreting an increase in pediatric hospitalizations as a sign that a variant is particularly severe in children relative to adults. There were similar fears about the Delta and Beta variants, but the rise in pediatric hospitalizations then turned out to be more a consequence of the contagiousness of the variants. This time, too, at least part of the increase in cases is a reflection of Omicron’s surge across all age groups. The nation is now recording roughly 600,000 cases on average per day, about one in five of them in children. “The more kids that get infected, the more you’re going to have kids who are going to be sick enough to be hospitalized,” said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, chair of the committee on infectious diseases at the American Academy of Pediatrics and a physician at Stanford University. At Seattle Children’s Hospital, for example, about 21 percent of children are testing positive for the coronavirus, compared with the average of about 1 percent and a high during the Delta wave of about 3 percent. “That is just a game changer,” Dr. Zerr said of the more recent figures. Doctors may be quicker to admit a young child than an adult with similar symptoms, and that may account for some of the rising rates in young children. But some experts said the increase this time might be too steep to be explained only by the usual factors. One alternative hypothesis for the rise may be that young children are particularly vulnerable to infections in the upper airway — exactly where Omicron is thought to be more concentrated in comparison with other variants. “They’re smaller, their airways are smaller,” Dr. Kristin Oliver, a pediatrician at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said of young children. “It does seem reasonable in a disease that if it looks like it’s affecting the upper airway more, that they would be more impacted,” she added. “They are more at risk for that — for longer, prolonged cases, as well as the hospitalization that can come along with a more severe case.” That may explain why more hospitalized children aged 4 and younger have tested positive for the coronavirus throughout the pandemic than those 5 and older. It’s also why young children are more vulnerable to other pathogens, like respiratory syncytial virus, and to having the seal-like cough associated with croup. For parents of young children, the numbers add another layer of worry as they wait for vaccines to become available. Alicia Henriquez, a public-school teacher in Chicago, has three children, two of them younger than 5. Her younger children — Maxi, 4 and Sofia, 2 — are both infected with the coronavirus, but Maxi has no symptoms at all, and Sofia has only a cough. Still, Ms. Henriquez said she was monitoring their symptoms carefully. “You don’t know if your child is going to end up in the hospital or not, so I think you still have to be careful,” she said. The C.D.C.’s new data were collected by Covid-Net, the agency’s hospitalization surveillance network, which includes 14 sites and covers about 10 percent of the U.S. population. The rates are likely to be underestimates because of the lack of availability of tests, according to the agency. Many children who become severely ill have other conditions or have weak immune systems. “Those kids are definitely at high risk right now,” Dr. Maldonado said. “We’re seeing more of them now than we were before.” Dr. Julie Binder, a gastroenterologist in Philadelphia, has two daughters under 5. Her older daughter, Annie, 4, has an undiagnosed medical condition that results in “some very bizarre reactions” to viruses, Dr. Binder said. After a viral infection landed Annie in the hospital two years ago, she had complications for months. Dr. Binder and her husband have been adamant about maintaining as normal a life for Annie as possible, even during the pandemic. But they have kept her home from day care the past couple of weeks to shield her from the post-holiday spike in infections. “Hearing this information, I’m certainly glad that I did,” Dr. Binder said of the data released on Friday. “I would have felt much more comfortable through this wave right now if she had been vaccinated.” A coronavirus vaccine is not yet available in the United States to children under 5, and is unlikely to be for a few more months. But many older children are also still unvaccinated. Fewer than 25 percent of children from 5 to 11, and just over 60 percent of adolescents from 12 to 17, have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. “If you’re really worried about your child getting sick, you should be vaccinating your child,” Dr. Maldonado said. “It’s the easiest thing we can do right now to keep our kids healthy.” As of Oct. 31, about one in three children hospitalized with Covid was obese. Still, about half had no other known medical conditions, according to data collected by the C.D.C."

The increase was observed in children aged 4 and younger, who are not eligible for vaccination, and the data include those admitted to hospitals for reasons other than Covid and then tested positive. The rise may at least be partly explained by the overall surge of Omicron cases, which affects all populations, as well as the spread of other respiratory infections. And officials said there was no sign of an increase in severe cases. More than four in 100,000 children aged 4 years or younger admitted to hospitals were infected with the coronavirus as of Jan. 1 — double the rate reported a month ago, and about three times the rate this time last year. By contrast, the rate of hospitalized children aged 5 through 11 years who were infected was 0.6 per 100,000, roughly the same rate seen over the past months. Children infected with the variant are still at much less risk of becoming severely ill than adults, and even young children seem less likely to need ventilators than those admitted during previous surges, experts said. “We have not yet seen a signal that there is any increased severity in this age demographic,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C.’s director, told reporters at a news briefing on Friday. She noted that similar worries about the Delta variant had proved to be unfounded. Yet the data do not show a similar steep rise in coronavirus infections among hospitalized children of other ages. That children aged 5 and older qualify for vaccination may account for some of the disparity, Dr. Walensky said. However, only 16 percent of children 5 through 11 are fully vaccinated. “Sadly, we are seeing the rates of hospitalizations increasing for children 0 to 4, who are not yet currently eligible for Covid-19 vaccination,” she said. “It’s critically important that we surround them with people who are vaccinated to provide them protection.” The agency has also updated recommendations for isolation of teachers and students infected with the coronavirus, and quarantine for those exposed to the virus, Dr. Walensky said. The recommendations align with those made for health care workers and the general population, suggesting an isolation period of five days. Dr. Walensky also responded to criticism that the messaging from the agency has been muddled and opaque, saying she has held 80 briefings since she took office, and sometimes multiple times a week. “But I hear that you are interested in hearing from the C.D.C. independently,” she said. Citigroup will dismiss unvaccinated employees by the end of the month as it presses on with a vaccine requirement the company announced in October. The bank has given staff based in the United States a deadline of Jan. 14 to submit proof of their inoculations against the coronavirus or request religious, medical or legal exemptions, according to a person familiar with the policies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Workers who do not comply with the mandate — which requires a full dose of vaccinations, not booster shots as well — will be placed on unpaid leave on Jan. 15 and fired Jan. 31, the person said. The person added that some staff might not receive year-end bonuses unless they signed documents agreeing not to sue the company. More than 90 percent of Citigroup’s 65,000 U.S. employees have complied with the requirement, the person said. Bloomberg News reported the news earlier.  Vaccine rules are a delicate issue for Wall Street firms and other large employers. JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, has not imposed a requirement, but said at the end of last year that government mandates could make it “difficult or impossible” for the company to continue to employ unvaccinated staff. Bank of America does not require inoculation as a condition of employment, either, but it has strongly encouraged staff to get vaccinations and boosters, and has asked workers to inform the company of their status.Members of the Supreme Court’s conservative majority, in arguments on Friday, seemed skeptical that the Biden administration has the legal power to mandate large employers to require coronavirus vaccinations or frequent testing. Across the nation’s biggest banks, policies around in-person work, vaccination and testing vary widely. Citigroup’s stance, which is among the strictest, is being resisted by some employees. “They’re not leaving people any choice,” Ben Shittu, a 37-year-old software engineer at Citigroup in Ireland, said in an interview Thursday. He has refused to be inoculated against the coronavirus, citing concerns about the efficacy and side effects of the new vaccines. Mr. Shittu said he had felt compelled to post a video opposing the bank’s policy after a contentious team meeting in November, during which his manager told employees that their jobs depended on getting the vaccine. Since then, Mr. Shittu said, he has been inundated with supportive messages from fellow workers. Staff members have also taken to discussing their concerns on private messaging apps as well as those operated by the bank. “What do I plan to do if Citi decides to fire me — I don’t think it’s relevant,” Mr. Shittu said. “If you lose one job, one door closes, another opportunity will always come around.” A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment on the concerns raised by Mr. Shittu. Vaccine policies and rising coronavirus cases have complicated Wall Street’s efforts to get employees back to their desks. With the Omicron variant spreading rapidly, the country is averaging more than 500,000 new coronavirus cases a day, far more than at any previous point in the pandemic. That surge has prompted banks including JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup to allow employees to work from home at the start of the year. WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court’s conservative majority seemed to be leaning on Friday toward blocking one of the White House’s main pandemic-fighting strategies, expressing skepticism that the Biden administration has the legal power to mandate that large employers require workers to be vaccinated or to undergo frequent testing. The oral argument over that mandate, which rocketed to the court on an emergency basis after a flurry of legal challenges around the nation from Republican-led states, business groups and others, raised the prospect that the court might deal a severe blow to the Biden administration’s efforts to address the coronavirus as the highly transmissible Omicron variant continues to spread. The court seemed more likely to allow a separate mandate requiring health care workers at facilities receiving federal money to be vaccinated. That regulation, the subject of a second case, was in keeping with other kinds of federal oversight of medical facilities and was supported by virtually the entire medical establishment, some justices said. But the questioning concerning the employer mandate was more lopsided. That regulation, one of the most far-reaching policies imposed by President Biden in a bid to control the pandemic, would affect 84 million American workers employed by companies with more than 100 workers. Several conservative justices said it was doubtful that a federal workplace safety law provided the administration with the legal authority to impose it. The court may act quickly in the case, which was argued on an exceptionally rapid schedule. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said the states and Congress, rather than a federal agency, were better suited to address the pandemic in the nation’s workplaces. “This is something that the federal government has never done before,” he said, adding that the administration’s several virus-related mandates were “a workaround” in response to congressional inaction. Justice Amy Coney Barrett said the challenged regulation appeared to reach too broadly in covering all large employers. Meatpacking plants and dental offices might be subject to regulation, she said, while landscapers should not be. Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh suggested that the governing statute had not authorized the agency to impose the mandate clearly enough, given the political and economic stakes. The hearing came as the Omicron variant has led to a steep rise in coronavirus cases, keeping people from returning to the office and increasing hospitalizations. Economists worry the surge in cases could halt job growth in the coming months. The court’s three more liberal justices said the mandate was a needed response to the public health crisis. “This is a pandemic in which nearly a million people have died,” Justice Elena Kagan said. “It is by far the greatest public health danger that this country has faced in the last century.” “We know that the best way to prevent spread is for people to get vaccinated,” she said. Justice Stephen G. Breyer said he would find it “unbelievable that it could be in the public interest to suddenly stop these vaccinations.” Some of the participants in the arguments were missing from the courtroom, probably because of the pandemic. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who has diabetes and had been the only member of the court to wear a mask since the justices returned to the courtroom in October, participated remotely from her chambers. On Friday, seven of the justices wore masks on the bench for the first time. The exception was Justice Gorsuch, who sits next to Justice Sotomayor. Two of the lawyers — Benjamin M. Flowers, the solicitor general of Ohio, and Elizabeth Murrill, the solicitor general of Louisiana — participated by telephone. The court’s Covid-19 protocols require lawyers to be tested for the virus. All of the justices are fully vaccinated and have received a booster shot, a court spokeswoman said. Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on Friday defended the agency’s new guidance shortening the isolation period for people infected with the coronavirus to five days from 10, saying it was “grounded in science.” Speaking during a sometimes contentious telephone briefing with reporters, Dr. Walensky also responded to criticism that the messaging from the agency has been muddled and opaque, saying that she has appeared at 80 White House briefings since she took office, and has sometimes taken questions multiple times a week. Friday’s news conference, conducted as the Omicron variant continues to drive a dramatic spike in coronavirus cases, was both rare and remarkable as the agency’s first briefing independent of the White House since former President Donald J. Trump put an end to them in February 2020.  “I hear that you are interested in hearing from the C.D.C. independently,” Dr. Walensky said, adding that she expected the briefing to be the first of many. A number of reporters, seeking information about the complicated decisions the agency makes, repeatedly thanked her. A highly regarded infectious disease expert with no government experience, Dr. Walensky, who was named to lead the C.D.C. at the start of the Biden administration, has faced many challenges. The agency’s reputation and morale were battered by the Trump White House, which often tried to interfere with its scientific decisions.  Now the nation is heading into the third year of a pandemic with a virus that, Dr. Walensky said, “has been constantly throwing curveballs,” which has been exhausting for health care workers and career government officials on the front lines of the response. “I think we’re all proud to serve the big, biggest public health crisis of our lifetimes,” said one such official, Dr. Henry Walke, the director of the C.D.C.’s Division of Preparedness and Emerging Infections, who joined Dr. Walensky on the call. “So yes, it’s exhausting. And it’s challenging, but good. Wow. I mean, this is a time to lean in.” Dr. Walke’s presence on the call was also unusual; C.D.C.’s career scientists have not participated in press calls since Mr. Trump ended them. Mr. Trump had grown enraged Dr. Nancy Messonnier, then director of the C.D.C.’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, warned during a news briefing that the coronavirus would severely disrupt Americans’ lives. Dr. Messonnier left the C.D.C. last year. Dr. Walensky has encountered intense criticism in recent days for a series of messaging missteps, the latest of which involved the new guidance for isolation, issued last week. Public health experts criticized its failure to recommend that people infected with the virus test negative before ending the shortened, five-day isolation period.  Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the president’s top medical adviser for the pandemic, and Dr. Vivek Murthy, the Surgeon General, publicly disagreed with the C.D.C.’s failure to include a testing recommendation, further confusing the issue. This week, the C.D.C. clarified that if people had access to tests, they could take them. CNN reported on Friday that Dr. Walensky had sought out media training this fall; an agency spokesman noted that was “not out of the ordinary” for agency directors. And Dr. Walensky herself said she was “committed to continue to improve as we learn more about the science and to communicate that with all of you” and the public. At Friday’s briefing, Dr. Walensky faced a barrage of sometimes confrontational questions, including about confusion over the guidance and her scientific rationale for it. She said it was based on a scientific review of dozens of papers analyzing the infectiousness of the coronavirus, although she conceded that many of them were based on variants other than Omicron. She said it would be weeks before scientists have detailed lab data for Omicron — including data on whether people infected with the highly transmissible variant can get infected with it again. “We have indication that if you’ve had Delta you are susceptible to infection with Omicron,” she said, referring to the earlier Delta variant of the virus. But, she said, there is not yet any data to suggest “that Omicron protects against Omicron.” Children who have recovered from Covid-19 appear to be at significantly increased risk of developing Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Friday. A heightened risk of diabetes has already been seen among adults who recovered from Covid, according to some studies. Researchers in Europe have reported an increase in the number of children being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes since the pandemic started.  But the C.D.C. study is among the first to examine large insurance claim databases in the United States to estimate the prevalence of new diabetes diagnoses in children under age 18 who had Covid or were known to be infected with the coronavirus.  The study used two claim databases from U.S. health plans to look at diabetes diagnoses made in youngsters under 18 over the course of a year or more, starting in March 1, 2020, comparing those who had Covid with those who did not.  The researchers found increases in diabetes in both data sets, though the relative rates were quite different: they found a 2.6-fold increase in new diabetes cases among children in one, and a smaller 30 percent increase in another. “Even a 30 percent increase is a big increase in risk,” said Sharon Saydah, a researcher at the C.D.C. and lead author of the study. The differences likely result from different ways of classifying children as having Covid, she added.  Dr. Saydah said it was not yet clear whether post-Covid Type 2 diabetes would be a chronic condition in these children, or a transient condition that resolves. (Type 1 diabetes is not reversible.) Most of the children were only followed about four and a half months. The finding underscores the importance of vaccinating all eligible children against Covid, she added, and using measures like masking and distancing, especially to protect the youngest, who cannot yet be vaccinated. “It’s really important for clinicians, pediatricians and parents to be aware of the signs and symptoms of diabetes, so they can get their kids diagnosed,” Dr. Saydah said. Increased thirst, frequent urination, unintentional weight loss and fatigue are among the telltale symptoms. She noted that weight gain and sedentary behavior, which have increased during the pandemic, are also risk factors for Type 2 diabetes. Many of the children in the study were only diagnosed after having an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening complication that occurs when the body doesn’t have enough insulin to allow blood sugar into cells to use for energy. Dr. Saydah and her colleagues did not distinguish between types of diabetes, including both Type 1 and Type 2 in their analysis. The increases were seen both among those who had been ill with Covid, and those who were asymptomatic but tested positive. Another study, also released on Friday by the C.D.C., found that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protected hospitalized youngsters between the ages of 12 and 18 against severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C, which can develop two to six weeks after infection with the virus.  The study looked at 24 hospitals in 20 states between July and Dec. 9, 2021, during the period when the Delta variant was dominant. It concluded that vaccination had an efficacy rate of 91 percent against MIS-C, and noted that among 38 hospitalized patients aged 12 to 18 who required life support, all were unvaccinated. New York will require health care workers to get a booster within two weeks of becoming eligible for one, Gov. Kathy Hochul said on Friday, as hospitals contend with crippling staff shortages amid the Omicron wave. The state is averaging about 70,000 new cases daily and is experiencing an alarming rise in hospitalizations, particularly of unvaccinated children. “We’ve already seen what’s been happening in our health care environments,” Ms. Hochul said. “Staff is getting sick, they’re leaving. We need them to get well, we need them to have the best fortification they possibly can, and that means getting a booster shot.” The governor said that the state health commissioner, Mary Bassett, would recommend the change to a state advisory council on Tuesday, and that they anticipated “swift approval.” The requirement would apply to all health care workers who do not have a valid medical exemption. Ms. Hochul also indicated that she would require visitors to nursing homes to wear “surgical-type” masks and show proof of a negative test. The State Health Department released a report on Friday showing that pediatric hospital admissions had shot up from 70 per week at the beginning of December to 571 per week by the end of the month. In New York City, they went from 22 per week to 385, and the number increased nearly tenfold in the Mid-Hudson area and on Long Island. The report found that hospitalizations were increasing faster for children than for adults, Dr. Eli Rosenberg, deputy director for science in the Health Department’s Office of Public Health, noted in an interview. Seventy percent of newly admitted children who tested positive for the virus were experiencing symptoms, and half had no comorbidities. “We’re very concerned about this alarming increase,” Dr. Rosenberg said, adding that there had been a dangerous tendency throughout the pandemic to brush off the risks for younger patients. “What we’re trying to show is there are serious consequences for some children.” Even for children who are not hospitalized primarily because of Covid, but are found to have it after being admitted, the virus could well be an aggravating factor in their medical treatment, he said. The report underscored the importance of vaccination for eligible children and anyone around them. More than 90 percent of hospitalized children ages 5 to 11, and 65 percent of those ages 12 to 17, were unvaccinated. Statewide, 31 percent of children ages 5 to 11 have received at least one vaccine dose, and 73 percent of those ages 12 to 17 have. People under 5 are not yet eligible for vaccinations, and that is the group of children who have seen the fastest increase in hospitalizations overall. Data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday also showed a nationwide increase in the number of children 4 and younger admitted to hospitals with the virus. The longstanding advice on masks and social distancing remains as important as ever, particularly for vulnerable children, Dr. Rosenberg said. “We want everyone to double down on what we’ve been saying and take it seriously,” he said. NASHVILLE — Alysa Liu, one of the favorites to make the U.S. Olympic figure skating team for next month’s Beijing Winter Games, tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday and withdrew from the U.S. national championships. Liu, 16, finished third in the short program at nationals on Thursday and was hoping that a strong showing in Friday’s free skate would strengthen her chances of making the Olympic team. Her fate now is in the hands of U.S. Figure Skating officials, who on Saturday will announce the U.S. women’s team headed to Beijing. They will pick the three female single skaters based on their body of work over the past year — not just on how they finish at nationals. That’s great news for Liu. She is one of the top-ranked American women and finished in the top five of both of her Grand Prix events this season. Later Friday, another contender for the Olympic team, Amber Glenn, tested positive and withdrew from nationals, depriving her of a last chance to impress the Olympic selection committee. She said she was experiencing symptoms. On Instagram, Liu — the senior national champion in 2019 and 2020 — wrote that she was fully vaccinated, had been wearing an N95 mask and twice tested negative before arriving at nationals. “Things happen unfortunately, but it is what it is,” she wrote of her positive test, adding that she felt good physically and mentally. She did not mention whether she was experiencing any symptoms of the virus. Liu was the second high-profile American skater to test positive at nationals. Brandon Frazier, who, with Alexa Knierim, is the reigning national pairs champion, withdrew from nationals on Wednesday after waking up feeling ill and then testing positive. “Although my symptoms are pretty bad, nothing sucks more than not being able to compete,” Frazier said on social media. Knierim wrote: “We have taken all the necessary precautions leading up to these championships, including but not limited to social distancing, the use of KN95 masks and canceling all holiday gatherings as well as private lessons at the rink, so it has been shocking and devastating for us to process what has happened.”  After testing positive on Friday morning, Glenn, who finished 14th in the short program and was among the top four women vying for the Olympic team, wrote on social media that she was heartbroken to withdraw from nationals after feeling sick: “Over the last 48hrs I progressively became slower, weak & sluggish… I thought it was the usual competition nerves and maybe allergies but after yesterday’s performance & the last two days of practices not feeling like myself at all I had a sinking feeling it was something more.”  And in part of her Instagram post that was later deleted, she said, ““To know I was competing while sick with covid is awful.” U.S. Figure Skating will announce the United States’ two Olympic pairs teams on Sunday, and Frazier and Knierim said they have petitioned to be selected for the Beijing Games. Oregon will deploy up to 500 National Guard members in the coming weeks to support health care workers as Covid hospitalizations rise in the state, Gov. Kate Brown said on Friday. Ms. Brown said that beginning next week, a first deployment of 125 personnel would go to work at hospitals, providing logistical support such as moving equipment and assisting with testing. “With more than 500 current hospitalizations and daily record-breaking numbers of Covid-19 cases, we are at another critical point in this pandemic,” Ms. Brown said in a statement. Her office said the state would work with hospital systems to monitor the need for additional National Guard deployments. Like other parts of the country, Oregon has recorded a rapid increase in infections since the arrival of the Omicron variant, with daily case counts now nearly double the previous peak over the summer. Covid hospitalizations are well below the summer peak but have started to rise again, up 40 percent since Christmas. Researchers at Oregon Health & Science University have projected that the hospitalization trend will continue and set new highs for the state by the end of the month. They encouraged people to avoid indoor gatherings, wear masks and get vaccinated or boosted as soon as possible. “Anything Oregonians can do now to reduce the spread of the virus will help to preserve hospital capacity for those who need it most,” said Dr. Peter Graven, the director of the university’s Office of Advanced Analytics. Governors of other states have also activated National Guard troops in recent days to help support health workers who are battling the Omicron surge.  Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said on Friday that more than 200 National Guard members would be deployed across 50 sites to help meet demand for testing. He said they would assist with crowd control and provide clinical care in places with staffing shortages. Royal Caribbean International announced on Friday that it was suspending some of its upcoming cruises because of concerns over the fast-spreading Omicron variant. The company, one of the world’s biggest cruise operators, said that it was taking the step “out of an abundance of caution.” This is the second time this week that Royal Caribbean has called off voyages. “We regret having to cancel our guests’ long-awaited vacations and appreciate their loyalty and understanding,” the company said in a statement on its website. “Our top priority is always the well-being of our guests, our crew and the communities we visit.” Royal Caribbean said it had called off planned trips on three ships — Serenade of the Seas, Symphony of the Seas and Jewel of the Seas — and pushed back the return to cruising of another, Vision of the Seas, to March. The cruising industry was shuttered by the pandemic for nearly 18 months. It made a comeback this past summer but has faced mounting criticism about its safety protocols in recent weeks. In December, clusters broke out aboard two Royal Caribbean cruises after they left port in Florida, and more than a dozen people tested positive on a Norwegian Cruise Line vessel after it returned to New Orleans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later urged Americans to avoid taking cruises, regardless of vaccination status, and raised its Covid-19 warning level for cruise ships to 4, the highest level. Last weekend, a New Year’s cruise operated by a German line, AIDA Cruises, was held up in Portugal when dozens of crew members tested positive. Passengers started testing positive a few days later. Royal Caribbean, which restarted its U.S. operations in June, requires travelers 12 and older to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and to test negative before boarding. Younger children who are not vaccinated must provide a negative P.C.R. test result before sailing and test negative at the terminal before boarding. The company has said all of its crew members are fully vaccinated and that they undergo weekly testing. The company is not alone in canceling cruises this week. Norwegian Cruise Line also suspended voyages in response to the growing number of coronavirus cases onboard some of its ships. Facing an alarming rise in coronavirus infections, residents of Salt Lake County, the largest county in Utah, will be required to wear masks at all indoor public settings for the next 30 days, regardless of vaccination status. Mayor Jenny Wilson of Salt Lake County signed the order on Friday night, which was issued earlier that day by Dr. Angela Dunn, the executive director of the Salt Lake County Health Department. The mandate will go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday and remain in effect until 5 p.m. on Feb. 7. In a statement, Ms. Wilson attributed the current wave to the fast-spreading Omicron variant and said it was putting “tremendous strain” on the area’s hospital system. The order requires residents to wear well-fitting face coverings when indoors or when lining up outdoors in public. It is a similar safety measure that other mayors and governors across the country have been reimposing to try to beat back spikes in Omicron infections. Those exempted include children aged 2 and younger, those with certain medical conditions or those who are actively eating and drinking at restaurants or bars.  The Salt Lake County Council has the power veto the order. A representative from the Salt Lake County Health Department said on Friday night that Dr. Dunn has been in regular contact with council members and is confident the mandate has the majority support necessary to hold. Salt Lake County, which encompasses the state capital, Salt Lake City, is experiencing a crush of cases, like many metropolitan areas in the nation. According to data from The New York Times, an average of 2,343 cases per day were reported in the county, a 518 percent increase from the average two weeks ago. The health department first issued a communitywide mask mandate in June 2020 that expired in January 2021. In August, Dr. Dunn ordered mask-wearing for students in K-6 schools, but the council overturned it. The new mandate is a necessary tool to fight the current surge, Ms. Wilson said in a video posted to Twitter after she signed the order. “It’s a challenge, I know,” Ms. Wilson said. “The more that we can do now, the quicker we’ll get this behind us.” WASHINGTON — In a pandemic high for the U.S. Navy base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, the hospital there on Friday reported 69 confirmed coronavirus cases among about 6,000 residents on the base. None of the infected people required hospitalization, medical evacuation or monoclonal antibody treatment, said Dawn Grimes, the spokeswoman at the base hospital, which serves both the community and the detention operation holding 39 wartime prisoners. She did not comment on whether any of the prisoners or roughly 1,500 military members and civilian employees who staff the operation had tested positive. Nearly all of the 69 people who tested positive for the virus had been fully vaccinated, Ms. Grimes said. A few were partly vaccinated. One of the 69 included a 10-year-old child who is either fully or half vaccinated, said a base spokeswoman, Nikki L. Maxwell, on Saturday. No other details were available. On Tuesday, the base commander, Capt. Samuel White, reinstated an indoor mask mandate for all residents in response to what he called “this uptick in cases.” That day, Ms. Grimes reported that 17 people on the base had tested positive since Dec. 1, all but one of them fully vaccinated. Until this week, only the estimated 900 unvaccinated people on the base had been required to wear masks indoors, making for crowds of unmasked patrons in the base’s Irish pub and at the gym. Ms. Grimes said Friday that, in response to the surge, the base was requiring vaccinated visitors and returning residents to be tested on arrival, isolate for at least three days, and then be tested again before they can rejoin the community. Unvaccinated people have been consistently required to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival. She added that public health workers had at times this week carried out about 250 tests in a single day, and that the small community hospital had sufficient testing capacity to do more if needed. “Our Covid-19 hotline team continues to field calls around the clock to answer Covid-19-related questions and to provide screening for individuals who are experiencing symptoms,” she said. The base also introduced round-the-clock curbside testing at the hospital, which sends its most serious or complex cases to the United States for military medical care. The detainees are the exception: The Pentagon sends specialists, including neurosurgeons with specialized equipment, to treat the prisoners, many of whom are approaching their third decade in U.S. detention. Cases rose after a Navy ship from Jacksonville, Fla., the U.S.S. Milwaukee, stayed at the base pier from Christmas through New Year’s with about one-fourth of its 105-member crew infected. Most had mild or asymptomatic cases. Guantánamo has reported an 85 percent vaccination rate, meaning roughly 900 base residents declined or were ineligible for vaccines. Some of them are the young children of sailors and Navy contractors who live in suburban-style housing on the base. MIAMI — About a million rapid coronavirus tests that Florida had amassed during the pandemic expired last month, the state acknowledged this week, blaming low demand before the Omicron variant caused a surge in infections. “We had a stockpile, but no one really wanted them for many, many months,” Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, said on Friday as he faced a second day of questions about the expired tests, which are not for use at home. The state asked the federal government if the expiration date could be extended but has not heard back, Kevin Guthrie, the director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said on Thursday. The batch had been set to expire in the fall, he added, but their shelf life was extended until late December. Mr. DeSantis and his administration confirmed that the tests had expired after Nikki Fried, the state’s agricultural commissioner, revealed on Dec. 30 that the stockpile had not been used. Ms. Fried is one of the Democratic candidates running to challenge Mr. DeSantis, who is up for re-election in November. The governor has criticized the Biden administration for failing to provide more at-home tests. On Thursday, Mr. DeSantis announced that Florida had purchased a million of them to distribute to nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Like many other Americans, Floridians have faced long waits at testing sites for weeks as coronavirus cases spiked. At-home tests have been difficult to come by. On Thursday, Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo, the Florida surgeon general, released new testing guidelines discouraging asymptomatic people who are not at high risk of developing Covid-19 complications from getting tested — an approach opposed by most public health experts, because infected people can spread the virus even if they don’t have symptoms. Mr. DeSantis, however, has endorsed the new guidelines, saying too much testing is disruptive. Requiring asymptomatic people to isolate if they test positive is “essentially a lockdown by stealth,” he said on Friday. “Before Covid, did anyone go out and get testing to determine if you’re sick?” he said. “It’s usually if you feel sick.” It was promoted as a New Year’s Eve celebration in Cancún, Mexico — a six-night trip that included parties with open bars and a day exploring Tulum, a popular tourist destination in the Yucatán Peninsula known for its ancient ruins and the turquoise water of its beaches. The adventure began with a privately chartered plane from Montreal where the guests — a coterie of Canadian social media influencers, reality television personalities and others — were entertained by a D.J. on the flight to Mexico. But the trip has turned into a fiasco after videos surfaced on social media showing the passengers flouting Canada’s pandemic restrictions. Airlines have shunned the group, stranding many of its members in Mexico, and the Canadian authorities are vowing to investigate. In the videos, the passengers are seen dancing and jumping in the aisles, yelling without masks on and passing around bottles of alcohol. One woman can be seen vaping in the cabin. Another passenger, his mask hanging under his chin, yells at his fellow travelers over the cabin intercom to sit down, and then “to keep the energy up.” “Let’s hear some noise, welcome to 111 Private Club!” the same passenger says in a video, referring to an online group described as “invitation only” that was founded by James William Awad, a musician and self-described entrepreneur who organized the trip. The passengers, many of them without masks on, yell back in approval. About 27 of the 130 passengers on the flight are back in Canada, the country’s health minister, Jean-Yves Duclos, told reporters on Friday. “They were all stopped and interrogated at the border,” he said, adding that they were tested for the virus and asked about their proof of vaccination and their quarantine plans. It was among the country’s deadliest coronavirus outbreaks: One in every three residents of a New Jersey nursing home for frail military veterans died as the virus raced unchecked through the state-run facility. The 101 residents who died in the first eight months of the pandemic included both of Regina Costantino Discenza’s parents, who had been living at the complex, Menlo Park Veterans Memorial Home in Edison, N.J., for about two years when the virus began ravaging long-term care centers throughout the Northeast. Three days after her father died, her mother tested positive for the virus. “It was a horror show,” said Ms. Discenza, who inscribed the headstone at her parents’ grave with the words “2020 pandemic victims.” A state-run veterans' home in Paramus, about 40 miles north, had an equally devastating death toll: 89. Now, in a sober acknowledgment of failings, New Jersey has agreed to pay $53 million to families of 119 veterans who lived in the two facilities. The families had been preparing to file lawsuits that accused the state of gross negligence. The average payout is expected to be roughly $445,000 as part of an out-of-court settlement that is believed to be the first of its kind nationwide. But similar lawsuits are pending across the country against private and public nursing homes. Dozens of suits are linked to deaths at state-run veterans homes in Illinois and in Massachusetts, where 76 residents of the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home perished during the chaotic first months of the pandemic. Further British Army personnel will be sent to help in hospitals this week as the country’s National Health Service struggles with a surge in coronavirus patients and the absence of tens of thousands of health workers, many of whom have contracted the virus themselves.  The U.K. Ministry of Defense announced in a statement on Friday that 200 soldiers, including defense medics, would be available to support hospitals in London, while another 32 would work with an ambulance service in the South of England. The troops in London will assist the N.H.S. over the next three weeks, working “hand-in-hand to protect the nation from Covid-19,” Ben Wallace, the country’s defense secretary, said in the statement. And an army deployment began in Aberdeen, Scotland, on Friday, after a request from health services in three areas of Scotland for additional military personnel was approved in December last year. Over the course of the pandemic, it has become standard procedure for the army to temporarily step into civilian roles, even helping to deliver gas when a shortage struck last year. More than 1,000 service members were already at work in Britain’s booster vaccination program or helping to maintain ambulance services, according to the defense ministry statement. Nearly two year of pandemic have put relentless pressure on hospitals across the country, and in London in particular, where a surge in cases of the highly infectious Omicron variant began earlier than in much of the country. The health service was grappling with staff shortages even before the pandemic, and a recent report by the British Parliament’s Health and Social Care Committee, focusing on the backlog of medical care created by the pandemic, spoke of a “serious staffing crisis,” with 93,000 N.H.S. job vacancies in England unfilled. “Omicron means more patients to treat and fewer staff to treat them,” the N.H.S. national medical director for England, Stephen Powis, said in a statement. More than 80,000 health service workers were absent each day on average, a 13 percent rise compared to the previous week, according to N.H.S. England. “Almost half of all absences are now down to Covid,” Professor Powis continued. Coronavirus case numbers in the country remain high, with 179,756 confirmed across the country on Thursday. More than 70 percent of people in Britain have had two Covid shots, according to figures compiled by the Our World in Data project, and more than half have had a third or booster shot.    At least 20 Hong Kong lawmakers, the city’s police chief and several other senior officials are being sent to centralized quarantine after attending a birthday party on Monday, in an embarrassing political and public health headache for the city’s already deeply unpopular government. In all, around 170 people — all the guests at the party, as well as their close contacts — are to be sent to a centralized quarantine facility, city officials announced on Friday, after two people who attended tested positive for the coronavirus. Already, around 60 people have been sent to Penny’s Bay, a facility of shipping-container-like dormitories on an outlying island. The revelation came as Hong Kong, which had gone months without any local transmission, prepares for a new outbreak linked to the Omicron variant. And it followed vigorous calls from the government — which has imposed some of the harshest quarantine and social distancing measures in the world — for residents to avoid public gatherings. The party, at a Spanish tapas restaurant, was for Witman Hung, a local delegate to the Chinese national legislature. Attendees included Caspar Tsui, the city’s home affairs secretary; Raymond Siu, the police commissioner; Au Ka-wang, the immigration director; and 20 lawmakers, who were sworn in this week for a new term. At least one of those lawmakers, Junius Ho, also traveled to Shenzhen two days after the party to meet with a top Chinese government official. At a news conference on Thursday after news of the party emerged, Carrie Lam, the city’s leader, said she was “very disappointed” in the government officials. Several of them have also issued apologies. “I have reflected on this incident and shall be more vigilant in future,” Mr. Au, the immigration director, said in a statement on Friday.  Mr. Au had already been fined last year for breaching social distancing rules at a hot-pot dinner in March. In other news from around the globe: There is vaccine hesitancy, but on the flip side, there is Brahmdeo Mandal. Mr. Mandal is so excited about the healing promise of a jab that he says he has received 12 coronavirus vaccine doses — so far. How, you may ask? Mr. Mandal, an 85-year-old retired postman from the northern Indian state of Bihar, is happy to share. He said he received his first dose on Feb. 13 at a local clinic, and he hasn’t stopped since. He has recorded the date and location of each jab in a pocket notebook. His ninth shot, he said, was on Sept. 24 at 12:32 p.m. at a hospital in Kalashan, Madhepura District. “I felt that it was helping my general health,” he said in a phone interview. “My backache has improved, my general weakness improved, and my appetite improved.” “I was always looking for new vaccine camps and would go there,” Mr. Mandal said. “Nobody would recognize me.” Dr. Amarendra Narayan Shahi, the chief medical officer in Madhepura, said he had spoken to Mr. Mandal who had told him about his quest to get more doses because he believed it cured his ailments, many of them natural at his age. “Yes, he is claiming that he got 12 doses,” Dr. Shahi said. “I have constituted a three-member investigating team to find the truth.” For nine of the 12 shots Mr. Mandal registered to receive, he said he used his national identity card and his mobile number. After that, he said, he switched to alternative forms of identification, like his voting card and the mobile numbers of his wife and his friends. Exactly how Mr. Mandal was found out is unclear, but it appeared to be a case of him boasting about his many boosters to someone who had then tipped off the local news media. Authorities in the district of Madhepura say they have also started an investigation. There is no indication that supercharging the immune system with 12 shots brings any real benefits, or would help with anything other than what the vaccine is intended to do. In fact, there is an ongoing debate on whether boosting the immune system over and over can cause it to become fatigued, or to prevent it from responding to future versions of the vaccine. Only an investigation will confirm whether Mr. Mandal received the multitude of doses that he claims. But there have certainly been many irregularities in Bihar during India’s vaccination drive — a massive undertaking with 1.5 billion doses administered so far. In September, when a remarkable 25 million doses were administered to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday, Bihar topped the list of states with about 3.4 million doses. But media reports later suggested that Bihar’s vaccination numbers were likely inaccurate — that data from offline vaccinations from previous days were intentionally withheld and uploaded on the campaign day to inflate the total. Weeks later, it also emerged that one district in Bihar had been reporting ghost vaccinations: Among those recorded as having received the vaccine in the district, but who clearly had not, were Prime Minister Modi himself, as well as some Bollywood celebrities. It is precisely the manual registration that would have come in handy in Mr. Mandal’s quest to keep getting shots before boosters were being offered — and then to keep on boosting every month or so, he said. Mr. Mandal admitted that each time he registered for a new jab, he was asked whether or not he had previously received the shot. “Every time I told them a lie — that I had not,” he said. Dr. Shahi, the district medical chief, said internet problems in Madhepura were such that in many areas vaccinations happened offline and the data was uploaded later. He said what was surprising, if Mr. Mandal’s claim turns out true, is that the portal did not detect repeat uploads when the data went online. As for Mr. Mandal, he said he would keep looking for new opportunities. “I still want more,” he said. Health officials in India said on Friday that they would retest some 300 passengers on two flights who tested positive for the coronavirus upon landing in the northern city of Amritsar, as the results raised questions about the tests’ accuracy. Officials said that 125 people who flew from Italy to Amritsar tested positive on Thursday. All of the passengers had been required to show proof of a negative P.C.R. test before boarding the flight, in line with Indian travel rules, said a spokesman for the airport in Bergamo, near Milan. Then, on Friday, at least 173 passengers on another flight from Italy tested positive after landing in Amritsar, said the city’s chief medical officer, Dr. Charanjit Singh. The high number of positive tests, all carried out by the same testing agency, SpiceHealth, created doubts about their accuracy, Dr. Singh said. “From tomorrow onwards, we are changing the testing agency,” he added. Reports of the positive tests created a stir in both India and Italy, especially considering the strict rules for traveling between the countries. Regular flights between them are suspended until the end of January. Both flights that arrived in Amritsar were chartered flights, believed to be carrying Indian nationals who work in Italy and their families. The Indian health authorities have designated Italy as a high-risk country for Covid-19. To board a flight leaving Italy for India, passengers need to show proof of a negative P.C.R. test taken within 72 hours of departure, regardless of vaccination status. Upon arrival in India, all travelers are required to isolate for seven days. All of the passengers from Italy who tested positive this week were placed in government quarantine facilities, Dr. Singh said. It was not immediately clear how soon they would be retested. Many Americans have been waiting in long lines at free testing sites since before the Christmas and New Year’s holiday rush. Plenty of others are avoiding the lines and paying $20 or more for over-the-counter, at-home tests — if they can find one. Out of options, some have headed to crowded emergency rooms in hopes of getting tested, putting themselves and others at greater risk and potentially delaying emergency care for ill and injured people. “The current demand for testing far exceeds the testing resources that are available,” said Michael T. Osterholm, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. That was evident this week as many people searched for tests to take before returning to school or work. President Biden addressed the problem last month by announcing that 500 million tests would be available for free starting in January. But his administration has not given a launch date for the program, and that number of tests will not go far in a country with a population of some 330 million.  Jenna Zitomer, 25, said that her family of five in Westchester, N.Y., has spent around $680 on rapid tests in recent months. “It’s pretty crazy, especially since that’s well over half a paycheck for me,” said Ms. Zitomer, a research specialist. “It feels like something we need to start budgeting for every month now, like groceries or utilities. For my family, not having access to testing could mean exposing multiple severely immunocompromised people to Covid-19. That basically makes it life or death.” Ms. Zitomer added that at her local testing center, “lines have gotten so long that they started canceling appointments and full days of testing because the drive-through lines cause traffic problems.” Britt Crow-Miller, 35, a senior lecturer at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said that her family has spent around $500 on at-home test kits. With two adults and three children, a single round costs around $100. “Who can afford that every time someone has the sniffles?” she said. “As a person fortunate enough to be well-employed and have a partner who is also well-employed, I am very conscious of the fact that at-home testing is essentially a luxury.” And yet, Ms. Crow-Miller, said that if one of the children “wakes up with a scratchy throat, I don’t feel like a responsible community member sending them to school without first giving them a test.""  Elizabeth Sasser, 24, a network planning analyst living in Syracuse, N.Y., said her expenses for tests — about $300 — was well spent. “My family also did have asymptomatic positives,” she said, “which would have likely led to more infections if it had not been for the prior purchase of at-home tests.” There have been gaps in testing capacity since the start of the pandemic. In early 2020, researchers scrambled to find the swabs and liquids needed to collect and store samples being sent to laboratories for polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., tests, considered the gold standard for viral detection. U.S. testing backlogs continued into that summer, in part because there was a shortage of tiny pieces of tapered plastic, called pipette tips, that are used to quickly and precisely move liquid between vials. The equipment shortage is no longer the weak link in the supply chain, but new problems have arisen. One is simply that demand is outstripping supply. There is also preliminary evidence that the at-home antigen tests many Americans rely on — at least as currently administered, with a nasal swab — may fail to detect some Omicron cases in the first days of infection. Researchers say Omicron replicates faster or earlier in the throat and mouth than in the nose. That could complicate the strategy for beating back the current wave, in which the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that Omicron accounts for 95 percent of new cases. The at-home tests, which can deliver results in minutes, remain an important public health tool, scientists say. Positive results are especially informative because it can take days to get results from P.C.R. tests. But a negative at-home test should be treated with caution. “Everyone wants these tests to do more than they can,” Dr. Osterholm said. A $46 billion federal program enacted by Congress to prevent evictions during the coronavirus pandemic got off to a sluggish start last year, but is now distributing cash so quickly that many states are running out of money, endangering millions of struggling tenants who depend on the support. On Friday, the Biden administration announced that 665,000 households had received aid through the Emergency Rental Assistance Program in November, the most ever for any month, bringing the total distributed or planned to be spent to between $25 billion and $30 billion, according to the Treasury Department. But that success means that several states, including New York, Texas and Oregon, have already used up nearly their entire share of federal funding from the program. And the new numbers underscore the reality that the federal government’s largest-ever attempt to prevent evictions was never intended to be a long-term solution. Funds for struggling renters will soon disappear unless Congress renews funding, which is highly unlikely. “There is tremendous uncertainty now, especially for renters,” said Vincent Reina, a professor of urban planning at the University of Pennsylvania who has helped design aid programs in Philadelphia. “Historically, we have had a nonexistent housing safety net nationally. Then we suddenly have this allocation of resources, and we build this whole new infrastructure. Now it’s about to go away, and we have no idea if it will ever be rebuilt.” Those who have already received rental assistance can keep it. But renters who want to file for the first time or reapply may be out of luck."

And it will never change because the answer is easy. The greatest American movie star is Sidney Poitier. You mean the greatest Black movie star? I don’t. Am I being controversial? Confrontational? Contrarian? No. I’m simply telling the truth. Who did more with less? Of whom was less expected as much as more? Who had more eyes and more daggers, more hopes and fears and intentions aimed his way, at his person, his skill and, by extension, his people? Race shouldn’t matter here. But it must, since Hollywood made his race the matter. Movie after movie insisted he be the Black man for white America, which he was fine with, of course. He was Black. But the radical shock of Sidney Poitier was the stress his stardom placed on “man.” Human. Let’s say Mr. Poitier had a good 20-year run as a star, from 1958, when “The Defiant Ones” came out, to 1978, when the last of his hit trilogy with Bill Cosby left movie theaters. He was making just about a movie a year, many of them unmemorable. On one hand, that’s stardom. On the other: Mr. Poitier achieved his greatness partially as a matter of “despite.” He achieved all he did despite knowing what he couldn’t do. I mean, he could’ve done it — could’ve played Cool Hand Luke, could’ve been the Graduate, could’ve done “Bullitt,” could have been Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. There are maybe a dozen roles, capstones, that nobody would have offered to Mr. Poitier because he Wouldn’t Have Been Right for the Part. I believe with all my heart that Mr. Poitier was as crucial in the odyssey of freedom and equality for Black Americans — for personhood — as Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, as Martin Luther King Jr. A clear descendant of Douglass’s rhetorical brilliance, he spoke the words of white people but from his own mouth. His projected image begot what is now a galaxy of other Black actors, doing acting as diverse and tiered as a shopping mall. Black artists in this country bear the curious, hilarious burden of history. Their work has to advance; to answer, to question, sit with, and not know. To take on, to risk. To do not only more, but often the most. It must also counteract and dispel; it must undo. Mr. Poitier was American art’s great undoer. In the movies, Black characters were jolly statuary — hoisting luggage, serving food, tending children — meant to decorate a white American’s dream. Acting could be a carceral affair. Mr. Poitier arrived at the start of the civil rights movement, in time to spring the Black image from the prison of the antebellum and minstrelsy eras. He was scarcely the first to try. He just led more people farther down the road than any other artist. Of course, what ensued instead was complicated: a kind of prisoner swap. This undoing business is tricky. The undoer must be both historic and a vessel of history. So Mr. Poitier was accused of being all kinds of Uncle Tom, because the task of undoing has tended to require collaboration with white people. It’s what they did or what was carried out in their name that needs to be undone. The collaborative act opened all parties to the opprobrium of their respective people. On Sept. 10, 1967, at Mr. Poitier’s apogee, this newspaper ran a scathing piece by Clifford Mason that asked, “Why Does White America Love Poitier So?” Mr. Poitier’s very best friend was Harry Belafonte; even he had his concerns. “Sidney radiated a truly saintly calm and dignity,” Mr. Belafonte wrote in his memoir, “My Song.” “I didn’t want to tone down my sexuality, either. Sidney did that in every role he took. I don’t want to put the full rap on race. Sidney is a wonderful actor, and he mesmerized audiences with all his performances. But he knows as well as I do that these nuances were fundamental to his success.” That saintliness was the exquisitely bitter joke of John Guare’s “Six Degrees of Separation” — that a sure way for a con man to enter the hearts and homes of Manhattan’s white elite was to pose as the preppy son of Mr. Poitier, the father of six daughters. Mr. Poitier’s gallery of highly educated, gleamingly polished, seductively agreeable characters had to be fit for entrance into white people’s homes but also attractive to Black people worried that he might think himself too good for dinner at theirs. That was as much a conundrum in 1958 as it was, say, half a century later when the country conducted an experiment to discover the measurement of Blackness appropriate for a president. Like Barack Obama, Mr. Poitier was punctual, culturally. He became the star he did because he was the star we desperately needed him to be. And even then he couldn’t please us all. One is left to imagine how much greater the greatest could’ve been. No romances — none where the woman wasn’t literally blind, as she was in “A Patch of Blue,” none in which the trouble wasn’t the romance itself, where the romance wasn’t in trouble because of the fact of him. Nothing with Audrey Hepburn or Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe or Doris Day. Nobody dared use him in a love story to make earlier stars of Cicely Tyson or Ruby Dee, or a bigger one of Diahann Carroll, the love of his offscreen life. The movie romance he and Ms. Carroll did have, in “Paris Blues” from 1961, was a timeshare with Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward. Mr. Poitier was denied opportunities we’ll never be able to prove he was denied. We can reasonably deduce, however, that he could’ve been bigger than he was. But he also managed to be as big as he became, which, in itself, is a wow. He had the best 1967 and ’68 of anybody. Three box-office smashes — “To Sir, With Love,” “In the Heat of the Night,” “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” two of them competing best picture Oscar nominees (“Heat” won), Oscars for two of his co-stars. Years ago, when the movies were basically still the country’s dominant art form, the American Film Institute released a countdown of the greatest stars of all time who made their debut before or in 1950. No. 1 in the male category was not Sidney Poitier, who arrived right at the list’s deadline. (That was Humphrey Bogart.) He wasn’t even No. 10. (Charlie Chaplin.) Nope, the Great American Movie Star was down at No. 22, just ahead of Robert Mitchum and behind three of the Marx Brothers. But let’s apply some cynical pressure here. What do the people who got Poitier to 22 on that greatest actors list believe warranted his being even that high? There were 49 other people on it, evenly split between women and men. He’s the only nonwhite person. Even now, I suspect, Mr. Poitier’s legacy really has been reduced to his firstness. And that’s not nothing, either. He was summoned to symbolize Black America, single-handedly; to receive his white peers’ congratulations when they make him the first Black man to accept their Oscar (for building a church for German nuns in “Lilies of the Field”). And so the milestone is the achievement. Mr. Poitier’s firstness is what puts him at the tippy top of all the home pages and front pages the day he dies. But what does he leave? Well — well! — that’s what makes him the greatest. Like every significant star before him — Clark Gable, Bette Davis, John Wayne, Humphrey Bogart, Mae West — Poitier made being in a movie look to the manner born. His least inspired line readings retain a spark of passion. Each word — words that could sometimes constitute the dregs of the English language (“the agonies, the torments, the humiliations … all these are the natural elements from which the key is forged,” spake Mr. Poitier, as the mixed-up enslaved insurrectionist Rau-Ru, in 1957’s unspeakable “Band of Angels”) — seemed to have originated in his head. His most daring work turned out to be a sustained performance of himself. I know: This is a star’s only job. But Mr. Poitier’s was a self he forged, sculpted and refined, a self that, though it bore only the perfume of an island upbringing, carried a note of exotic mystery. Even when they dressed him like an outer-space pimp in “The Long Ships,” he was no mere persona of a movie Negro, like the ancestral caricatures who made him necessary and the carload of badasses who thrived in his wake — the Sweetbacks, Shafts and Priests, the Hammers and Dolemites. Nobody had experienced anybody like him before. Just listen to the meter of his lilt, the melody of it. When he spoke, you heard a symphony. His placelessness gave him the same advantageous allure of other placeless stars. The acting he did required every inch of his long body — for exuberance, rapture, caution, solemnity and rage. In no conventional sense has a Sidney Poitier character ever danced with any success. (When he cuts a rug, you should keep a tourniquet handy.) Yet all of his characters proceed with grace and poise. Some of that is training; he was our most famous Black Method actor. The rest is simply him. The clenched fists and mid-promenade pivots, the column-hugging and thrown-open arms — it was all his own ballet. These were signature moves, a star making exclamatory punctuation of his being, carrying himself in cursive. The signature of what this country has always sworn it aspires to be."

Another passenger, his mask hanging under his chin, yells at his fellow travelers over the cabin intercom to sit down, and then, “to keep the energy up.” “Let’s hear some noise, welcome to 111 Private Club!” the same passenger says in a video, referring to an online group described as “invitation only” that was founded by James William Awad, a musician and self-described entrepreneur who organized the trip. The passengers, many of them without masks on, yell back in approval. About 27 of the 130 passengers on the flight are back in Canada, the country’s health minister, Jean-Yves Duclos, told reporters on Friday. “They were all stopped and interrogated at the border,” he said, adding that they were tested for Covid-19 and asked about their proof of vaccination and their quarantine plans. Many passengers apparently remained stranded in Mexico after at least three airlines said they would not fly them back. “The 111 private club is working tirelessly to get everyone back home safely as quickly as we can,” Mr. Awad said in a statement posted Thursday on a personal blog. “I understand why many fellow citizens are upset about the current situation,” he said earlier in the statement. “As someone who enjoys bringing people together, I committed to hosting a private and safe event in Cancún with my group from the 111 private club.” Transport Canada, the country’s transportation authority, said it was investigating the conduct of the passengers, who could face fines of up to $5,000 for violating Canada’s Covid-19 restrictions, which forbid passengers from traveling without masks. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the behavior seen on the plane “a slap in the face” to people who have abided by Covid-19 restrictions on planes and at home. “I think, like all Canadians who’ve seen those videos, I’m extremely frustrated,” he said. “We know how hard people have worked to keep themselves safe, to limit their family gatherings at Christmastime, to wear masks, to get vaccinated, to do all the right things.” Sunwing Airlines, which flew the group to Cancún on Dec. 30, said it canceled the return flight to Canada after an internal investigation found that the passengers “exhibited unruly behavior and did not respect aviation or public health regulations.” “Our decision to cancel the return flight was based on the group’s refusal to accept all terms and our security team’s assessment that noncompliance would be likely based on their previous disruptive onboard behavior,” the company said in a statement on Friday. Mr. Awad said in his statement that he had agreed to “every demand” made by the airline but had objected to Sunwing’s refusal to provide meals during the five-hour return flight. He later wrote on Twitter that the sticking point was not over meals and that he had “simply asked Sunwing to try and do something about it.” In its statement, Sunwing did not elaborate on how the flight crew responded to the passengers or whether the captain was aware of what was happening during the flight to Mexico. Air Canada said it denied flights to 19 people who were linked to the group, according to CTV News. “To the extent that we can identify the passengers who were part of the group, we are denying boarding to ensure the safety of other passengers and our crews,” Air Canada said. Air Transat, another Canadian airline, said on Twitter that it refused to take the passengers back home after they tried to book a flight through the airline. “We confirm that they will be denied boarding based on our legal and regulatory obligations to ensure the safety of both our passengers and crew, which is our top priority,” Air Transat said. The passengers crowding the aisles compromised the ability of flight attendants to move through the cabin and help anyone who could have been hurt or needed medical attention, said Mark Millam, the vice president of technical programs for Flight Safety Foundation, which provides safety guidelines for the aviation and aerospace industry. Had sudden turbulence hit the airplane, the passengers standing in the aisles could have been seriously injured, Mr. Millam said. “The aircraft wasn’t designed to be a dance floor,” he said. In his statement, Mr. Awad said that the trip was the first travel event planned by the 111 Private Club, which he described as “a dream and a vision.” He added, “I have significantly learned, and I am still learning from this experience.”"

Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on Friday defended the agency’s new guidance shortening the isolation period for people infected with the coronavirus to five days from 10, saying it was “grounded in science.” Speaking during a sometimes contentious telephone briefing with reporters, Dr. Walensky also responded to criticism that the messaging from the agency has been muddled and opaque, saying that she has appeared at 80 White House briefings since she took office, and has sometimes taken questions multiple times a week. Friday’s news conference, conducted as the Omicron variant continues to drive a dramatic spike in coronavirus cases, was both rare and remarkable as the agency’s first briefing independent of the White House since former President Donald J. Trump put an end to them in February 2020.  “I hear that you are interested in hearing from the C.D.C. independently,” Dr. Walensky said, adding that she expected the briefing to be the first of many. A number of reporters, seeking information about the complicated decisions the agency makes, repeatedly thanked her. A highly regarded infectious disease expert with no government experience, Dr. Walensky, who was named to lead the C.D.C. at the start of the Biden administration, has faced many challenges. The agency’s reputation and morale were battered by the Trump White House, which often tried to interfere with its scientific decisions.  Now the nation is heading into the third year of a pandemic with a virus that, Dr. Walensky said, “has been constantly throwing curveballs,” which has been exhausting for health care workers and career government officials on the front lines of the response. “I think we’re all proud to serve the big, biggest public health crisis of our lifetimes,” said one such official, Dr. Henry Walke, the director of the C.D.C.’s Division of Preparedness and Emerging Infections, who joined Dr. Walensky on the call. “So yes, it’s exhausting. And it’s challenging, but good. Wow. I mean, this is a time to lean in.” Dr. Walke’s presence on the call was also unusual; C.D.C.’s career scientists have not participated in press calls since Mr. Trump ended them. Mr. Trump had grown enraged Dr. Nancy Messonnier, then director of the C.D.C.’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, warned during a news briefing that the coronavirus would severely disrupt Americans’ lives. Dr. Messonnier left the C.D.C. last year. Dr. Walensky has encountered intense criticism in recent days for a series of messaging missteps, the latest of which involved the new guidance for isolation, issued last week. Public health experts criticized its failure to recommend that people infected with the virus test negative before ending the shortened, five-day isolation period.  Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the president’s top medical adviser for the pandemic, and Dr. Vivek Murthy, the Surgeon General, publicly disagreed with the C.D.C.’s failure to include a testing recommendation, further confusing the issue. This week, the C.D.C. clarified that if people had access to tests, they could take them. CNN reported on Friday that Dr. Walensky had sought out media training this fall; an agency spokesman noted that was “not out of the ordinary” for agency directors. And Dr. Walensky herself said she was “committed to continue to improve as we learn more about the science and to communicate that with all of you” and the public. At Friday’s briefing, Dr. Walensky faced a barrage of sometimes confrontational questions, including about confusion over the guidance and her scientific rationale for it. She said it was based on a scientific review of dozens of papers analyzing the infectiousness of the coronavirus, although she conceded that many of them were based on variants other than Omicron. She said it would be weeks before scientists have detailed lab data for Omicron — including data on whether people infected with the highly transmissible variant can get infected with it again. “We have indication that if you’ve had Delta you are susceptible to infection with Omicron,” she said, referring to the earlier Delta variant of the virus. But, she said, there is not yet any data to suggest “that Omicron protects against Omicron.”   "

A heightened risk of diabetes has already been seen among adults who recovered from Covid, according to some studies. Researchers in Europe have reported an increase in the number of children being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes since the pandemic started.  But the C.D.C. study is among the first to examine large insurance claim databases in the United States to estimate the prevalence of new diabetes diagnoses in children under age 18 who had Covid or were known to be infected with the coronavirus.  The study used two claim databases from U.S. health plans to look at diabetes diagnoses made in youngsters under 18 over the course of a year or more, starting in March 1, 2020, comparing those who had Covid with those who did not.  The researchers found increases in diabetes in both data sets, though the relative rates were quite different: they found a 2.6-fold increase in new diabetes cases among children in one, and a smaller 30 percent increase in another. “Even a 30 percent increase is a big increase in risk,” said Sharon Saydah, a researcher at the C.D.C. and lead author of the study. The differences likely result from different ways of classifying children as having Covid, she added.  Dr. Saydah said it was not yet clear whether post-Covid Type 2 diabetes would be a chronic condition in these children, or a transient condition that resolves. (Type 1 diabetes is not reversible.) Most of the children were only followed about four and a half months. The finding underscores the importance of vaccinating all eligible children against Covid, she added, and using measures like masking and distancing, especially to protect the youngest, who cannot yet be vaccinated. “It’s really important for clinicians, pediatricians and parents to be aware of the signs and symptoms of diabetes, so they can get their kids diagnosed,” Dr. Saydah said. Increased thirst, frequent urination, unintentional weight loss and fatigue are among the telltale symptoms. She noted that weight gain and sedentary behavior, which have increased during the pandemic, are also risk factors for Type 2 diabetes. Many of the children in the study were only diagnosed after having an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening complication that occurs when the body doesn’t have enough insulin to allow blood sugar into cells to use for energy. Dr. Saydah and her colleagues did not distinguish between types of diabetes, including both Type 1 and Type 2 in their analysis. The increases were seen both among those who had been ill with Covid, and those who were asymptomatic but tested positive. Another study, also released on Friday by the C.D.C., found that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protected hospitalized youngsters between the ages of 12 and 18 against severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C, which can develop two to six weeks after infection with the virus.  The study looked at 24 hospitals in 20 states between July and Dec. 9, 2021, during the period when the Delta variant was dominant. It concluded that vaccination had an efficacy rate of 91 percent against MIS-C, and noted that among 38 hospitalized patients aged 12 to 18 who required life support, all were unvaccinated."

Liu, 16, finished third in the short program at nationals on Thursday and was hoping that a strong showing in Friday’s free skate would strengthen her chances of making the Olympic team. Her fate now is in the hands of U.S. Figure Skating officials, who on Saturday will announce the U.S. women’s team headed to Beijing. They will pick the three female single skaters based on their body of work over the past year — not just on how they finish at nationals. That’s great news for Liu. She is one of the top-ranked American women and finished in the top five of both of her Grand Prix events this season. Later Friday, another contender for the Olympic team, Amber Glenn, tested positive and withdrew from nationals, depriving her of a last chance to impress the Olympic selection committee. She said she was experiencing symptoms. On Instagram, Liu — the senior national champion in 2019 and 2020 — wrote that she was fully vaccinated, had been wearing an N95 mask and twice tested negative before arriving at nationals. “Things happen unfortunately, but it is what it is,” she wrote of her positive test, adding that she felt good physically and mentally. She did not mention whether she was experiencing any symptoms of the virus. Liu was the second high-profile American skater to test positive at nationals. Brandon Frazier, who, with Alexa Knierim, is the reigning national pairs champion, withdrew from nationals on Wednesday after waking up feeling ill and then testing positive. “Although my symptoms are pretty bad, nothing sucks more than not being able to compete,” Frazier said on social media. Knierim wrote: “We have taken all the necessary precautions leading up to these championships, including but not limited to social distancing, the use of KN95 masks and canceling all holiday gatherings as well as private lessons at the rink, so it has been shocking and devastating for us to process what has happened.”  After testing positive on Friday morning, Glenn, who finished 14th in the short program and was among the top four women vying for the Olympic team, wrote on social media that she was heartbroken to withdraw from nationals after feeling sick: “Over the last 48hrs I progressively became slower, weak & sluggish… I thought it was the usual competition nerves and maybe allergies but after yesterday’s performance & the last two days of practices not feeling like myself at all I had a sinking feeling it was something more.”  And in part of her Instagram post that was later deleted, she said, ““To know I was competing while sick with covid is awful.” U.S. Figure Skating will announce the United States’ two Olympic pairs teams on Sunday, and Frazier and Knierim said they have petitioned to be selected for the Beijing Games."

Around the country, school systems are wrestling with how to go back to class amid the highly contagious Omicron variant. Most have forged ahead with in-person classes, while some have pivoted to remote instruction. But nowhere has the situation been more rancorous than in Chicago, where school for hundreds of thousands of children resumed on Monday but then stopped abruptly by Wednesday, as teachers called for more virus precautions and testing while city officials said the school year should proceed in person. Families, racing to find child care, were also wrestling with all the uncertainties of what might be ahead. Would school go back in session — in person or remote — soon? Would this last into next week? How might such a tense fight between the Chicago Teachers Union and city officials reach a resolution? Yet interviews across Chicago with families of schoolchildren revealed a wide range of views on what should happen next. Some parents, worried about the fast spread of the virus, called for a temporary shift to remote learning. Others wanted an immediate return to classrooms, arguing that children have suffered in isolation through the pandemic. Still others fell somewhere in the middle, uncertain of best steps but angry about the tumult in Chicago. Five families told their stories and gave their thoughts on the standoff. The possibility of more online school for John Christie’s fourth-grade son, Ian, is enough to bring Mr. Christie to tears. Mr. Christie said his son, who has been diagnosed with autism, thrived with the schedule that in-person instruction gave him during the fall. But in earlier parts of the pandemic, when school was online, Mr. Christie said, the circumstances were dire for his son and for the family, which tried to assist him with remote school in its Pullman neighborhood on the South Side. “That was probably one of the most stressful and excruciating things that we attempted to do with him,” Mr. Christie said. “And so it’s just this building frustration right now of ‘What are our options?’” When classes were canceled on Wednesday, Mr. Christie’s wife, Lori, decided to take off from work to be with their son. They worry about what will happen next. “Schools are not health departments, they’re not epidemiologists,” Mr. Christie said. “But it’s just really, really frustrating.” Shifting back to remote school, at least for a bit, is what Alejandra Martinez sees as the best way to keep her family safe. Over the holidays, she said, her entire family contracted the virus after her youngest son, a preschooler, was exposed. She said she worried that a return to school might bring new cases of the virus; she was especially concerned about another son, a first grader with asthma, as well as the boys’ grandmother, who lives next door. Ms. Martinez, who stays at home with her children, said she had the time and resources to help her children with their studies if they were to go back online. The downside, she said, is that her sons complain about missing their classmates and teachers in online school. But she said she preferred that to the possibility that a loved one would become gravely ill. Teachers, Ms. Martinez said, deserve the support of families. “They’re running multiple jobs that are not their job title,” Ms. Martinez said. “Being nurses, being counselors, being a therapist. Being a second parent to these kids, and sometimes their only parent.” For some parents, like Teffany Akins, emotions were far more mixed. Ms. Akins, who has two daughters — one in kindergarten and another in fourth grade — said she believed that if children were vaccinated and wore masks, they should be able to safely stay in school. Ending in-person school, she said, will not stop the virus’s spread. “I don’t believe that kids going remote is going to give them the reduction in cases that they’re thinking it will give,” she said. When schools were online earlier in the pandemic, Ms. Akins and her husband struggled to find enough space in their home in the city’s Bronzeville neighborhood to work. Making sure their daughters were paying attention in virtual school only added to the chaos. It was hard, Ms. Akins said, to watch her children lag behind socially and academically. Ms. Akins said that she supported teachers but that she was also talking to other parents about their fears of going remote again. “I’m a union worker myself,” Ms. Akins said. “But at the same time, I really wish it was a more organized approach to going remote than just deciding that we’re not going to show up for school.” All the uncertainty was upending Laura Lynch’s household. She said she could manage a shift to remote learning for her fourth-grade son, if need be, but she wished the school system had executed matters differently. “They had plenty of time to lay down the sandbags to prepare for higher numbers,” she said of the surge in cases across Chicago. “So I’m a little bit disappointed that they didn’t have a plan in place if there was a spike.” Ms. Lynch said she would favor a short-term shift to remote learning for several weeks until cases diminish. Still, she worried about the effects on her son. “He would pace like a tiger in the zoo in too small of a cage,” she said of earlier periods of online learning. Still, she said, she and her family are in a much better situation than many families. Her schedule is flexible because she is in nursing school, and her husband works from their home in the Garfield Park neighborhood. Such a change would be an added burden, Ms. Lynch said. But they could manage. Whatever solution comes should come quickly — and be short term, said Aaron Wise, who worries that his two high school children are missing out on important parts of their adolescence. Another stint of online learning — rather than in-person classes — would be trying, but if it was brief and solved the problem, he said, it would be better than just ignoring the problem. “It seems like a small price to pay to get everybody healthy, or a way larger majority of people healthy,” he said. Mr. Wise’s children, said Mr. Wise, who lives in the Avondale neighborhood, can take care of themselves if school were to return to virtual learning. His only worry is the social interaction they are missing out on — and some of the milestones his elder child, a senior, would not get. “They’re not seeing their friends, which is why you want to be in school when you’re a kid,” he said. “They’re way less active. Their diets are worse. You feel like a shut-in.” Testing before the effort to return to school this week was bungled, he said. His younger child, he said, took a test that had been provided for students to take before he realized that he did not know where to send it. Most of the roughly 150,000 mail-in P.C.R. tests given to students in Chicago were never returned. Of the 40,000 or so tests that were mailed in, most produced invalid results. Mr. Wise said that it felt like the testing program had been a waste of time, money and resources, but that the teachers were reasonable to call for a stronger testing program for safety. He said he could not understand why officials had not agreed to that. “I feel like there’s a lot of political stuff going on,” he said. “It’s hard, the situation is difficult. But it really shouldn’t be that difficult.”"

Algunas dijeron que sus periodos se retrasaron. Otras informaron sobre un sangrado más abundante de lo habitual o de un sangrado doloroso. Algunas mujeres posmenopáusicas que no habían tenido la menstruación en años, dijeron incluso que habían vuelto a menstruar. Un estudio publicado el jueves descubrió que los ciclos menstruales de las mujeres sí cambiaron tras la vacunación contra el coronavirus. Quienes escribieron el estudio informaron que las mujeres inoculadas tenían ciclos menstruales ligeramente más largos después de recibir la vacuna que las no vacunadas. Sin embargo, sus periodos, que llegaban casi un día más tarde que el promedio, no se prolongaban, y el efecto era transitorio, ya que la duración de los ciclos volvía a la normalidad en uno o dos meses. Por ejemplo, alguien con un ciclo menstrual de 28 días que comienza con siete días de sangrado seguiría teniendo un periodo de siete días, pero el ciclo duraría 29 días. El ciclo termina cuando comienza el siguiente periodo y volvería a ser de 28 días uno o dos meses después. El retraso fue más pronunciado en las mujeres que recibieron las dos dosis de la vacuna durante el mismo ciclo menstrual. Los investigadores descubrieron que estas mujeres tenían la menstruación dos días más tarde de lo habitual. El estudio, publicado en la revista Obstetrics & Gynecology, es uno de los primeros en respaldar los informes anecdóticos de mujeres que afirman que sus ciclos menstruales se retrasaron después de la vacunación, dijo Hugh Taylor, director del departamento de obstetricia, ginecología y ciencias de la reproducción de la Escuela de Medicina de Yale. “Valida que hay algo real”, dijo Taylor, quien ha oído hablar de ciclos irregulares de sus pacientes. Al mismo tiempo, añadió, los cambios observados en el estudio no eran significativos y parecían ser transitorios. “Quiero asegurarme de que disuadimos a la gente de esos mitos falsos que andan por ahí sobre los efectos en la fertilidad”, dijo Taylor. “Un ciclo o dos en los que los periodos se desvían pueden ser molestos, pero no van a ser perjudiciales desde el punto de vista médico”. Su mensaje es diferente para las mujeres posmenopáusicas que experimentan sangrado o manchado vaginal, ya sea después de la vacunación o no, a quienes advierte que pueden tener una condición médica grave y deben ser evaluadas por un médico. Un grave inconveniente del estudio, que se centró en residentes en Estados Unidos, es que la muestra no es representativa a nivel nacional y no puede generalizarse a la población en general. Los datos fueron proporcionados por una empresa llamada Natural Cycles, que tiene una aplicación para el seguimiento de la fertilidad. Sus usuarias tienen más probabilidades de ser blancas y con estudios universitarios que la población estadounidense en general; también son más delgadas que el promedio de las mujeres estadounidenses —el peso puede afectar a la menstruación— y no usan anticonceptivos hormonales. Las mujeres en edad fértil encontrarán que los hallazgos son tranquilizadores, dijo Diana Bianchi, médica y directora del Instituto Nacional Eunice Kennedy Shriver de Salud Infantil y Desarrollo Humano (NICHD, por su sigla en inglés). (La Oficina de Investigación sobre la Salud de la Mujer de los Institutos Nacionales de Salud y el NICHD ayudaron a financiar el estudio, así como proyectos de investigación relacionados en la Universidad de Boston, la Escuela de Medicina de Harvard, la Johns Hopkins y la Universidad Estatal de Michigan). “Sus proveedores de servicios médicos pueden decir: ‘Si tienes un día extra, es normal, no es algo de lo cual preocuparse”, dijo Bianchi. El estudio lo llevaron a cabo investigadores en la Universidad Oregón Health & Science y la Escuela de Medicina Warren Alpert de la Universidad de Brown, en una colaboración con investigadores de Natural Cycles, cuya aplicación utilizan millones de mujeres en todo el mundo. La data sin identificar de usuarias que dieron su consentimiento para que su información fuera incorporada a la investigación brindó una gran cantidad de evidencia sobre el modo en que los ciclos de las mujeres cambiaron durante la pandemia. Los investigadores examinaron los registros de casi 4000 mujeres que habían monitoreado meticulosamente su menstruación en tiempo real, entre ellas 2400 que se vacunaron contra el coronavirus y unas 1550 que no estaban vacunadas. Todas eran residentes de Estados Unidos de entre 18 y 45 años que habían llevado registro de sus periodos menstruales durante al menos seis meses. Para las vacunadas, los investigadores revisaron los tres ciclos previos y posteriores a la vacuna en búsqueda de cambios y los compararon con una duración similar de seis meses en las mujeres que no fueron vacunadas. En general, la vacunación se asoció con un cambio en la longitud del ciclo menor a un día entero, en promedio, luego de ambas dosis de la vacuna, en comparación con los ciclos prevacunación. El grupo sin vacunación no experimentó cambios significativos a lo largo de los seis meses. Estudios futuros de la base de datos van a examinar otros aspectos de la menstruación, como si los periodos fueron más abundantes o dolorosos luego de la vacuna. Los hallazgos del nuevo estudio puede que no se apliquen por igual a todas las mujeres. En efecto, gran parte del cambio en la duración del ciclo fue impulsado por un pequeño grupo de 380 mujeres vacunadas que experimentaron un cambio de al menos dos días en su ciclo, dijo Alison Edelman, profesora de obstetricia y ginecología en la Universidad Oregon Health & Science y autora principal del artículo. Algunas mujeres que se vacunaron tuvieron ciclos que duraron ocho días más de lo habitual, algo que es considerado clínicamente significativo, dijo Edelman. “Aunque la duración del ciclo en cuanto a la población fue de menos de un día de diferencia, para una persona eso podría ser algo importante, dependiendo de su perspectiva y del motivo por el que confían en su menstruación”, dijo. “Puedes estar esperando un embarazo, preocupada por un embarazo, puede que te hayas puesto pantalones blancos”. No está claro el motivo por el que el ciclo menstrual podría verse afectado por la vacunación, pero la mayoría de las mujeres con periodos regulares experimentan ocasionalmente algún periodo inusual o ausente. Las hormonas que secretan el hipotálamo, la glándula pituitaria y los ovarios regulan el ciclo menstrual y pueden verse afectadas por factores ambientales, estresores y cambios vitales. (Los cambios observados en el estudio no fueron causados por condiciones relacionadas con la pandemia, dijeron las autoras, dado que las mujeres en el grupo sin vacunar también vivían en tiempos pandémicos). No se sabe si es que otras vacunas impactan en la menstruación pues por lo general los ensayos clínicos de vacunas y terapias no monitorean los puntos de datos, a no ser que los investigadores estén probando anticonceptivos o potenciadores de fertilidad o busquen descartar un embarazo. “Esperamos que esta experiencia aliente a los fabricantes de vacunas y a los ensayos clínicos de terapéutica a hacer preguntas sobre el ciclo menstrual, del mismo modo que se incluyen otros signos vitales”, dijo Bianchi. La información, indicó Edelman, es importante, al igual que conocer si después de una vacuna es posible experimentar dolor de cabeza o desarrollar fiebre. “Las personas que menstrúan pasan una semana de cada mes, a veces más, lidiando con la menstruación”, dijo Edelman. “Si sumas el tiempo a lo largo de 40 años, son prácticamente diez años de menstruación”."

But while pouring tons of salt on roads makes winter driving safer, it also has damaging environmental and health consequences, according to a growing body of research. As snow and ice melt on roads, the salt washes into soil, lakes and streams, in some cases contaminating drinking water reservoirs and wells. It has killed or endangered wildlife in freshwater ecosystems, with high chloride levels toxic to fish, bugs and amphibians, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. “It’s an issue that requires attention now,” said Bill Hintz, an assistant professor in the environmental sciences department at the University of Toledo and the lead author of a recent research review published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment. “There’s plenty of scientific evidence to suggest that freshwater ecosystems are being contaminated by salt from the use of things like road salt beyond the concentration which is safe for freshwater organisms and for human consumption,” Dr. Hintz said. Salt has been used to de-ice roads in the United States since the 1930s, and its use across the country has tripled in the past 50 years, Dr. Hintz said. More than 20 million metric tons of salt are poured on U.S. roads each winter, according to an estimate by the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in New York, and the environmental costs are growing. Still, little has been done to address the environmental impact of road salt because it is cheap and effective, said Victoria Kelly, the environmental programming manager at the Cary Institute. By lowering the freezing temperature of water, salt prevents snow from turning to ice and melts ice that is already there. Road salt is made from sodium chloride, the same chemical found in table salt. Of all salt consumed in the United States, about 43 percent is used for highway de-icing, according to the U.S. Geological Survey in 2020. The consequences of insufficiently salting roads were seen this week, when hundreds of drivers were stranded by a snowstorm on Interstate 95 in Virginia. Officials said the storm began with rain, which washed away road salt and made it difficult to keep roads clear. More snow fell in the Mid-Atlantic States and the Northeast on Friday. But environmentalists say the problems associated with road salt are getting harder to ignore. Ms. Kelly said the accumulation of salt in drinking water reservoirs in some places was harming people on low-sodium diets. A 2018 study of wells in Dutchess County, N.Y., found that sodium concentration in wells reached levels as high as 860 milligrams per liter — much higher than the federal and state recommendation that levels not exceed 20 milligrams per liter for people on very low-sodium diets and 270 milligrams per liter for people on moderately restricted sodium diets. A separate 2018 study in the journal Environmental Science and Technology showed that 24 percent of private drinking wells in New York were contaminated with salt that had been used on roads. About 15 percent of people in the United States get their water from private ground wells, while the rest rely on community water systems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More counties and states are rethinking the amount of salt they use because of the associated costs. Last month, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York announced appointments to the Adirondack Road Salt Reduction Task Force, established to review road-salt contamination. “I have no doubt that this group of individuals will work tirelessly to protect our state from the adverse effects of road salt,” Ms. Hochul said. “We look forward to seeing this group finally convene and make progress in preventing further pollution to our waterways and our environment.” There are consequences for wildlife, too. Dr. Hintz said his review showed that elevated salinity levels in freshwater ecosystems had already caused a reduction in the abundance and growth of freshwater organisms and a reduction in their reproduction outputs. Road salt also corrodes vehicles and bridges, causing $5 billion in annual repairs in the United States, according to an estimate by the Environmental Protection Agency. AAA suggests drivers wash and clean their vehicles regularly during winter to help offset the effects of road salt and to limit driving when salt and other de-icing chemicals are at their highest concentrations. In Britain, the Salt Association said that salt was the cheapest form of de-icing material and that it had a low environmental impact when used responsibly. “As with all highway maintenance activities, there are environmental implications from winter road maintenance,” the organization said in a statement. “Highways depots, spreading vehicles and the de-icing agent all contribute, but with good management, this burden can be minimized.” While there is not a perfect solution to the issue, there are alternatives that can significantly reduce salt usage without compromising driver safety. One method involves treating roads before storms with a salt brine solution, which can lead to a 75 percent reduction in the amount of salt used while keeping roads just as safe, according to the Cary Institute. Building better salt storage sites can also minimize waste. Some counties, like Jefferson County, Wis., have already made changes. Bill Kern, the county’s highway commissioner, said switching to a brine solution had enabled the county to cut its salt use by up to 60 percent since 2018 without an increase in the number of accidents. By using less salt, the county has reduced its overall cost for winter maintenance of state and county highways by 20 percent since 2018, saving about $1.6 million, Mr. Kern said. Over the past decade, some states, including Rhode Island, have passed legislation aimed to reduce their use of road salt and have increasingly applied a brine solution to roads in winter, but environmentalists say more needs to be done. While engineers have developed better alternatives, they have not been widely implemented in part because they require upfront costs for purchasing equipment, Ms. Kelly said. “It’ll save us money, and it’ll help to save our freshwater,” she said, while adding that “because of that legacy effect, it’s going to take a really long time to see the impact of the steps we take.”"

She was 71. Her cousin Sherrie Russell-Brown said the cause was complications of Alzheimer’s disease. Descended from a long line of lawyers, Ms. Guinier made her name in the 1980s as an unorthodox thinker about whether America’s legal institutions, even after the civil rights revolution of the 1960s, needed to change further to realize true democracy. She argued, for example, that the principle of “one person, one vote” was insufficient in a system where the interests of minorities, racial or otherwise, were inevitably trampled by those of the majority, and that alternatives needed to be considered to give more weight to minority interests. Ms. Guinier was a 43-year-old professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School when President Clinton nominated her for the post of assistant attorney general for civil rights. But she quickly came under fire from Republicans for her progressive views on voting rights and quotas. Her work was not without its liberal critics: Some scholars questioned whether her ideas about voting were in fact democratic, as she claimed, and several Democratic senators voiced their concerns about her nomination to President Clinton. But her Republican opponents also made clear that their campaign was a matter of opportunity. Still stinging from the Supreme Court nomination battles over Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas, they were looking for payback, and saw her liberal views as an opportunity to hit the president early in his term. “Clinton has not had to expend any political capital on the issue of quotas,” Clint Bolick, a conservative lawyer and activist who helped lead the charge against her, told The New York Times in 1993, “and with her, we believe we could inflict a heavy political cost.” Mr. Clinton eventually bowed to pressure and withdrew her nomination in June 1993, calling some of her positions “anti-democratic.” Ms. Guinier returned to teaching. She also wrote a memoir about her nomination experience, “Lift Every Voice: Turning a Civil Rights Setback Into a New Vision of Social Justice,” published in 1998. That same year, she moved to Harvard Law School, where she became the first woman of color to receive tenure. While the rest of the country remembered her for her failed nomination, she continued to make strides as a legal scholar and teacher. She pioneered research on implicit bias in the classroom and workplace. Later in her career she opened a wide-ranging critique of merit, especially the way it distorts institutions like her own. Many of her positions have since moved into and informed the mainstream, especially her criticisms of voter redistricting processes. “The ability to see so far down the line was her gift,” Heather Gerken, the dean of Yale Law School, said in a phone interview. “She had a deep understanding of the insidious ways that power corrupts institutions, even institutions acting in good faith.” Carol Lani Guinier was born on April 19, 1950, in Manhattan and grew up in Queens. Her mother, Eugenia (Paprin) Guinier, was a civil rights activist. Her paternal grandfather and her father, Ewart Guinier, were both lawyers, and her father also served as chairman of what was then the Department of Afro-American Studies at Harvard. Ms. Guinier recalled first wanting to become a civil rights attorney when she was 12, watching on television as Constance Baker Motley, a lawyer with the N.A.A.C.P., helped escort James Meredith in his fight to integrate the University of Mississippi in 1962. She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1971 and Yale Law School in 1974, a year behind Mr. Clinton and in the same class as Clarence Thomas. Ms. Guinier married Nolan Bowie, a fellow professor and legal scholar, in 1986. He survives her, as do her sisters, Clotilde Guinier Stenson, Sary Guinier and Marie Guinier; her son, Nikolas Bowie, also a law professor at Harvard; her stepdaughter, Dana Rice; and a granddaughter. After a clerkship with a U.S. District Court judge in Michigan and a year working with juvenile offenders in Detroit, Ms. Guinier moved to Washington to work in the Department of Justice. She left in 1981, when President Ronald Reagan took office, and for most of that decade she led the Voting Rights Project of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Ms. Guinier became an aggressive litigator, traveling, for example, in 1985 to Alabama, where, with Deval Patrick, the future governor of Massachusetts, she helped lead the defense in a voting rights case against Jeff Sessions, the future senator and attorney general who was then a U.S. attorney. Her team won an acquittal. “She was easily one of the most innovative thinkers in the voting rights space,” Sherrilyn Ifill, the outgoing head of the Legal Defense Fund, said in a phone interview. Ms. Guinier left the defense fund for a position at the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1989. There she began to turn her experience defending voting rights into ideas about how to reform the system. She argued, for example, that merely having a vote was not enough for minorities, especially those from oppressed classes. She proposed a variety of alternatives, like cumulative voting, in which people get a number of votes to distribute as they wish — a process that might allow minority voters to concentrate their support on a single candidate and in that way increase their influence as a bloc. “Her concern was that each vote count the same as the next vote, and the normal districting process does not create that,” Gerald Torres, a professor at Yale Law School and a frequent collaborator, said by phone. Such ideas caught the attention of the Clinton administration, whose officials also liked her fiery rhetoric about the backsliding on voting rights under the Reagan and George Bush administrations. It was perhaps inevitable, then, that her Justice Department nomination would become a lightning rod. She insisted that her positions had been taken out of context, and she noted that cumulative voting was already used in communities around the country. But Republicans doubled down, calling her a “quota queen” for, they said, supporting affirmative action quotas (she did not). Still, Ms. Guinier seemed to take the president’s decision to withdraw her name in stride — especially since it had made her something of a national figure. “When I walk through the train to the snack bar, many people seem to recognize me — and these are men, women, whites, Blacks, Republicans, Democrats,” she told The New York Times in 1993. “People come up and say, ‘I disagree with everything you have said, but I think you should have had a hearing, and I admire the way you handled the situation.’” Above all, she said, she appreciated the perspective that the process gave her and the insights she was able to take with her back to the academy, among them an understanding of how political polarization got in the way of democratic decision making. She also became known for her innovations in the classroom, said Susan Sturm, a professor at Columbia Law School and a frequent collaborator. Ms. Guinier would bring in drama students to help her class construct short plays around legal questions, or hand over a lesson to a group of students. She wrote a number of books, on topics as varied as voting rights, gender equality and affirmative action, including “The Tyranny of the Majority: Fundamental Fairness in Representative Democracy” (1994); Who’s Qualified?: A New Democracy Forum on the Future of Affirmative Action” (2001), with Ms. Sturm; and “The Tyranny of the Meritocracy: Democratizing Higher Education in America” (2016)."

Kathy Hochul said on Friday, as hospitals contend with crippling staff shortages amid the Omicron wave. The state is averaging about 70,000 new cases daily and is experiencing an alarming rise in hospitalizations, particularly of unvaccinated children. “We’ve already seen what’s been happening in our health care environments,” Ms. Hochul said. “Staff is getting sick, they’re leaving. We need them to get well, we need them to have the best fortification they possibly can, and that means getting a booster shot.” The governor said that the state health commissioner, Mary Bassett, would recommend the change to a state advisory council on Tuesday, and that they anticipated “swift approval.” The requirement would apply to all health care workers who do not have a valid medical exemption. Ms. Hochul also indicated that she would require visitors to nursing homes to wear “surgical-type” masks and show proof of a negative test. The State Health Department released a report on Friday showing that pediatric hospital admissions had shot up from 70 per week at the beginning of December to 571 per week by the end of the month. In New York City, they went from 22 per week to 385, and the number increased nearly tenfold in the Mid-Hudson area and on Long Island. The report found that hospitalizations were increasing faster for children than for adults, Dr. Eli Rosenberg, deputy director for science in the Health Department’s Office of Public Health, noted in an interview. Seventy percent of newly admitted children who tested positive for the virus were experiencing symptoms, and half had no comorbidities. “We’re very concerned about this alarming increase,” Dr. Rosenberg said, adding that there had been a dangerous tendency throughout the pandemic to brush off the risks for younger patients. “What we’re trying to show is there are serious consequences for some children.” Even for children who are not hospitalized primarily because of Covid, but are found to have it after being admitted, the virus could well be an aggravating factor in their medical treatment, he said. The report underscored the importance of vaccination for eligible children and anyone around them. More than 90 percent of hospitalized children ages 5 to 11, and 65 percent of those ages 12 to 17, were unvaccinated. Statewide, 31 percent of children ages 5 to 11 have received at least one vaccine dose, and 73 percent of those ages 12 to 17 have. People under 5 are not yet eligible for vaccinations, and that is the group of children who have seen the fastest increase in hospitalizations overall. Data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday also showed a nationwide increase in the number of children 4 and younger admitted to hospitals with the virus. The longstanding advice on masks and social distancing remains as important as ever, particularly for vulnerable children, Dr. Rosenberg said. “We want everyone to double down on what we’ve been saying and take it seriously,” he said."

The bank has given staff based in the United States a deadline of Jan. 14 to submit proof of their inoculations against the coronavirus or request religious, medical or legal exemptions, according to a person familiar with the policies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Workers who do not comply with the mandate — which requires a full dose of vaccinations, not booster shots as well — will be placed on unpaid leave on Jan. 15 and fired Jan. 31, the person said. The person added that some staff might not receive year-end bonuses unless they signed documents agreeing not to sue the company. More than 90 percent of Citigroup’s 65,000 U.S. employees have complied with the requirement, the person said. Bloomberg News reported the news earlier.  Vaccine rules are a delicate issue for Wall Street firms and other large employers. JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, has not imposed a requirement, but said at the end of last year that government mandates could make it “difficult or impossible” for the company to continue to employ unvaccinated staff. Bank of America does not require inoculation as a condition of employment, either, but it has strongly encouraged staff to get vaccinations and boosters, and has asked workers to inform the company of their status.Members of the Supreme Court’s conservative majority, in arguments on Friday, seemed skeptical that the Biden administration has the legal power to mandate large employers to require coronavirus vaccinations or frequent testing. Across the nation’s biggest banks, policies around in-person work, vaccination and testing vary widely. Citigroup’s stance, which is among the strictest, is being resisted by some employees. “They’re not leaving people any choice,” Ben Shittu, a 37-year-old software engineer at Citigroup in Ireland, said in an interview Thursday. He has refused to be inoculated against the coronavirus, citing concerns about the efficacy and side effects of the new vaccines. Mr. Shittu said he had felt compelled to post a video opposing the bank’s policy after a contentious team meeting in November, during which his manager told employees that their jobs depended on getting the vaccine. Since then, Mr. Shittu said, he has been inundated with supportive messages from fellow workers. Staff members have also taken to discussing their concerns on private messaging apps as well as those operated by the bank. “What do I plan to do if Citi decides to fire me — I don’t think it’s relevant,” Mr. Shittu said. “If you lose one job, one door closes, another opportunity will always come around.” A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment on the concerns raised by Mr. Shittu. Vaccine policies and rising coronavirus cases have complicated Wall Street’s efforts to get employees back to their desks. With the Omicron variant spreading rapidly, the country is averaging more than 500,000 new coronavirus cases a day, far more than at any previous point in the pandemic. That surge has prompted banks including JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup to allow employees to work from home at the start of the year."

He was competing against Albert Finney (“Tom Jones”), Richard Harris (“This Sporting Life”), Rex Harrison (“Cleopatra”) and Paul Newman (“Hud”). When Mr. Poitier accepted an honorary Academy Award in 2002, he took a similar tack, thanking the “handful of visionary American filmmakers, directors, writers and producers” he said made his career possible by going against the odds. “Without them, this most memorable moment would not have come to pass and the many excellent young actors who have followed in admirable fashion might not have come as they have to enrich the tradition of American filmmaking as they have,” Mr. Poitier said."
