A mobile app that’s mandatory for all participants in next month’s Winter Olympics in Beijing contains security flaws that could make it easy for a hacker to steal sensitive personal information, cybersecurity researchers in Canada warn.
The China-built app, My 2022, will be used to monitor the health of attendees, as well as facilitate information sharing, leading up to and throughout the 2022 Games. Technicians with Citizen Lab, a human rights-focused cybersecurity and censorship research group at the University of Toronto, said they found the app failed to authenticate the identity of certain websites, leaving transfers of personal data open to attackers.

LONDON—The British man who took four people hostage at a synagogue in Texas had previously been investigated by the U.K.’s domestic intelligence service, according to a British security official familiar with the matter.
Malik Faisal Akram, from northern England, was the subject of a preliminary investigation in late 2020, the official said. However MI5, the U.K.’s domestic intelligence agency, determined that he didn’t present an immediate risk to national security. This left Mr. Akram free to fly to the U.S. in recent days. The 44-year-old died on Saturday after a standoff with U.S. enforcement officials in the Dallas suburb of Colleyville.

Microsoft said the transaction would make it the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind China’s  Tencent Holdings Ltd.  and Japan’s  Sony Group Corp.

These sort of payouts have long existed to a degree in the office, retail real-estate and apartment markets, especially in places like New York City and San Francisco. But they have never been so big or so commonplace as they are in urban office markets these days, real-estate brokers say.

These twin setbacks have cast a harsher spotlight on the leadership of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), the lawmaker responsible for navigating President Biden’s agenda through the 50-50 Senate after he delivered a Covid-19 aid bill early last year and a bipartisan infrastructure bill in the summer.

Both of the freshman senators have put their holdings in such a vehicle, where control over their trades is given to a trustee.

Tsunami waves at least a meter high smashed into buildings and swept away cars. The undersea cable that connects the archipelago with the rest of the world via Fiji appears to be badly damaged.

HONG KONG—China’s leaders spent much of 2021 rolling out a blizzard of new regulations aimed at addressing long-running imbalances in the economy. This year, Beijing wants to ensure the ripple effects of those moves don’t cause too much disruption.
Stability has become the top economic priority after months of dramatic actions aimed at revamping an economic model that economists say relied too much on growth from housing construction and government-led investments in infrastructure projects. Strict new limits were imposed on how much property developers could borrow, setting off a slump in the housing market, as developers stopped bidding for new land, and home buyers delayed purchases. Meanwhile, government efforts to rein in and discipline private-sector firms—from tech giants to for-profit tutoring services—spooked investors at home and abroad. Beijing also imposed tighter cybersecurity regulations that could snarl Chinese tech giants’ overseas listing plans.

IN NEW YORK designer Lucy Harris’s experience, Manhattanites tend to ask for “refined and upscale” décor, a description that suggests the sort of formal, adults-only living room children must resentfully eye from a distance. The couple who came to her for help when renovating this West Village loft, however, wanted a refined, upscale home that they and their children, ages 5 and 8, would nevertheless find familial and cozy. Said Ms. Harris, who pulled together the interior design with a colleague, senior designer Kelley Roach, “They very much wanted a grown-up space, but they did not want it to be precious.”
Traces of the space’s former life as the floor of a factory building—wrapped beams, a concrete pillar, great, gridded windows—contribute a sophisticated hipness. To keep the aesthetic spare, Ms. Harris installed a tightly edited collection of contemporary furnishings in a limited, muted palette. To a basic scheme of black, white and gray, she added earthy tones of sandy brown and blush, and the occasional jolt of saturated color for a note of childlike playfulness and adult artiness.

Mathematician Eugenia Cheng explores the uses of math beyond the classroom. Read more columns here.
As Covid continues to spread, social distancing remains important. In the studio at my gym, a grid consisting of 6-foot squares has been marked on the floor, and each person is supposed to stay in the middle of their square during class. However, it might be possible to fit more people in the room by drawing circles instead, with the second row fitting snugly in the gaps between the front row, in a lattice pattern.
 Mathematicians call this “sphere-packing,” and study how to fit spheres into a given space as tightly as possible. The three-dimensional version of this solution is the pyramid shape that has long been used for stacking oranges, cannonballs and other spherical objects. In 1611, the astronomer Johannes Kepler conjectured that this was the most efficient configuration. That might feel obvious, but it wasn’t formally proved until 2017 by mathematician Thomas Hales, with a giant computer-programming effort.
The math of sphere-packing is also related to error-correction in the field of information theory, although it takes a leap of abstraction to get there. Physical circles and spheres are defined by distance: If we record a person’s position on a two-dimensional floor, we can draw a safe 6-foot social distancing circle around them by measuring 6 feet in all directions.



“When information is slightly corrupted it is still ‘close’ to the correct information—not in terms of physical distance, but in a way that can be measured precisely. ”



Mathematicians can also think of circles and spheres in abstract space. An abstract sphere might sound confusing, but we use the term metaphorically when we talk about someone’s “sphere of influence” or “sphere of authority.” A person’s influence isn’t measured by physical distance, but we can imagine that it reaches a certain extent in all directions around them. Similarly, when information is slightly corrupted it is still “close” to the correct information—not in terms of physical distance, but in a way that can be measured precisely.

In the 1940s, mathematician Richard Hamming started devising ways for programs to detect and correct those errors. When we try to transmit a piece of information, it begins in the center of its “sphere of potential errors,” but by the time it arrives it might have shifted off-center. As long as its sphere doesn’t overlap with the sphere of another piece of information, the recipient can just “push” it back to where it is supposed to be. That’s the error-correction. 
If the spheres of different pieces of information overlapped, however, there would be an unsolvable ambiguity, since the recipient wouldn’t be able to tell which sphere each piece belonged in. One way to ensure that the error spheres don’t overlap is to position them far apart, but this would be inefficient. The methods we have for sending information are finite and limited, and the sort of information we’re transmitting today is extremely complex—not just letters and numbers but music and video. In order to be able to send more information at once, we want to pack in as many spheres as possible.
A further complication is that information isn’t just two- or three-dimensional, like a physical circle or sphere. It can have many more dimensions, and higher-dimensional spheres present packing problems that are very far from being completely solved. Pure mathematicians often try to generalize things into higher dimensions out of sheer curiosity. However, when abstract math is done well, practical applications often follow later, sometimes much later, as in the case of sphere-packing.

Omicron’s ubiquity and reduced severity are encouraging some people to drop pandemic precautions, decisions that public-health experts say present new risks for people at risk of severe Covid-19 outcomes.
People, including those who got vaccinated and boosted and curtailed their activities for months, are letting their guard down in the face of a variant that appears to be infecting everyone but causing largely mild illness. 
 This is a dangerous way of thinking, doctors and scientists say: Omicron still poses risks to more vulnerable people, including the elderly, immunocompromised and those with underlying health conditions. Some doctors say they are also worried about Omicron resulting in more long-Covid cases, which can result in lingering and worsening symptoms months after infection, as well as questions of new variants arising with such widespread infection. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages people to avoid nonessential travel and eating inside restaurants. But some people say that they are tired of waiting to reconvene with other people and the world, and that they believe the risks of the pandemic have declined.

Joseph Anderson, a 39-year-old librarian in New York City, said he spent the past two years doing everything he could to protect himself and others. He followed CDC guidelines and got Covid-19 vaccinations as soon as they were available. In December, Mr. Anderson, his wife and 11-month-old son all contracted Covid-19 and spent Christmas in isolation with mild, flulike symptoms. He and his wife considered canceling their son’s first birthday party this past Saturday, but after recovering from Covid-19, they chose not to hold back.
“When you’re scared about something for so long and then it finally happens, you kind of feel almost a sense of relief,” he says.






Joseph Anderson and his family spent Christmas in isolation with mild, flulike Covid-19 symptoms.

Mr. Anderson plans to socialize and travel sooner rather than later, while his immunity from his vaccinations and recent infection is likely to be the strongest. He is planning a family trip to see his brother in New Orleans.
“I kind of feel like after getting vaccinated and boosted and contracting it that I’m as protected as I can possibly be as a person right now,” he says.
Karen Edwards, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Irvine says the threat of Covid-19 means you should avoid eating and drinking in public if you can. More interactions between potentially infected people will give the virus more pathways to spread and potentially mutate, she says. 
“If we had a variant that caused severe disease like Delta and was as transmissible as Omicron, we wouldn’t want to see that,” Dr. Edwards says.

More transmission also threatens immunocompromised people, Dr. Edwards says. “They may be vaccinated and boosted and because of their underlying disease or medications they’re taking, their immune system is not going to react in the same way that a healthy individual’s would,” she says.
Anyone who is infected can transmit Covid-19 to people for whom Omicron might present more of a threat without knowing it, says Michael Lin, an infectious-disease physician at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.
“It’s not mild to moderate for everybody,” Dr. Lin says.
Eman Rimawi-Doster, 37, who has lupus and had one leg amputated above the knee eight years ago, said she lives every day anxious that she will catch Omicron.
“I don’t want to be a victim of Covid, and there’s no way for me to prevent it except to stay in the house,” says Ms. Rimawi-Doster, who works for a nonprofit civil-rights law firm in New York City.

Ms. Rimawi-Doster, who is fully vaccinated and boosted, said she has lost some three dozen friends to Covid-19, some of whom didn’t have pre-existing conditions.
“If completely healthy people are dying from this, what chance do I have?” Ms. Rimawi-Doster says. “People don’t think that disability is something that will ever affect their lives personally. But anybody can join the club at any time.”
Another reason to avoid Omicron, doctors say, is that with previous variants, even mild to moderate cases sometimes resulted in long Covid, which is when people experience persistent and often worsening symptoms after an infection.
Long Covid affects roughly 10% to 30% of people with Covid-19, research suggests. Also sometimes called long-haul Covid, it has been associated with symptoms including cognitive problems, extreme fatigue, a racing heart rate and shortness of breath that can last for many months and even years.
While it is too early to know if Omicron will generate a whole new set of long Covid patients, experts say there is no reason to think it won’t.

“The majority of our patients in the long-haul clinics had very mild illness to begin with,” says Greg Vanichkachorn, an occupational and aerospace medicine physician at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who works with long-Covid patients in the first three months after their infection. “One of my greatest fears is that these patients that are now experiencing these mild cases may go on to have long-haul Covid. If that is the case with so many people getting sick, we could have this tsunami of long-haul cases in a few weeks or months.”
Dr. Vanichkachorn says the clinic has seen a few patients infected with Omicron who are struggling with symptoms about three weeks after their initial infection. He recommends that if patients haven’t recovered two or three weeks after an infection they should seek medical care.
Eddie Stenehjem, an infectious-diseases doctor at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, understands why people are yearning to live a post-Covid-19 life but warns that it is too soon. Without clinical studies and extensive data, it cannot be determined that prior infection to Omicron is going to be protective against other variants of concern like Delta, Dr. Stenehjem says.

“We need to make sacrifices right now to protect the vulnerable population,” Dr. Stenehjem says.
Misha Mutizwa, a 38-year-old dermatologist in the Philadelphia area, believes people with different risk profiles should adopt different behaviors, while Omicron is circulating. He hasn’t had Covid-19, is fully vaccinated and boosted and feels comfortable living most of his life as he did before the pandemic.
“We should have options available for those of us who are ready to safely and thoughtfully start to transition back into a relatively normal life,” Dr. Mutizwa says.
As a physician, Dr. Mutizwa wears masks at work and other places they are required. But he has been traveling for leisure and doesn’t plan on slowing down. He selected Panama as a recent destination, in part because of the country’s high vaccination rates.
“I think at some point we have to move forward as a society because this idea of indefinite masking and restrictions on folks is psychologically burdensome,” Dr. Mutizwa says.











          To fight Omicron surges, some countries are handing out second booster shots. In Israel, early data suggest a fourth vaccine dose can increase protection against Covid-19, but scientists aren’t sure how long it can last and some say additional boosters won’t help.

It’s virtually impossible at the moment to hire anyone to do any repair, maintenance or construction work on your home, no matter how badly you need it. Right now, repair people are like the hottest kids in high school. Remember them? They were attractive. They had godlike skills at pretty much everything. The whole school envied them. They were utterly unattainable. And you, the pimply-faced freshman, stood by and looked on with a heart full of yearning as they strutted confidently past you toward their lockers.
Back then, you knew better than to just call up one of these high school hotties and say “I need you now.” And you shouldn’t do it with your repair or maintenance person either because you’ll get the same result. The good news is that the techniques that actually worked to attract the attention of the Prom King or Queen also work when attempting to secure the services of your local professional repair person.

I’VE BEEN teaching cooking classes for about a decade, and one of my favorites is cheesemaking. In the most basic class we start with the simplest cheese, ricotta. Seeing it come together for the first time invariably inspires an audible reaction, often an “Oh, wow.” Liquid turns into solid, right in front of your eyes. It’s science, but it sure does look like magic.
Cheesemaking starts with curdling milk, and that can be achieved through a couple of different means. Many of the world’s greatest cheeses—Camemberts, fetas, cheddars—rely on bacteria to metabolize the milk and create acids, which lower the pH to the point where curds separate from whey. We’ve all seen this happen by mistake, in our refrigerators, when the milk goes bad. You could absolutely strain that curd out and make cheese with it, but the bacteria in your fridge probably don’t produce delicious aromatic compounds the way certain more desirable bacteria do.

In its advertisements, Arc’teryx—a 33-year-old North Vancouver outdoor-gear company—shows its hardy outfits being worn on powder-drenched ski slopes and verdant forest trails. But lately, Arc’teryx consumers can’t seem to stop wearing the brand’s jackets in a far less extreme setting: their showers. On the video app TikTok, you can more than a hundred clips of people showering in Arc’teryx’s Gore-Tex jackets, with their cloaked heads and shoulders planted directly beneath a flowing showerhead. These clips are weirdly mesmerizing. Many commenters voice the same observation, that the water “just beads right off” the jackets (that exact wording has become meme-ified, becoming part of the in-joke). These videos are almost always set to “Arc’teryx,” an infectious 2021 song by British rapper YT, that opens with the swaggering lyrics: “Arc’teryx on me, nah, we don’t rock no Patagonia. Arc’teryx on me, I could go hiking in Snowdonia.”
What’s possibly the first such video was posted in May of last year by Jason Allred, 28, a quality control manager and nature photographer in Salt Lake City, Utah. He had just purchased a $599 Arc’teryx Alpha AR model, which the brand bills as being waterproof, and wanted to test out the jacket’s technical claims. So, he recorded a few clips to send to friends. In them, he runs the sleeve under a faucet, dumps a glass of water on the hood, then hops in the shower and finally, leaps into a pool. His friends were so entertained by the progressively rigorous testing in his videos (which took him just a few hours to shoot) that he compiled them into one clip and uploaded it to TikTok. The video, which is like a Benny Hill sketch refreshed for the gorpcore moment, has over three million views and, as it snowballed, copycat TikToks proliferated.

Did you watch the final minutes of the Cowboys-Niners playoff on Sunday? I’m not quite sure what I saw. I wouldn’t call it great football. I’m not sure I would even call it football. It was a lot of downtime: whistles, penalties, reviews, slow-motion, time outs, and ultimately, a game official careening into the backside of the Cowboys quarterback as time expired and a winnable game for Dallas slipping away. 
“Not football” is what NFL football often is, of course. This newspaper helped popularize the knowledge that an average professional football game contains very little actual action—10 minutes, 43 seconds was the determination a decade or so ago. The rest is fill, the Styrofoam peanuts in between: commercials, replays, coaching, huddling, officials mulling, Tony Romo fretting, Jim Nantz Jim Nantzing.

As the Covid-19 pandemic enters its third year, the world is settling in for the moment the disease becomes endemic—and less disruptive—at least in the U.S. Against that is the race to vaccinate while anticipating new variants. 
The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 has continued to turn up winning numbers in the evolutionary lottery, alighting on mutations that can help it survive and thrive. With uneven Covid-19 vaccine uptake in the developed world and slow rollout in poorer nations, virologists say the virus has ample avenues to generate more variants that could challenge immune defenses developed through vaccination, infection or both.

They have since returned to a changed landscape. The tropical coastline popular with surfers and snorkelers, was ravaged by the tsunami, which caused ocean swells as far away as the U.S. West Coast and Japan. The nearby Kanokupolu village was severely damaged.

AMONG THE many social media tributes that circulated after Joan Didion’s death last month was one featuring a photo of the writer seated at her typewriter, the ne plus ultra of stylish intellectualism in a black turtleneck. She posed in a similar garment for her 1989 Gap ad, and although the turtleneck did not make Didion’s famous packing list, it should have. It has the same spare, incisive form she demonstrated in both her prose and her dress.
More pragmatically, turtlenecks are cozy and reassuringly classic. Perhaps that’s why so many brands—from Givenchy, Paco Rabanne and Prada to Officine Générale, Alex Mill and Ann Mashburn—enthusiastically endorsed high-neck knitwear this season, rendering it in both strong hues and allover patterns. It’s a trend that’s been building since Raf Simons put brightly colored turtlenecks on the Calvin Klein runway in 2017.

ONE MORNING last October, Maynard Villaflores, 24, set his alarm for 5:55 a.m. Snoozing was not an option: At 6 a.m., New York brand Telfar was dropping a limited number of its coveted unisex handbags online. “Within two minutes the bags [would] be sold out,” said Mr. Villaflores, a social-media manager in Portland, Ore. He snapped up a mini olive number that he now wears across his chest. “The rush and [hype around the drop] reminds me of buying Jordans,” he said.
Mr. Villaflores is not the only man to liken bags to kicks. For the past decade, men have feverishly collected sneakers, nerding out over exclusive styles. Some brandish them on sidewalks while others see them as investments, keeping them box-fresh until resale. Rare models fetch dizzying sums on online marketplaces like StockX and at auction. (Just last year, Sotheby’s sold Kanye West’s Nike Air Yeezy 1 Prototype for $1.8 million.) Because of their sport and streetwear connotations, “sneakers helped break the stigma” that an interest in fashion was inherently feminine, said Jian DeLeon, Nordstrom’s men’s fashion director. “[Now], it’s OK for guys to obsess over accessories.” Recently, another men’s accessory has begun inspiring sneaker-level fervor: cross-body bags that cling to the torso like a baby monkey. Sold by brands like Fendi, Prada and Stüssy, such bags convey as much savvy and élan as a new pair of Salomons.

In 2021 the United States Postal Service booked a $4.9 billion net loss. The USPS also reports that it has more than $120 billion in unfunded liabilities in pensions, retiree health benefits and other debts. To conserve cash, the agency has quit making payments on some of these obligations, and its perennial deficits likely portend a default.
The sources of the agency’s long-standing fiscal challenges are straightforward: weak revenues, high costs. The USPS’s revenues last year were only $2 billion more than in 2008. Mail volume has slid 40% over the past 15 years. Were it not for e-commerce flooding the agency with parcels, the Post Office might have gone bankrupt already.

‘Follow the science,” we keep hearing, but sometimes scientists and the media present findings in a misleading way. Consider a new study by Duke University’s ABC Science Collaborative, conducted in partnership with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. Researchers examined the effect of a “test to stay” approach to schoolchildren identified as “close contacts” of Covid-positive people. Test to stay excuses these children from quarantining if they test negative for the virus. The study’s primary conclusion was that test to stay is a good way to move away from lengthy quarantine.
That’s reasonable and useful. But the researchers peppered their report with rhetorical sleights of hand aimed at misleading readers into other, less well-founded conclusions that were mostly inevitable products of their own study design. One of their primary conclusions is that “in schools with universal masking, test-to-stay is an effective strategy.” That invites readers to assume that test-to-stay doesn’t work without forced masking. But since they studied no unmasked schools, this conclusion is baseless. An honest report would either have said so or not mentioned masking at all.

VIDEOS OF Gen Z-ers and millennials—and their cats—may saturate TikTok, but spend enough time scrolling around the social media app and you’ll find yourself led to more surprising realms. Take the travel feeds, which offer a stream of fresh footage shot just about anywhere in the world. Type #travel in the search box and you can watch waterfalls gush in Iceland, elk amble across Wyoming, sunsets unfold in South Tyrol or hungry turtles on the prowl in Zanzibar. Many of the videos are goofy vacation snippets, but in the past few years, TikTokers have matured a bit. Now some are eager to show off their hometowns, which lets armchair travelers dig deeper into destinations and get a personal perspective on a place. While some of these TikTok travel guides simply serve as inspiration for trip-planning, others offer real-life tours, too. Here, we highlight five of the most entertaining.
Deep Dish on Chicago  In Chicago, Sherman “Dilla” Thomas, 40, centers his TikTok videos on the city’s African-American history, exploring topics like redlining, segregation and gang culture. Calling himself Chicago’s favorite neighborhood historian, Mr. Thomas also delves into street names, local architecture, notable figures and the history of deep-dish pizza. A ComEd area operator and voracious reader, Mr. Thomas joined TikTok in November 2020, hoping to find an outlet for his local-history obsession. “I just have to get the stories out of me I guess,” he said. Last year, Mr. Thomas began offering occasional in-person tours, guiding visitors around historic neighborhoods such as Pullman and Bronzeville. His two-hour bus tours stop at places like the Pilgrim Baptist Church, which some consider the birthplace of gospel music, and the Eighth Regiment Armory, where Black soldiers were based during World War I.

Michael Bowling, a computer scientist at the University of Alberta, keeps a tidy office, unlike many of his colleagues, whose spaces overflow with technological detritus. Prof. Bowling’s only clutter is the dense, inscrutable formulas and graphs scrawled with technicolor markers on a wall-size whiteboard. He needs the elaborate mathematics because he is trying to make sense of a very complex world: the game of poker. “Even the smallest variant of poker has a billion billion decision points,” he told me.
The Computer Poker Research Group at the university was formed in 1996, following Garry Kasparov’s chess matches with  IBM ’s  Deep Blue that year. Poker’s mathematical complexity rivals that of chess—or exceeds it, depending on the variant—and poker adds randomness and hidden information, bringing it closer to the “real world” that AI researchers so badly want to influence.

It’s virtually impossible at the moment to hire anyone to do any repair, maintenance or construction work on your home, no matter how badly you need it. Right now, repair people are like the hottest kids in high school. Remember them? They were attractive. They had godlike skills at pretty much everything. The whole school envied them. They were utterly unattainable. And you, the pimply-faced freshman, stood by and looked on with a heart full of yearning as they strutted confidently past you toward their lockers.
Back then, you knew better than to just call up one of these high school hotties and say “I need you now.” And you shouldn’t do it with your repair or maintenance person either because you’ll get the same result. The good news is that the techniques that actually worked to attract the attention of the Prom King or Queen also work when attempting to secure the services of your local professional repair person. Let’s break it down:

The actor and director Fred Savage is a lifelong watch collector, the sort of enthusiast who frequents watch auctions in his spare time. So when he was working as an executive producer and director on “The Wonder Years,” the recent ABC reboot of the classic coming-of-age show in which he starred in the 1980s, he wanted the characters to wear watches authentic to the series’s 1960s setting. For that he turned to his friend Eric Wind, a former senior watch specialist at Christie’s and now an independent watch dealer in Palm Beach, Fla.
Mr. Wind primarily peddles rare Rolex and Patek Philippe watches to private collectors, but in recent years, he’s carved out a niche facilitating watch loans for movies and TV shows including “Crazy Rich Asians” and FX’s “The Premise”—a key player in a subculture that fixates on the intersection between horology and pop-culture and has ripple effects for watch marketing, watch blogs and watch collectors.

A bit of distressing news: Americans are reading fewer books. At least that’s the report from the gang at Gallup, who surveyed U.S. adults in December 2021 and learned that we’re all individually reading “roughly two or three fewer books per year” than we did in 2001-16.
I admit I was surprised, because I’d been under the impression that we’d all rediscovered the pleasures of the printed word during the pandemic—that, in addition to painting self-portraits, baking succulent sourdoughs, mastering archery and rewatching every season of “Barney Miller,” we were finding time to curl up on the couch by the fire and dig into “Ulysses.”

Last April, virologist Jesse Bloom wanted to examine sequences of the genetic code of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The sequences, which contain instructions that the virus uses to make copies of itself, can change as the virus spreads from person to person. Dr. Bloom, who runs a lab focused on the evolution of viruses at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, thought that the mutations might allow him to track the pandemic back to its beginnings, a bit like the way detectives use DNA evidence to solve crimes.
But when he went to the public database maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health to find data about Covid-19 patients in early 2020 in Wuhan, China, the files weren’t there. He later learned that the sequences had been removed from public access in June 2020 at the request of the Wuhan University researcher who deposited them. NIH rules say that the data belong to the individual who submits them.

The Omicron variant is spreading across the globe, but so far the strain appears to be less deadly than its predecessors. That’s good news, but here’s a risk that policy makers in every country should appreciate: Policies designed to slow the spread of Omicron may end up creating a supervariant that is more infectious, more virulent and more resistant to vaccines. That would be a man-made disaster.
To minimize that risk, policy makers must tolerate the rapid spread of milder variants. This will require difficult trade-offs, but it will save lives in the long run. We should end mask mandates and social distancing in most settings not because they don’t slow the spread—the usual argument against such measures—but because they probably do.

Kansas family doctor Jennifer McKenney has tried three times in recent months to persuade her longtime patient, McCager Thompson, to get a Covid-19 vaccine.
First he said no, then maybe, then this past week he was back to no.
“As far as proof, I’m just not sold on it yet,” Mr. Thompson said. But the 73-year-old retiree also hasn’t ruled out the shots, and his physician doesn’t plan to stop nudging.

“I’m not giving up,” said Dr. McKenney, who runs a clinic in rural Fredonia. “I rarely give up on these guys.”

Mr. Thompson is one of roughly 64 million eligible Americans who, a little more than a year after the Covid-19 vaccine rollout began, have yet to roll up their sleeves for a single shot despite campaigns attesting to their safety and efficacy and recent public-health pleas as the highly transmissible Omicron variant overwhelms hospitals.
According to officials, some common reasons people say they are declining vaccines include fears of side effects or longer-term health implications and mistrust of government and the health industry. Beliefs stemming from antivaccine rhetoric on social media and elsewhere are another impediment, officials say.
To reach the holdouts, physicians, public leaders and community groups are taking more narrowly targeted, sometimes personal approaches in what they say could be a yearslong ground game.






Dr. Jennifer McKenney says she doesn’t plan to stop nudging patients who remain unvaccinated against Covid-19.

New tactics range from microtargeting Haitian Creole speakers outside Atlanta, reaching out to attendees at Alabama funerals, training hundreds of small-clinic doctors to combat misinformation, and talking to vaccine doubters on call-in radio shows.
“Gone are the days where we could hang a shingle outside and everyone would line up to get vaccines,” said Dr. Dean Sidelinger, the state health officer and epidemiologist in Oregon, which is running videos on sites such as Reddit and Pinterest featuring residents who overcame doubts and got vaccinated.
All Americans ages 5 and up—roughly 312 million people—are now eligible for vaccinations. By Saturday, federal data show nearly 248.7 million people had received at least one shot, and that number over the last seven days has grown by about 323,000 each day. That leaves about one-fifth of the population that could get a shot but hasn’t.
In West Virginia, about 56% of the population is fully vaccinated, 7 percentage points below the national average. James Hoyer, who leads West Virginia’s Joint Interagency Task Force for Covid-19, said that while the pace is slow, new people are getting their first shots every day.
“We still believe, based on focus groups and data, that we still only have about 17% that are what I call ‘the absolute hell nos,’” Mr. Hoyer said.

It is important, this far into the vaccine campaign, to connect through trusted community sources, Mr. Hoyer and other officials said. West Virginia’s playbook includes recently asking physicians with state roots to field vaccine questions on a well-known radio show.
Similarly, this month Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the first time devoted one of his regular morning radio show visits entirely to taking questions from unvaccinated listeners.
One caller, identified as Sean from Berwick, expressed concern about long-term side effects, saying, “I’m just an average ordinary guy, and I’m afraid.”
Over several minutes, Dr. Shah walked Sean through how vaccines work and what is in them. He said he’d recommend them to his own buddies and cousins and praised the caller “for thinking about this carefully and thoughtfully.”
“Maybe I will get the vaccine,” Sean said before going off the air.
In a federally supported effort in December, the National Association of Community Health Centers hosted a webinar that taught some 200 doctors to counter online misinformation.
Joe Smyser, chief executive of The Public Goods Projects, a nonprofit tracking vaccine chatter online, advised doctors to respond with links not only from the usual state and federal public-health agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but from local groups, like a Chamber of Commerce.






Polling data show that vaccine resistance is heavier in rural areas and that Republicans are more resistant than Democrats.

“What we have been advising people to do is to ‘stop linking just to the CDC’s website,’” Dr. Smyser said. “Public health has really, really low trust at the moment.”
Nearly a year of polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation, most recently in November, consistently shows between 12% and 16% of adults say they definitely won’t get a shot.

One new idea: A federally supported University of Alabama-led program is approaching funeral homes, hoping to offer education, testing and vaccines to attendees at family members’ request, said Hee Yun Lee, professor at the university’s School of Social Work.
Elsewhere, a new task force in Atlanta’s suburbs plans to tout vaccine benefits to those waiting in long testing lines. In the same area, organizers of a big vaccine clinic at a former Sears store avoid using the word “mass” when describing their mass vaccination site because “that sounds terrifying to some people,” said Chad Wasdin, a spokesman for the local health agency.
Missouri commissioned consulting firm Deloitte to closely study its population, using at least 20 variables in nearly 1,400 census tracts, to better understand who might still get shots and how to tailor pro-vaccine efforts. Consultants aim to soon start taking these plans to counties and local health departments.
The aim is enough vaccination so “we don’t have people dying left and right,” and life can return to normal, said George Turabelidze, Missouri’s state epidemiologist. “When that is accomplished, that is good enough for me,” he said.

Most of us in our 20s and 30s are familiar with the rhythms of friend-group life changes. First, people find their long-term relationships, and in each case you hear all the dish about who this new person is, and you vet them to make sure they’re a fit match for your beloved friend. Then, the couple moves in together, so you help assemble new furniture and attend the housewarming party. After that, maybe there’s a wedding—or, in the past couple of years, a Zoom ceremony—and you clink Champagne and make teary-eyed toasts. 
Everyone knows what comes next: Wait a couple of years, and your calendar will start filling up with invitations to baby showers and sip and sees, and you find yourself shopping for teensy shoes and picture books and other gifts appropriate for new parents.

WASHINGTON—Hotels, fitness clubs, tour bus companies and minor league ball clubs are part of a long line of businesses seeking billions of dollars in new Covid-19 relief aid—if they can overcome opposition from many Republicans who say Congress has already given enough.
Lobbyists for the businesses say their campaign has taken on new urgency as the Omicron variant sweeps across the country, forcing many companies to scale back or shut down operations as employees call in sick and customers cancel orders and reservations.
 A few Republican lawmakers support more relief funding for targeted industries, but most are generally opposed to spending more funds to help struggling businesses. These opponents say that the government has already provided sufficient relief, including more than $900 billion through the Paycheck Protection Program, and that more government spending will fuel inflation and budget deficits.






The restaurant industry is pressing for $40 billion from Congress to help struggling businesses.

“The U.S. government has no money to give anyone,“ said









      
      Sen. Rand Paul



      (R., Ky.). ”In the past two years, Congress piled on several trillion dollars to our already substantial deficit. This unprecedented accumulation of debt is causing today’s inflation and will continue to wreak havoc in the future.”

Lobbyists for those seeking aid, which also includes restaurants and Broadway stage productions, contend that their clients were left out of previous relief efforts or didn’t get nearly enough to cover losses.
Industry lobbyists are targeting legislation being crafted by Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.), the chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, who had found an ally in Sen. Roger Wicker (R., Miss.) for a bill that would deliver roughly $60 billion in grants from the Small Business Administration.
Efforts to provide Covid-19 relief assistance appear to have support in the House. Nearly 100 Democratic and Republican lawmakers signed a letter in December calling for help for businesses.

Prospects are sketchier in the Senate. Under modern Senate procedures, most legislation needs 60 votes for approval. Democrats and their allies control 50 votes, so Mr. Cardin is seeking to sweeten the stimulus bill with provisions that can draw the support of 10 Republicans. He has the support of roughly a half-dozen Republicans so far.
Lobbyists for various industries are angling to add their Covid-19 relief proposals to a large appropriations bill that Congress must approve by mid-February to fund the government for the current fiscal year. But that too could prove tricky.
Most Republican lawmakers say they aren’t eager for more government spending, though that could change if the Omicron surge further disrupts the economy and forces business closures and layoffs.

Some industries seeking aid say they weren’t able to qualify for previous relief plans, such as the Paycheck Protection Program. That was geared mainly to help small businesses keep employees on staff and didn’t help those that were forced to shut down or had the bulk of their expenses in overhead, such as rent.
Other industries, such as professional sports, were excluded altogether. But while the big pro teams played partial seasons and continued to earn money from broadcast rights, that wasn’t the case for many minor league clubs.
Jason Freier, the owner of the Chattanooga Lookouts Double-A baseball team in Tennessee, said the cancellation of the 2020 season forced him to bench roughly 300 seasonal and part-time employees who worked as ticket takers, groundskeepers and usher. The players are paid by Major League Baseball.
The team also furloughed all front-office employees except its president. The Lookouts returned to the diamond last year, but with a shortened schedule and attendance restrictions. Revenue was down nearly 20% in 2021, compared with 2019, Mr. Freier said. Revenue dropped more than 90% from 2019 to 2020.
“We are in a position where it is pretty urgent,” said Mr. Freier.
Grants from the Small Business Administration could be used by the businesses to pay employees and cover other expenses related to Covid-19.
Two years ago Mr. Freier failed to persuade lawmakers to include sports teams in legislation that allocated $16 billion to live-performance theaters and concert halls from the Small Business Administration.






Gym owners’ lobbyists are seeking $30 billion, which is what they say gyms lost from the start of the pandemic through last June.

“We are not asking for anything different than the relief provided to other shuttered venues,” he said.
Mr. Freier took his case to









      
      Sen. Marsha Blackburn



      (R., Tenn.), who co-sponsored a bill with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) to allocate $550 million in aid to minor league baseball clubs that aren’t owned by Major League Baseball teams.
Advocates for other minor league sports, including soccer, basketball and hockey, persuaded other senators to include them in the sports fund and expand it to $750 million.
Gym owners say the PPP wasn’t much help to them because they have few employees and a greater share of expenses from facility leases and insurance. Their lobbyists are now pressing Congress for a $30 billion aid package, which is roughly what they say gym owners have lost from the start of the pandemic through June 2021. Roughly one in five health clubs permanently shut down.
“We are making sure that Republicans understand that within reason, there is a need for targeted relief” for some industries, said









      
      Matt Haller,



      the president of the International Franchise Association, which represents franchise operations including gyms, restaurants, hotels and hair salons.
The American Bus Association is seeking $6 billion for its members, including companies that provide airport shuttle services, tours, charters and school bus transportation.



“‘We started to see a bit of a recovery and then everything shut down and started going the other way.’”


— Peter Pantuso, American Bus Association president 



The industry received $2 billion in federal relief funds from Congress under a Covid-19 relief package in late 2020, but









      
      Peter Pantuso,



      the trade group’s president, said it covered just a fraction of the industry’s losses.
Bus industry revenue fell to $2.6 billion in 2020, he said, from $15.3 billion the year before. Last year revenue began to recover until the Delta and Omicron variants prompted new rounds of cancellations of reservations for tour buses.
“We started to see a bit of a recovery and then everything shut down and started going the other way,” Mr. Pantuso said.
Convenience stores and other retailers along the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico are also seeking relief help, saying their businesses suffered at times when the borders were shut down to nonessential travel during the pandemic. Several senators have introduced legislation that would provide $500 million in government loans to businesses within 25 miles of the border.
The hotel industry is pushing legislation in the House and Senate that calls for the Treasury Department to cover roughly $20 billion in salary and benefit payments to employees of hotels that have seen revenue losses of 40% or more. The legislation has the backing of Unite Here, the labor union that represents about 300,000 hotel, laundry and food service employees.
The restaurant industry is pressing for $40 billion in funds from Congress to help struggling businesses. Last year a special $28.6 billion federal fund for restaurants quickly ran out of money. The National Restaurant Association launched a lobbying campaign for another $40 billion to refill the program for the nearly 200,000 restaurants that applied but didn’t get funding.
“Restaurants are facing a perfect storm of labor problems, consumer confidence from Covid and rising food prices,” said Sean Kennedy, who helps run the campaign for the restaurant industry.

SYDNEY—Novak Djokovic was deported from Australia after a court upheld a decision to cancel his visa, ending the tennis star’s bid to defend his Australian Open title as an unvaccinated player despite the country’s tough Covid-19 vaccine requirements.
The Federal Court of Australia on Sunday ruled Immigration Minister Alex Hawke acted lawfully when he canceled Djokovic’s visa two days earlier, citing public interest. 
 The men’s world No.1 had arrived in Melbourne as the heavy favorite for a record 10th win at the Australian Open, which starts on Monday and included Djokovic as its top men’s seed. Djokovic, who spoke against vaccine mandates as recently as November, said he believed he had an exemption from rules requiring travelers to the country to have received two shots of a Covid-19 vaccine.
Djokovic had been scheduled to face fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanović on Monday in the opening round of the tournament. He instead left Sunday night on an Emirates flight to Dubai and might be blocked from returning for three years, by which time he would be 37 and likely past his prime as a player. 

Djokovic said he was extremely disappointed. “I will now be taking some time to rest and to recuperate, before making any further comments beyond this,” he said.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he welcomed the decision to keep the country’s borders strong and keep Australians safe.
“Irrespective of how this point has been reached, Novak is one of our sport’s greatest champions and his absence from the Australian Open is a loss for the game,” said the Association of Tennis Professionals, which organizes the men’s tennis tour.
Djokovic arrived in Australia as the country faced a surge in cases of Covid-19, which authorities had successfully contained until recently, largely by closing the border. Mr. Hawke said that letting the tennis star stay could stoke antivaccine sentiment.

Authorities have been encouraging as many of the country’s 26 million people as possible to get vaccinated as Australia shifts from suppressing the virus to living with it. Djokovic’s 11 days in the country made him a lightning rod in the debate over Covid-19 vaccine mandates.
“His presence in Australia, given his well-known stance on vaccination, creates a risk of strengthening the anti-vaccination sentiment of a minority of the Australian community,” Mr. Hawke said in a notice to cancel Djokovic’s visa a second time. 
The country has one of the highest Covid-19 vaccination rates in the world. Australia, where children between 5 and 11 years old began to receive their first shots only last week, has vaccinated roughly 79% of its total population, according to Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. has, by comparison, vaccinated 64%.
The number of people hesitant about taking Covid-19 vaccines has fallen sharply over the past year, according to the Melbourne Institute, an economic and social-policy research center at the University of Melbourne, but those still resistant might be entrenched in their view. The center, which tracks community hesitancy over Covid-19 vaccines, says Australia might struggle to convince 10% of its population to receive shots for the coronavirus and that one in four might be hesitant to receive boosters.
Antivaccine protests have occurred in major cities in recent months, sometimes attracting thousands of people to protest mandatory vaccination in certain industries or for children. On Saturday, protesters again marched through Melbourne and Sydney—Australia’s two largest cities—some of them waving Serbian flags and others clutching messages of support for Djokovic. 
Djokovic’s attorney Nick Wood had argued that Mr. Hawke’s reasoning for wanting to deport the tennis star was flawed because his deportation could also inflame antivaccine sentiment. Mr. Hawke’s attorney, Stephen Lloyd, told the court that the minister had noted the protests.

Conflict over vaccine mandates has reverberated through Canberra, the country’s capital. Five coalition senators in November crossed the floor to back a minor party’s bill against vaccine mandates, which was unsuccessful. 
Australian lawmaker Craig Kelly last year quit the center-right Liberal Party that governs as part of a coalition after being criticized by Mr. Morrison, the prime minister, for social-media posts undermining the government’s vaccination strategy. After the court ruled against Djokovic on Sunday, Mr. Kelly, who now leads the minor, right-wing United Australia Party, tweeted: “Human rights advocates & believers in Australia as a ‘free country’ should be horrified.”
Djokovic was initially detained after he arrived at a Melbourne airport on Jan. 5 and immigration authorities decided his vaccine exemption wasn’t valid. On Monday, a court overturned the cancellation of his visa on technical grounds, freeing him to practice on the blue courts of Melbourne’s Rod Laver Arena, before Mr. Hawke exercised his discretionary power as immigration minister to cancel the visa again. 
Many Australians were incensed by Djokovic’s attempt to gain an exemption from vaccination rules. Australia’s total confirmed Covid-19 cases have climbed above 1.7 million, four times higher than the start of 2022, according to the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data project.
Footage showing two television news anchors criticizing Djokovic, including one labeling him as lying and sneaky, was leaked online last week by a subtitling company employee. Seven West Media Ltd., one of Australia’s largest media companies, said it would investigate the leak but didn’t apologize for the remarks.
Australians have been living under extreme travel restrictions for most of the past two years. Tens of thousands of Australians were stranded abroad when officials shut the country’s international border, severely restricting arrivals and barring locals from leaving until only recently. 
Even within Australia travel was heavily curtailed, with lengthy restrictions on state borders that kept people from seeing family and friends for important events such as births and weddings. Sometimes new or tightened restrictions trapped people on the wrong side of state lines from their homes for weeks or months at a time.






Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison welcomed the ruling that cleared the way for Novak Djokovic’s deportation.

Highlighting the sacrifices Australians have made during the pandemic, Mr. Morrison said on Sunday that authorities were committed to Australia’s tough border laws. “Our government has always understood this and has been prepared to take the decisions and actions necessary to protect the integrity of our borders,” he said.
Serbian President Alexander Vucic questioned why Australia didn’t refuse Djokovic’s visa or deport him immediately. “Why do you harass him, why do you mistreat him, as well as his family and a nation that is free and proud?” he said in a four-minute video posted on social media before the court’s decision.
The saga has attracted world-wide attention. At times, more than 80,000 viewers were streaming Sunday’s court proceedings on YouTube.
Djokovic was one of 26 players or coaches to apply for medical exemptions to the vaccination rules, Tennis Australia said, and one of a handful to receive one initially. However, since his case garnered widespread public attention, one women’s player and one coach, both unvaccinated, have been deported.
Djokovic’s application for a medical exemption from Australia’s vaccination rules hinged on his infection with, and recovery from, Covid-19 in December. Immigration officials didn’t accept his exemption, which was provided by Tennis Australia.
Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Hawke’s attorney, said Djokovic could easily have agreed to receive a vaccine before that infection. 
“You should have the freedom to choose, to decide what you want to do. In this particular case, what you want to put in your body,” Djokovic said in November at a tournament in Turin, Italy. 
Djokovic could be almost 38 when he is next eligible to apply for an Australian visa. Australia’s Ken Rosewall is the oldest man to win a grand slam tennis tournament, taking the 1972 Australian Open title at 37 years, 1 month and 24 days.
With Djokovic’s rival Roger Federer currently recovering from knee surgery, this will be the first Australian Open held without either man since 1999. Djokovic was replaced in the first round by Italy’s Salvatore Caruso, a so-called lucky loser from the qualifying tournament.

It is startling when two speeches within 24 hours, neither much heralded in advance—the second wouldn’t even have been given without the first—leave you knowing you have witnessed a seminal moment in the history of an administration, but it happened this week. The president’s Tuesday speech in Atlanta, on voting rights, was a disaster for him. By the end of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s answering speech on Wednesday you knew some new break point had occurred, that President Biden might have thought he was just crooning to part of his base but the repercussions were greater than that; he was breaking in some new way with others—and didn’t know it. It is poor political practice when you fail to guess the effects of your actions. He meant to mollify an important constituency but instead he filled his opponents with honest indignation and, I suspect, encouraged in that fractured group some new unity. 
The speech itself was aggressive, intemperate, not only offensive but meant to offend. It seemed prepared by people who think there is only the Democratic Party in America, that’s it, everyone else is an outsider who can be disparaged. It was a mistake on so many levels. Presidents more than others in politics have to maintain an even strain, as astronauts used to say. If a president is rhetorically manipulative and divisive on a voting-rights bill it undercuts what he’s trying to establish the next day on Covid and the economy. The over-the-top language of the speech made him seem more emotional, less competent. The portentousness—“In our lives and . . . the life of our nation, there are moments so stark that they divide all that came before them from everything that followed. They stop time”—made him appear incapable of understanding how the majority of Americans understand our own nation’s history and the vast array of its challenges.

A bobsled can whip around hairpin turns at over 90 miles an hour, but for Elana Meyers Taylor, a triple Olympic medalist, the most invigorating moment of a race is just before it begins. “I love the feeling that anything can happen,” she explains over the phone from Winterberg, Germany, fresh off winning a couple of gold medals in the sport’s World Cup. She adds that this electric sense of potential is especially powerful in the Olympics: “At that point you know you made it to the games and there’s no champion yet,” she says. “Just taking a breath, taking it all in, that’s the moment I live for.”
This year’s Winter Olympics, opening Feb. 4 in Beijing, will mark the fourth time Ms. Meyers Taylor, 37, has represented the U.S. at the games. Having already won a bronze and two silver medals, she is vying for the elusive gold.

The mistrust of political leaders that has been eroding American national cohesion for years is matched only by their apparent willingness to say and do things that justify it. 
So when Vice President Kamala Harris suggests, as she did last week, a sort of equivalence between last year’s Capitol riot on the one hand and Pearl Harbor and 9/11 on the other, we might give her the benefit of the doubt and put it down to a characteristic combination of historical ignorance, cheap rhetorical excess and hyperpartisan overreach. With the Biden administration’s political woes intensifying in an election year, the identification of the domestic opposition as a seditious enemy may be their last, best hope of salvaging something.

ONE MORNING last October, Maynard Villaflores, 24, set his alarm for 5:55 a.m. Snoozing was not an option: At 6 a.m., New York brand Telfar was dropping a limited number of its coveted unisex handbags online. “Within two minutes the bags [would] be sold out,” said Mr. Villaflores, a social-media manager in Portland, Ore. He snapped up a mini olive number that he now wears across his chest. “The rush and [hype around the drop] reminds me of buying Jordans,” he said.
Mr. Villaflores is not the only man to liken bags to kicks. For the past decade, men have feverishly collected sneakers, nerding out over exclusive styles. Some brandish them on sidewalks while others see them as investments, keeping them box-fresh until resale. Rare models fetch dizzying sums on online marketplaces like StockX and at auction. (Just last year, Sotheby’s sold Kanye West’s Nike Air Yeezy 1 Prototype for $1.8 million.) Because of their sport and streetwear connotations, “sneakers helped break the stigma” that an interest in fashion was inherently feminine, said Jian DeLeon, Nordstrom’s men’s fashion director. “[Now], it’s OK for guys to obsess over accessories.” Recently, another men’s accessory has begun inspiring sneaker-level fervor: cross-body bags that cling to the torso like a baby monkey. Sold by brands like Fendi, Prada and Stüssy, such bags convey as much savvy and élan as a new pair of Salomons.

Both say they have the best claim to the new district, after the state’s map was redrawn during a once-in-a-decade redistricting process. The district lost some of Ms. Stevens’s more-conservative constituents and picked up some more-liberal voters from the old districts of Mr. Levin and another adjacent lawmaker.

RIO DE JANEIRO—Tatiana Aparecida de Jesus used to walk the city’s streets as a sex worker, high on crack cocaine. Last year, the mother of five joined a small Pentecostal congregation in downtown Rio called Sanctification in the Lord and left her old life behind. “The pastor hugged me without asking anything,” said Ms. de Jesus, 41, who was raised a Catholic and is one of more than a million Brazilians who have joined an evangelical or Pentecostal church since the beginning of the pandemic, according to researchers. “When you are poor, it makes so much of a difference when someone just says ‘good morning’ to you, ‘good afternoon,’ or shakes your hand,” she said.

For centuries, to be Latin American was to be Catholic; the religion faced virtually no competition. Today, Catholicism has lost adherents to other faiths in the region, especially Pentecostalism, and more recently to the ranks of the unchurched. The shift has continued under the first Latin American pope.






Seven countries in the region—Uruguay, the Dominican Republic and five in Central America—had a majority of non-Catholics in 2018, according to a survey by Latinobarómetro, a Chilean-based pollster. In a symbolic milestone, Brazil, which has the most Catholics of any country in the world, is expected to become minority-Catholic as soon as this year, according to estimates by academics that track religious affiliation. In Rio state, it has already happened. Catholics make up 46% of the population, according to the latest national census in 2010, and a little more than a third of some poverty-stricken favelas, or slums. “The Vatican is losing the biggest Catholic country in the world—that’s a huge loss, an irreversible one,” said José Eustáquio Diniz Alves, a leading Brazilian demographer and former professor at the national statistics agency. At the current rate, he estimates Catholics will account for fewer than 50% of all Brazilians by early July.






Felipe Estevão and Tatiana Aparecida de Jesus attend an evangelical worship service with their children in Rio de Janeiro.



The reasons for this shift are complex, including political changes that reduced the Catholic Church’s advantages over other religions, as well as growing secularization in much of the world. During the pandemic, evangelical churches have been especially effective at using social media to keep people engaged, said Mr. Diniz Alves. Critics inside and outside the Catholic Church also point to its failures to satisfy the religious and social demands of many people, especially among the poor. Latin Americans often describe the Catholic Church as out of touch with the everyday struggles of its congregation. The rise of liberation theology in the 1960s and ’70s, a time when the Catholic Church in Latin America increasingly stressed its mission as one of social justice, in some cases drawing on Marxist ideas, failed to counter the appeal of Protestant faiths. Or, in the words of a now-legendary quip, variously attributed to Catholic and Protestant sources: “The Catholic Church opted for the poor and the poor opted for the Pentecostals.” The declining influence of Catholicism in Latin America has far-reaching social and political consequences. In countries such as Brazil, conversions to Pentecostal Christianity have boosted socially conservative views from the favelas to the halls of Congress, helping to propel right-wing President 









      
      Jair Bolsonaro



       to power in 2018. While President Bolsonaro still identifies as Catholic, he got himself baptized by a Pentecostal pastor in the River Jordan in 2016 in the lead-up to his presidential campaign. Pentecostals and evangelicals are prominently represented in his cabinet and make up a third of Brazil’s congress. His wife attends an evangelical church.

Pentecostalism is a tradition originating in the U.S. which emphasizes direct contact with the Holy Spirit through highly physical forms of worship such as speaking in tongues and faith healing. It is part of the larger evangelical Protestant movement, which stresses biblical authority, the experience of being “born again” and the mission to win converts. Mainline Protestant churches such as Anglicans and Lutherans have made relatively few inroads in Latin America. In nations with growing numbers of people with no religious affiliation, more-liberal social practices are growing. Argentina, the pope’s native country, legalized abortion last year and Chile’s congress is taking the first steps on a bill to decriminalize the procedure. Even in Mexico, which still has a large Catholic majority, the church’s hold on society is weakening, as seen in the Supreme Court’s September vote to decriminalize abortion.

Latin America and the Caribbean is home to 41% of the world’s Catholics, according to the Vatican. Estimates of how many Latin Americans remain Catholic vary, but all sides agree the percentages are falling. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, 69% of Latin Americans were Catholic in 2014, though 84% had been raised in the church. Nineteen percent of Latin Americans identified themselves as Protestants. Of those, 65% identified with Pentecostalism. Under 









      
      Pope Francis,



       who met with Pentecostal and evangelical leaders when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires, the Vatican has sought to coexist peacefully with those of other beliefs rather than fight the rising tide of rival faiths. Pope Francis has often inveighed against missionary efforts aimed at winning converts. At a 2019 Vatican synod on Latin America’s Amazon region, there was scarcely any discussion of the church’s losses of adherents, even though a recent report by a church agency showed that 46% of the Amazon region’s 34 million inhabitants weren’t Catholics. The gathering devoted more attention to the region’s environmental challenges, a signature cause of the current pontificate.

Latin America’s religious transformation began with independence from Spain and Portugal in the 19th century, after which Catholicism, which had come with colonization starting in the 16th century, ceased to be the state religion. The church retained a privileged legal position in many countries and it wasn’t until the mid-20th century that competing faiths began to grow. The most successful by far of these new faiths was Pentecostalism. Between 1970 and 2020, the number of Pentecostals in Brazil grew to 46.7 million from 6.8 million, according to the World Christian Database. In Guatemala, they grew more than 10-fold, to 2.9 million from fewer than 196,000.

Pentecostalism’s loose organizational structure has helped it make inroads into Latin America’s poorest neighborhoods, where churches offer material as well as spiritual help. Lay-led churches with flocks as small as a few dozen families organize donations of rice and beans for hungry families, fund soccer clubs for young boys to lure them away from drug gangs and organize private healthcare as an alternative to Brazil’s failing public hospitals. According to the 2014 Pew survey, the most popular reason given by former Catholics in Latin America for embracing some form of Protestantism was to have a more personal connection with God, cited by 81% of respondents. Nearly six in 10 said they left Catholicism because they found “a church that helps members more.” For Jaime Martins, a 45-year-old lawyer from Rio de Janeiro, the turning point came in 2016, when Brazil’s economic crash left him penniless, sending him into a downward spiral of depression and addiction. His wife left him, he got into trouble with the police, and he took to wandering across the city’s highways at night. “I wanted to get run over.”






Jaime Martins, shown with his son Thiago, converted after drug addiction that took him close to death.



A Pentecostal church in Rio funded his drug rehabilitation program, and another gave him accommodation and a job as an assistant in the church, said Mr. Martins. Unlike larger Catholic churches in the area, the informal structure of the Pentecostal and evangelical churches allows for greater contact between church leaders and worshipers like Mr. Martins. “The Catholic priests wouldn’t even have coffee with us,” he recalled. Members of the clergy say they need to be more accessible to ordinary worshipers, much like Pope Francis, who focused on down-and-out neighborhoods when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires,. Today, priests and nuns can be found working in barrios and rural areas across the region.  “We should be much more approachable, we should be much more with the people,” said the Rev. Gustavo Morello, a member of the pope’s Jesuit order from Argentina and a professor of sociology at Boston College who has studied religious pluralism across Latin America.

Evangelicals tend to be more engaged—60% of those interviewed in a 2007 study in Brazil said they go to church more than once a week, compared with only 16% among Catholics. Tithes and the profits from a business empire run by Brazil’s evangelical churches, which includes television networks and cruise companies, have given the movement a financial firepower that enables it to expand into poverty-stricken suburbs and fund political campaigns. In downtown São Paulo, South America’s largest megalopolis, a $300 million replica of Solomon’s Temple stands as testimony to evangelism’s meteoric rise. Built in 2014 by one of Brazil’s biggest and wealthiest neo-Pentecostal churches, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, the temple can hold up to 10,000 worshipers. Amid the pomp—builders imported enough marble from Israel to cover 10 soccer fields for its walls and floors—its pastors offer down-to-earth advice from a gold-plated altar. In group sessions of couples therapy every Thursday, pastors impart tips on issues such as how to encourage a husband to do the washing and forgiving a wife after an affair. Pentecostal pastors are typically married, which they say gives them an advantage on such topics over celibate Catholic priests. Many Pentecostals preach the “theology of prosperity”—more commonly known in the U.S. as the Prosperity Gospel—which holds that God’s grace is reflected in material wealth. At Solomon’s Temple in São Paulo, suited men regularly line up at the altar with velvet red sacks and credit-card machines to receive offerings as the pastor promises his followers that they too will get rich if they donate generously.






Pastor Josué Valandro Jr, president of the Attitude Church.



“They’re places where you’re not a bad person for dreaming big, for wanting to earn more,” said Josué Valandro Jr., pastor of the Rio de Janeiro-based Attitude Church, an evangelical Baptist congregation whose members include Brazil’s first lady 









      
      Michelle Bolsonaro.



       Some social scientists believe that the growth of Pentecostalism in Latin America will reach a ceiling in the coming years, but there is a consensus that the religious market will remain a pluralistic and competitive one. Some Catholic movements in Latin America have sought to win back lost sheep, either by emulating important features of Pentecostalism, such as ecstatic worship, or by reviving a more traditional form of Catholicism, including the Latin Mass. The Rev. Martín Lasarte, a Uruguayan priest appointed by Pope Francis to the 2019 Vatican synod on Latin America’s Amazon region, believes the liberation theology movement has often placed political and social issues above the religious experience. In such cases, “it lacks the existential sense of the joy of living the Gospel, this personal encounter that so many Pentecostal churches give to the person,” he said. Since the 1970s, Charismatic Catholicism has been a way to keep many Catholics attracted to Pentecostalism inside the ranks, with faith healing and speaking in tongues, combined with distinctively Catholic features including devotion to the Virgin Mary. In 2020, 22.8% of Catholics in Latin America were charismatics, according to the World Christian Database, maintained by Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in Massachusetts.  A more recent movement is in militant conservative Catholicism which stresses apologetics, or the defense of Catholic doctrine. A major leader is the Brazilian Rev. Paulo Ricardo, a priest with 1.5 million followers on Facebook who has condemned liberation theology as heresy and enthusiastically supported elements of Mr. Bolsonaro’s agenda such as relaxed laws on gun ownership. Pope Francis, while embracing a different kind of politics, has hardly neglected Latin America in his ministry: He made the first international trip of his reign to Brazil, in July 2013, and has since traveled to nine other countries in the region. But he is clearly not leading a crusade to reclaim the region for Catholicism. “The church certainly can’t expect to turn back history, let alone impose some sort of centralized hegemony,” said Pedro Morandé Court, a Chilean sociologist who sits on the Vatican’s Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, an international body of scholars that advises the pope.

An unvaccinated father in the Canadian city of Montreal has temporarily lost visitation rights to his 12-year-old because he could expose his child to Covid-19, according to a recent court judgment.
The decision is the first in Quebec that deprives a parent of rights over a child because of vaccination status, said Sylvie Schirm, a lawyer specializing in family law who wasn’t involved in the case. It is unusual and possibly the first decision blocking parental rights due to vaccination status.
 It is also the latest example of Western countries tightening the screws on unvaccinated people as the Omicron variant infects millions and overwhelms heath systems.
The premier of Quebec,









      
      François Legault,



      recently floated the idea of asking unvaccinated Quebecers to pay a health tax.

France’s President









      
      Emmanuel Macron



      said he wanted to “piss off” the unvaccinated with policies that place tough restrictions on them.
According to the judgment, which was made public in recent days, the unnamed father of the child lost access because his unvaccinated status put the child and two stepsiblings at risk, said Judge J. Sébastien Vaillancourt.
The father had asked to spend extra time with the child, but the mother asked for his visitation rights to be cut off because she was worried about her child’s exposure to Covid-19.
The judge noted that the child, who has received two vaccine doses, isn’t fully protected against the Omicron variant.

The father had said he had reservations about the vaccine but he followed other safety protocols and rarely left his house. The father’s Facebook feed suggested he was stridently opposed to vaccines, however, which helped convince the judge to rule against the father.
“It would normally have been in the child’s best interest to have contact with their father, but it is not in their best interest to have contacts with him if he is not vaccinated and opposes safety protocols in the context of epidemiological evidence,” said the judge in his decision.

The restriction will stay in effect until February, and the court could re-evaluate the decision if the surge in cases caused by Omicron ebbs, or if the father gets vaccinated, said the judge.
Ms. Schirm said the ruling adds to a growing body of precedent in which courts are deferring to health experts on vaccination advice over the rights of parents. In several other cases where one parent opposes vaccines while the other is in favor, the courts have consistently voted in favor of vaccination, she said.
In the Western province of Alberta, a court in December let a divorced woman vaccinate her two children over the objections of their father, who was opposed.

Sixteen major U.S. universities, including Yale University, Georgetown University and Northwestern University, are being sued for alleged antitrust violations because of the way they work together to determine financial-aid awards for students.
According to a lawsuit filed in Illinois federal court late Sunday by law firms representing five former students who attended some of the schools, the universities engaged in price fixing and unfairly limited aid by using a shared methodology to calculate applicants’ financial need. Schools are allowed under federal law to collaborate on their formulas, but only if they don’t consider applicants’ financial need in admissions decisions. The suit alleges these schools do weigh candidates’ ability to pay in certain circumstances, and therefore shouldn’t be eligible for the antitrust exemption.

The Omicron variant accounted for 98% of Covid-19 cases in the U.S. last week, based on estimates released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tuesday. The variant has fueled a rapid rise in infections since reaching the U.S. late last year, surpassing surges associated with earlier versions of the virus and almost eliminating Delta.
So far, the rate of hospitalizations associated with Omicron doesn’t appear as high as with prior variants, lending support to early studies indicating Omicron might be less severe than other variants. However, the sheer number of Omicron cases has led to the seven-day average of new hospital patients with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 cases running above last January’s record highs.

Omicron is pushing Covid-19 hospital admissions among children to record levels in the U.S. and the U.K. Doctors say the variant’s infectiousness—and not any increased severity—is probably mostly responsible.
Throughout the pandemic, children have been much less likely than adults to suffer severe illness from Covid-19, and doctors say that this appears to be true for Omicron, too. But sky-high case numbers mean that more children are ending up in the hospital both with Covid-19 and because of the disease, underscoring how a likely milder variant can still do more damage, simply by infecting more people.

To say that Big Tech controls the internet might seem like an exaggeration. Increasingly, in at least one sense, it’s literally true.
The internet can seem intangible, a post-physical environment where things like viral posts, virtual goods and metaverse concerts just sort of happen. But creating that illusion requires a truly gargantuan—and quickly-growing—web of physical connections.

Several circumstances—President Biden’s low approval rating, doubts over his capacity to run for re-election at 82, Vice President Kamala Harris’s unpopularity, and the absence of another strong Democrat to lead the ticket in 2024—have created a leadership vacuum in the party, which Mrs. Clinton viably could fill.

LONDON—The U.K. appears to have passed the peak of the latest wave of Covid-19 caused by Omicron, a promising sign that the highly transmissible variant’s impact may be brief, if intense, and fueling optimism that the pandemic may be waning.
Scientists say British data offer encouraging signs for countries behind the U.K. in the Omicron wave—such as the U.S.—that the variant is echoing the pattern it followed in South Africa, where cases rose rapidly over the course of just over a month, before falling back. The wave of Omicron infections in the U.S. is expected to peak over the weeks ahead, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said.

Rarely has a European leader spelled out the continent’s Covid-19 strategy as bluntly as French President Emmanuel Macron, who said last week: “The unvaccinated, I really want to piss them off.” 
The question facing the European Union is whether progressively excluding vaccine holdouts from work places and leisure spaces will be enough in the face of the Omicron variant to prevent a crisis in hospitals and avoid further lockdowns. France, Germany, Italy and many other EU countries are pressuring unvaccinated adults to get inoculated by excluding them from more everyday activities, while stopping short of a universal vaccine mandate. European arm-twisting contrasts with more laissez-faire approaches in the U.K. and U.S., but doesn’t satisfy public-health experts who say it would be more effective to make vaccination mandatory.

THE RISE OF streaming has ushered in an era of overlong films and series that should have been movies. But M. Night Shyamalan—who gained notoriety for blockbusters like 1999’s “The Sixth Sense” and 2002’s “Signs”—is currently writing the shortest film script of his career. He’s also producing something of a modern-day unicorn: a half-hour TV drama. “At my core, I am a minimalist,” said the filmmaker. “When you put limitations on what you’re working on, that’s when you find your voice and your beauty.”
The third season of that unicorn, the  Apple  TV+ thriller “Servant,” for which Mr. Shyamalan serves as showrunner, executive producer and sometimes director, drops January 21. Its premise—a grieving couple hires a nanny to help care for the doll that has replaced their dead child—could easily sustain one-hour episodes. But delivering the story in 30-minute bites, Mr. Shyamalan said, allows him to focus on the few themes that ground each episode. Similarly, in writing a tight script for his next feature, “Knock at the Cabin,” he’s learned that every line and every moment has to earn its place in the film.

Omicron has stricken millions and left businesses unable to operate fully as sickened or exposed workers isolate at home. For those already working from home, though, the variant’s milder symptoms and changing standards about what severity of illness merits a sick day mean that many Covid-infected workers are powering through, muting themselves on Zoom to cough, sneeze or blow their noses as they muddle through the day.

In contrast, the personal lives of faculty, staff and administrators continue uninterrupted. Apparently Covid is a threat only to the young who can easily be bullied into submission.

The buyer, whose identity couldn’t be determined, was represented by Chris Huddleston of The Sher Group. Mr. Huddleston didn’t respond to requests for comment.

It is startling when two speeches within 24 hours, neither much heralded in advance—the second wouldn’t even have been given without the first—leave you knowing you have witnessed a seminal moment in the history of an administration, but it happened this week. The president’s Tuesday speech in Atlanta, on voting rights, was a disaster for him. By the end of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s answering speech on Wednesday you knew some new break point had occurred, that President Biden might have thought he was just crooning to part of his base but the repercussions were greater than that; he was breaking in some new way with others—and didn’t know it. It is poor political practice when you fail to guess the effects of your actions. He meant to mollify an important constituency but instead he filled his opponents with honest indignation and, I suspect, encouraged in that fractured group some new unity. 
The speech itself was aggressive, intemperate, not only offensive but meant to offend. It seemed prepared by people who think there is only the Democratic Party in America, that’s it, everyone else is an outsider who can be disparaged. It was a mistake on so many levels. Presidents more than others in politics have to maintain an even strain, as astronauts used to say. If a president is rhetorically manipulative and divisive on a voting-rights bill it undercuts what he’s trying to establish the next day on Covid and the economy. The over-the-top language of the speech made him seem more emotional, less competent. The portentousness—“In our lives and . . . the life of our nation, there are moments so stark that they divide all that came before them from everything that followed. They stop time”—made him appear incapable of understanding how the majority of Americans understand our own nation’s history and the vast array of its challenges.

Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are a lot like sneaker drops: They come in limited quantities, depend on sky-high demand and stir speculative crazes in the resale market. It should come as no surprise, then, that  Nike ,  Adidas and  Under Armour  have dipped their toes into the market. Can they hit the ground running?
NFTs are digital assets—art, videos, anything that can exist digitally—that are tradable but not “fungible,” meaning they are unique and can’t be exchanged for an identical asset. A dollar or barrel of oil is fungible, a piece of art or a home isn’t. For brands like Nike or Adidas, NFTs could take the form of a collectible digital sneaker or one that an owner might actually wear in the virtual realm—say, in a videogame or in the metaverse. In some cases, an NFT comes with both the digital shoe and the right to a future delivery of a real one, serving as a kind of tradable ticket for the physical product.

When stardom hits in “Belle,” it does so with otherworldly force—a teenage singer’s debut concert draws a crowd of approximately 200 million. The venue really is otherworldly, though, a virtual-reality site called U, and the newly minted diva is an avatar named Belle, the glittering cyberspace projection of an unhappy high-schooler, Suzu, who lives her real-world life in a small rural town in Japan. This ambitious anime feature by Mamoru Hosoda juxtaposes the two worlds as Suzu makes her way through a troubled adolescence, and the story includes an elaborate riff on “Beauty and the Beast.” There’s too much plot for the film to manage, but its heart, and sumptuous art, are so firmly in the right place that its appeal comes through sweet and clear. (A GKIDS production, “Belle” is playing in theaters in a subtitled version, which I saw for review, and also in a dubbed version, which might be more accessible for young audiences.)
In Mr. Hosoda’s previous feature, the 2018 Oscar-nominated “Mirai,” the 4-year-old hero, Kun, is lonely because his baby sister has taken his place at the center of his family. Suzu’s sadness has deeper roots; she’s been inconsolable since her mother died years ago. Kun’s loneliness grows until he comes upon a magic garden where he encounters visitors from his family’s past and future alike. Suzu’s refuge is more contemporary, evoking the sort of metaverse alternatives to mere reality that Google, Apple, Oculus and who-knows-whatulus may be cooking up for our online future.

Then she would drive 45 minutes to her home in Glen Lyn, Va., and do her second job—which was supposed to be her only job—compiling data for the hospital’s quality department.

China is once again in the throes of a determined government attempt to rein in housing prices, boost domestic consumption and reduce dependence on the outside world. Why is this all so hard?
There are many answers, but some researchers are increasingly focusing on one intriguing piece of the puzzle: China has far too many young men relative to women, and that distorts its economy in subtle and powerful ways. The combination of China’s now-abandoned one-child policy, originally implemented in the 1980s, and a traditional preference for male children has pushed China’s sex ratio continually higher. In the late ’90s there were roughly equal numbers of men and women in their 20s, but by 2020 there were about 111 men for every 100 women, according to official data.

OTTAWA—The premier of the Canadian province of Quebec said his government would impose a tax on citizens who refuse to get vaccinated for Covid-19.
Quebec Premier Francois Legault said Tuesday the tax is necessary because the unvaccinated, who make up about 15% of the province’s 8.6 million people, are taking up roughly half of the acute-care beds in provincial hospitals and have become a drain on the healthcare system.

THE BEAUTY OF travel has always been its unpredictability but, in the Covid era, unpredictable has taken on new meaning. In November 2021, finding myself able to travel again and desperate to escape the sensory deprivation tank that has been Covid living, I chose my first destination: the small town of Delphi, perched on the side of Mount Parnassus in central Greece. I went to that shrine of knowledge and prediction because, if the past two years have shown us anything, it’s that we really have no idea what the future holds. I needed to see something, anything, that I hadn’t seen before. I also wanted to understand how the ancients had dealt with their crises of doubt and anxiety and the basic human inability to see what’s coming.
Delphi is where the uncertain have always gone to ease their uncertainty, a place of pilgrimage since before recorded history. One of the first travel writers, Pausanias, described it extensively in his tourist guide to the ancient world, around 1,800 years ago. Scholars consider the roughly 100-mile-long walk from Athens to Delphi’s Temple of Apollo among the oldest continuously used footpaths in the world. It’s one of the first trips people took with the goal of trying to figure things out.

No self-respecting barfly drinks well scotch, which is one pearl of wisdom cast by Ben Affleck’s Uncle Charlie in “The Tender Bar,” drawn from the memoir of J.R. Moehringer and directed by George Clooney. Generic booze is, in its way, a shortcut, something pretending to be something else—something achieved through time, effort and expense. As such, it’s not a bad analogy for this movie.
Based on Mr. Moehringer’s recollections of his ’80s boyhood on Long Island, N.Y.—and his early dream of being a writer and the influence thereupon of his blue-collar poet/saloonkeeper uncle—the film is set in and around the Dickens, a joint that suggests both “Cheers” and “The Iceman Cometh.” It has the depth of neither. You can’t really call the characters clichés, since they come out of Mr. Moehringer’s real-life recollections, but they’re treated that way by Mr. Clooney and his screenwriter, William Monahan (“The Departed”). Director and writer have tried to jam too much autobiography into a conventional feature and wound up with a series of vignettes. The people are so familiar, and the storyline so recycled, that we viewers reflexively fill in the copious blanks in both narrative and atmosphere. But it’s like bringing our own mortar to the filmmakers’ collection of bricks.

On Wednesday, White ranked fourth among Americans, was trying to lock down a discretionary bid on the U.S. men’s halfpipe team after dropping out of a recent event with lingering symptoms from a Covid-19 infection. He’d hopped a flight to Switzerland (after passing a Covid test), where he’d have one last chance this week to secure his world ranking and make the team. A few other U.S. riders also went to the Laax (Switzerland) Open in a final effort to earn rankings points.

The first threat to democracy was the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by “forces that attempted a coup.” The other threat comes from election reforms passed in 2021 by GOP state legislators who the president said want “to suppress your vote, to subvert our elections.”

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires large businesses to mandate employee vaccinations and imposes hefty fines for failure to comply.

Despite Wednesday’s inflation report indicating that consumer prices have risen by 7% over the past 12 months and accelerated to 9.1% over the past three months, the president and Democrats other than Sen. Joe Manchin remain firmly entrenched in a state of denial. In their telling, this inflation has nothing to do with their spending policy. This is the same argument we heard in the mid-1970s. 
When we both began our careers in public service, the U.S. was suffering from the high inflation of the late 1970s. The federal government had squandered a decade in denying that its policies had anything to do with inflation. Politicians made convenient scapegoats out of big oil, big banks, big communications and even big grocers. Government made the problem worse with price controls, investigations into price fixing and antitrust actions. It embarrassed itself with WIN (Whip Inflation Now) buttons and Inflation Gardens. Mounting voter outrage finally ended the charade.

Miramax, the producers of the 1994 film, filed a suit in November in U.S. District Court in California against Mr. Tarantino alleging copyright infringement and breach of contract. Mr. Tarantino’s camp claims he does have the rights for the NFTs.

American workers can be grateful for small favors. They finally received a raise in December, even if it was only 0.1% after inflation. At least that beats the decline of 2.4% in real wages over the entire year. That’s how much inflation has eroded the American standard of living and how it turned 2021 into a lost year for the average worker.
The Labor Department said Wednesday that the consumer-price index rose 0.5% in December, or 7% in the last year. That’s the highest annual rate since 1982, when Paul Volcker was trying to wring inflation out of the economy with Ronald Reagan’s political support. The current inflation has caught the Federal Reserve and Biden Administration entirely by surprise, and they’re still not sure what to do about it other than to blame someone else.

A former unit of student-loan giant Sallie Mae said it would cancel $1.7 billion in private student debt for about 66,000 borrowers to resolve claims that it engaged in deceptive lending practices.
 Navient  Corp. , a student-loan servicer that split off from Sallie Mae in 2014, agreed to the sum in a settlement with 40 state attorneys general. The loans are private loans, so the losses will be covered by Navient’s investors rather than the federal government.

Before the pandemic, Caroline Casey, 45, a Minneapolis-based consultant says her work responsibilities sometimes bled into her weekends. But since she stopped working in an office, Casey’s workday has morphed into a 24/7 schedule, with clients in different cities and time zones. As she sees it, part of the unofficial compensation package for that lifestyle should be a chance to cut out a little early on a Friday and grab a Mimosa and some food. Casey is one of the growing number of people who have discovered the joys of the Friday brunch.
“I want ‘I am having a beer at 11 a.m. on Friday’ to be the gesture of luxury that those of us without subsidized health care get for our precarity,” says Casey.

TORONTO—Major oil companies, under pressure from investors and environmentalists, are fleeing Canada’s oil sands, the fourth-largest oil reserve in the world and by some measures one of the most environmentally unfriendly. Investment in existing projects has stalled, and banks are refusing to fund new ones.
Nevertheless, oil production there is expected to continue for at least two more decades. Local companies have stepped in to keep working the existing mines and wells. Last year, the oil sands were on track to deliver more oil than ever.

For workers, it is great news: the U.S. labor market is nearing, or may already be at, its ideal state of “full employment.” But for the economy as a whole, it risks introducing a new source of upward pressure on inflation. 
Full employment refers to a labor market in which just about anyone who wants a job can get one, without wages and prices rising out of control. It is the ideal of a healthy, steadily growing economy. In theory, once employment passes that level, wage pressures start to build which employers may pass along in prices.

The actor and director Fred Savage is a lifelong watch collector, the sort of enthusiast who frequents watch auctions in his spare time. So when he was working as an executive producer and director on “The Wonder Years,” the recent ABC reboot of the classic coming-of-age show in which he starred in the 1980s, he wanted the characters to wear watches authentic to the series’s 1960s setting. For that he turned to his friend Eric Wind, a former senior watch specialist at Christie’s and now an independent watch dealer in Palm Beach, Fla.
Mr. Wind primarily peddles rare Rolex and Patek Philippe watches to private collectors, but in recent years, he’s carved out a niche facilitating watch loans for movies and TV shows including “Crazy Rich Asians” and FX’s “The Premise”—a key player in a subculture that fixates on the intersection between horology and pop-culture and has ripple effects for watch marketing, watch blogs and watch collectors.

Today, the inflation rate is on the rise. Back then, it was falling. It had peaked at 14.8% in 1980, while Jimmy Carter was still president and the Iranian revolution had pushed up oil prices. Core inflation that year reached 13.6%.

Alice Becker and Duncan Threadgould fell in love with the Cotswolds during a weekend away before the pandemic. This 787 square miles of protected countryside, the northern tip of which is a convenient 75 miles north of central London, has long been a fashionable place for frazzled urbanites to take a weekend break. But Ms. Becker and Mr. Threadgould wanted more of its lush landscape and sophisticated nightlife than a short break could provide.
Back in 2018, Ms. Becker, 42, was living in central London and Mr. Threadgould, 48, had an apartment in a southwest London suburb. They decided that Mr. Threadgould, an IT consultant, would rent a house in the north Cotswolds so they could try the area before making a final decision on whether to decamp there permanently.

Over the past two years, China has used some of the strictest measures anywhere to keep Covid-19 out and long succeeded in holding numbers down. But as Omicron poses the biggest challenge since the start of the pandemic, the country is looking more boxed in by its own formula.
Beijing has repeatedly pointed to Western countries where the virus has run rampant as cautionary examples. But as the Omicron variant spreads inside China ahead of February’s 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, an uncomfortable reality is setting in: The country’s ability to keep the virus at bay has meant low levels of natural immunity. Vaccination rates are high, but how effective Chinese vaccines are against Omicron remains in question.

Over the past two generations, the share of Americans with four-year college degrees has more than doubled, and a new class of well-educated upper-middle-income professionals has emerged as a potent social and political force. 
By and large, members of this new class have risen higher through education and mastered its rules. They do well on standardized tests, they get good grades, and they forge relationships with professors and other mentors that serve them well throughout their careers. Although some have taken advantage of family connections (through “legacy admissions” to universities, for example), many owe their advancement to their talents and skills. They insist they have achieved their position through their own efforts.

THEN: Even during the late World War II years, Canada, far from European and Pacific combat, had a relatively strong consumer economy. That helped make Chalet Bar-B-Q—the Montreal restaurant focused on rotisserie chicken that Swiss visionary Marcel Mauron conceived in 1944—an instant success. The chickens were cooked in the middle of the dining room and the menu was precise: You could order anything you wanted as long as it was chicken, french fries, dipping sauce, coleslaw and apple pie, and you consumed it amid knotty pine paneling and framed Alpine scenes.

U.S. sentencing guidelines, which judges must consider, recommend the equivalent of life in prison for offenders found guilty of fraud conspiracies as large as Ms. Holmes’s, based on the amount she raised from investors during the scheme.

On the other, a brand-new, modern glass mansion is a nod to Miami’s recent influx of the international superrich. The asking price for both? A cool $90 million. 
If the estate sells for that price, it will be the most expensive residential property ever sold in the Miami area, topping a $75 million purchase by hedge funder Ken Griffin last month.

The Tennessee Titans don’t have Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes or Josh Allen. But when the NFL playoffs begin this weekend, they have a phenomenal advantage that Super Bowl favorites like the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Kansas City Chiefs or Buffalo Bills don’t: the Titans get the weekend off. 
The league added a seventh playoff team from each conference last year, and that changed the format in a way that provides a monumental reward to only two teams. The winner of each conference gets both home-field advantage and the lone first-round bye, meaning its path to the Super Bowl has one fewer chance to lose.

‘Follow the science,” we keep hearing, but sometimes scientists and the media present findings in a misleading way. Consider a new study by Duke University’s ABC Science Collaborative, conducted in partnership with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. Researchers examined the effect of a “test to stay” approach to schoolchildren identified as “close contacts” of Covid-positive people. Test to stay excuses these children from quarantining if they test negative for the virus. The study’s primary conclusion was that test to stay is a good way to move away from lengthy quarantine.
That’s reasonable and useful. But the researchers peppered their report with rhetorical sleights of hand aimed at misleading readers into other, less well-founded conclusions that were mostly inevitable products of their own study design. One of their primary conclusions is that “in schools with universal masking, test-to-stay is an effective strategy.” That invites readers to assume that test-to-stay doesn’t work without forced masking. But since they studied no unmasked schools, this conclusion is baseless. An honest report would either have said so or not mentioned masking at all.

Mr. Biden’s speech in Georgia was a call to bulldoze the Senate’s filibuster to pass a rebranded version of H.R.1, a bill that would impose a federal election code on all 50 states, including forcing them to count late mail ballots that lack postmarks. If you happen to think that’s a bad idea, or that it’s unconstitutional, or that nuking the filibuster would hurt the Senate, well, then apparently you’re against Abraham Lincoln.

The Omicron variant accounted for 98% of Covid-19 cases in the U.S. last week, based on estimates released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tuesday. The variant has fueled a rapid rise in infections since reaching the U.S. late last year, surpassing surges associated with earlier versions of the virus and almost eliminating Delta.
So far, the rate of hospitalizations associated with Omicron doesn’t appear as high as with prior variants, lending support to early studies indicating Omicron might be less severe than other variants. However, the sheer number of Omicron cases has led to the seven-day average of new hospital patients with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 cases running above last January’s record highs.

Scholastic Corp. was attempting an overhaul of its websites with the goal of creating a single online identity for its many divisions, which had each gone in its own direction. When the effort hit the skids in 2017, then-Chief Executive 









      
      Richard Robinson



       sent in Iole Lucchese to put it on track. Ms. Lucchese, chief strategy officer at the time, called the prior management team’s website work “f—ed up” during a staff meeting, and said she would be taking over, according to people who attended.

Scholastic still hasn’t accomplished that goal of a unified online destination. It has at least six websites aimed at teachers alone. The effort joined a graveyard of digital projects at the publishing company known for titles such as the “Harry Potter” series, “Clifford the Big Red Dog” and “The Hunger Games.” Ms. Lucchese, 55, is now in an even more influential position. Mr. Robinson’s will bequeathed his controlling stake in the company to her when he died in June. The board named her chair in July. The two had been longtime romantic partners, The Wall Street Journal reported last year.






Scholastic’s titles include Suzanne Collins’s ‘The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.’

Ms. Lucchese must now fix problems that have plagued Scholastic’s innovation efforts—and find continued growth despite the pandemic—while facing skepticism among some current and former employees over whether her track record augurs well for her leadership. She must do so while also confronting resistance to her ascension from Mr. Robinson’s family and questions among some employees about whether her 31-year career at the company was boosted by her relationship with the boss. Among her skeptics are some former board members and executives who say Scholastic fell short of expectations on several digital initiatives during her time as chief strategy officer from 2014. Various company efforts during her tenure to harness sales data and find ways to sell directly to consumers—to add to its existing businesses through schools—haven't come to fruition, they said. Ms. Lucchese’s supporters, who also include some former Scholastic executives, said she had brought bold ideas to the company, some of which Mr. Robinson stymied with his cautiousness. Though she had oversight of many digital initiatives that faltered, they said, she didn’t have day-to-day responsibility for them. “I don’t think there is anything but competency” behind Mr. Robinson’s passing the reins to Ms. Lucchese, said Rick Richter, a former president of Simon & Schuster’s children’s division and now a partner in the literary agency Aevitas Creative Management. “The one thing you could say about Dick is he was no fool,” said Mr. Richter. Among Ms. Lucchese’s achievements “was holding down the fort during one of the most catastrophic situations in Scholastic’s history,” he said, referring to Ms. Lucchese’s leadership efforts during the pandemic following Mr. Robinson’s death. Scholastic declined to make senior executives available for interviews, including Ms. Lucchese and CEO 









      
      Peter Warwick.



       Mr. Warwick last year told the Journal he was working closely with Ms. Lucchese. Scholastic spokeswoman Anne Sparkman said Ms. Lucchese’s focus on strengthening the brand was instrumental to the company’s success and evolution, and her digital accomplishments include creating an e-gift card and teacher crowdfunding tool that have increased opportunities to bring in revenue. “As Chief Strategy Officer, she developed and brought in key staff, increased collaboration and efficiency across the company,” Ms. Sparkman said, adding that Scholastic’s digital strategy remains a work in progress.

Scholastic has been a stalwart in American publishing for more than 100 years. The issues facing Ms. Lucchese and other senior managers at Scholastic have been a long time in the making, said Jon Newcomb, a publishing consultant and equity investor. Scholastic “spent a lot of energy investing in the ed tech business, then sold it, leaving a lot of good people disillusioned,” he said. “Dick Robinson inspired a lot of loyalty, but it also led to a hardening of the arteries. There hasn’t been enough innovation.” Ms. Sparkman declined to comment. Ms. Lucchese, with Mr. Warwick, is steering Scholastic to a recovery after school closures hit its business. Revenue fell 12.6% to $1.3 billion in the fiscal year that ended in May and is rebounding. Scholastic stock is up 11% since Mr. Robinson’s death and up 65% in the past year, versus 24% for the S&P 500 index as of Jan. 11, according to FactSet data. That partly reflects investors’ belief that the company might be sold, said Lorraine Shanley, president of industry consultants Market Partners International Inc. “Scholastic has some fantastic franchises,” she said. Scholastic’s Ms. Sparkman declined to speculate on a possible sale. Scholastic’s recent successes include last year’s release of a live-action Clifford movie, which Ms. Lucchese co-produced. A sequel is in development with 










            ViacomCBS Inc.’s


       Paramount Pictures, Scholastic’s partner on the movie. “The company has a history of evolving—from classroom magazines to book clubs to blockbuster trade with a side bet on education tossed into the mix,” said Gus Oliver, a longtime Scholastic board member until 2015 whose family helped bankroll the company in its early years. “Whether Iole and Peter will find a way to survive and thrive in the digital era—a huge opportunity that Scholastic has missed thus far—remains to be seen.” Mr. Robinson’s two sons have been exploring grounds to challenge Ms. Lucchese’s ascension, the Journal reported in November, including the claim that their father had promised controlling shares to them as part of a loan agreement. Scholastic has no evidence of such an agreement, said the spokeswoman, Ms. Sparkman.‘Creative force’ Ms. Lucchese joined Scholastic’s Canada division in 1991 as an associate editor in book clubs. Andriana Avraam, a veteran Scholastic Canada staffer who today operates a Toronto-based events company, described Ms. Lucchese as “a creative force who loved connecting with parents, teachers and children and believed deeply in Scholastic’s mission.” Relatively early in her career, Ms. Lucchese began a romance with Mr. Robinson, and word of the relationship spread in the company. Ms. Lucchese became Scholastic Canada’s co-president in 2003 and soon became a frequent presence at the New York headquarters, where Mr. Robinson would ask her to join meetings outside her job title’s scope, former staffers said. Scholastic’s Ms. Sparkman said it is normal for a rising executive to be part of cross-divisional meetings.

Ms. Lucchese around 2010 started playing an advisory role on an e-reader application called Storia, meant to be Scholastic’s weapon against 










            Amazon.com Inc.’s


       dominance in e-reading. The app was designed to let families buy books and make reading more gamelike. Storia faltered because of poor technology, and Scholastic struggled to acquire digital book rights to stock the app, staffers who worked on it said. Several Scholastic executives were already involved in the development, and Ms. Lucchese’s input made for a confused leadership structure, they said. Scholastic narrowed Storia’s scope by 2014 to focus on school customers. Scholastic’s Ms. Sparkman said that Storia was an ambitious project that didn’t work out as expected and that the technology was applied to other products. Mr. Robinson named Ms. Lucchese chief strategy officer in 2014, surprising many staffers because she didn’t have an extensive digital background. One colleague said Ms. Lucchese confided that: “I’m still trying to figure out what I own and what I’m responsible for.” At least one director, Mae Jemison, expressed concern when the issue of Mr. Robinson’s dating an employee came up in a board committee meeting. “It became clear Dick was involved with somebody in the company who was in his direct line of authority,” said Dr. Jemison, an educator, former astronaut and longtime board member until 2015, “and I really expressed my concern about the appropriateness.” She said she retains “tremendous respect” for Mr. Robinson’s leadership and high regard for Scholastic’s support of children and education. She also said she wasn’t familiar with Ms. Lucchese’s work.

Scholastic’s Ms. Sparkman said the company advises employees on the risks of dating subordinates and co-workers but doesn’t prohibit such relationships.Tech selloff Among Ms. Lucchese’s first acts in her new role was to express support for Mr. Robinson to sell a group of educational-technology businesses, including a popular platform called Read 180, people familiar with the deliberations said. In 2015, Scholastic sold the technology to 










            Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Co.


       for $575 million. While most directors approved, Dr. Jemison said she opposed selling technology that could underpin future innovations. Some former executives agree with Dr. Jemison’s assessment, saying that parting with key talent and technology as part of the sale may have ultimately hindered Scholastic’s innovation efforts. Some former digital staffers said they were disappointed by Ms. Lucchese’s decision to de-emphasize Scholastic’s free online content geared toward teachers—such as lesson plans and teacher-written blogs—to focus the website more on commerce. That led to declines in traffic and digital-ad revenue and took away helpful content that attracted teachers to the site, they said. Scholastic’s Ms. Sparkman said Ms. Lucchese took needed steps to clean up website content and invest in digital marketing efforts that ultimately increased traffic to the entire Scholastic site. She added that the site continues to offer free teaching tools. Ms. Lucchese encouraged Mr. Robinson in 2017 to acquire Ooka Island, a Canadian virtual reading app, former staffers said. The app struggled to win customers among schools, they said, and its technology didn’t turn out to be useful across other lines of business as Scholastic had hoped.

“This was a product that was decades old and the graphics and interface reflected its age,” said Kathy Walsh, then Scholastic’s executive director of marketing and teacher outreach, who is now retired. Scholastic’s Ms. Sparkman said Ms. Lucchese supported the acquisition but the education division’s leadership identified the opportunity. Scholastic later rebranded the app as Scholastic F.I.R.S.T., which has shown a 126% growth in revenue since 2018 and has won several education technology awards, she said. Ms. Lucchese was gaining a reputation internally as outspoken and blunt, many current and former employees said. Some former staffers said they considered her use of the F-word at the 2017 meeting unseemly because staff were still reeling from the company’s firing of some digital executives in charge of the website overhaul. The former staffers said they considered her profanity-laced comments as a violation of traditional Scholastic decorum. “We had just lost some colleagues,” said Nancy Cross Shimmel, a former Scholastic website editor who was there. “It was so inappropriate and disrespectful.” Scholastic’s Ms. Sparkman said Ms. Lucchese declined to comment on the meeting. In 2018, Mr. Robinson promoted Ms. Lucchese to president of entertainment. She sought to create shows using Scholastic’s intellectual property, including the “Puppy Place” series on 










            Apple Inc.’s


       Apple TV+. She went on the Clifford movie set often, watching daily cuts of unedited film and offering suggestions to make the movie true to the book, staffers who worked with her said.

Tensions flared from time to time between her and Mr. Robinson over their approach to innovation, former executives said. Ms. Lucchese supported the concept of a monthly book-box subscription Scholastic was considering that would mail a selection of titles directly to families, former staffers said. Mr. Robinson demurred, saying it would be costly to move goods outside Scholastic’s distribution network of schools. Scholastic never launched the initiative. Ms. Lucchese and Mr. Robinson appeared to break up for good in 2019, the Journal reported last year. Their work relationship took on a more contentious tone, former staffers said. Ms. Sparkman disputed that they had a contentious relationship. Scholastic didn’t complete a business-wide digital-transformation plan launched in 2017 and called “Scholastic 2020,” of which Ms. Lucchese was a leader, people familiar with the initiative said. The company still can’t easily assess the sales performance of a J.K. Rowling title like “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets” across divisions that have long kept their own data, these people said. It is also difficult for Scholastic to track a single consumer across divisions. Scholastic’s Ms. Sparkman said the company followed through on some Scholastic 2020 projects, including technology upgrades and cost-cutting measures, that helped position it well during the pandemic.New vision Since Mr. Robinson’s death, Ms. Lucchese in executive meetings has outlined a vision for a different Scholastic—more focused on families and teachers as end consumers and not tied only to school infrastructure, people familiar with the discussions said. In November, the company named board member Mary Beech as chief marketing and transformation officer, largely to aid direct-to-consumer efforts. Ms. Beech’s task includes helping Scholastic harness its data to understand consumers.

Ms. Lucchese has supported a digital plan, “One Scholastic,” that would once again seek to knit together its divisions—such as education, book clubs, international, trade publishing, and book fairs—across marketing, data analytics and digital offerings. A longtime board member called the divisions “feudal kingdoms,” saying Ms. Lucchese has been effective over the years—and since Mr. Robinson’s death—at forging relationships that could help enable companywide change. “She was a very good strategist, and I think she gained because of the romantic relationship,” said Linda Lee, a former vice president who worked at the company from 1997 to 2019 and now does freelance consulting. “Even after the romance was over, Dick still trusted her, and that was because she really was someone who came along that had a good vision for the company.” Write to Shalini Ramachandran at shalini.ramachandran@wsj.com and Jeffrey A.

My late parents, whose rocky divorce occurred in the 1970s when their three children were still in grade school, didn’t agree on much. But they did agree on Sidney Poitier, who died last week at 94.

But for millions of black people of Poitier’s generation, when dignified depictions of blacks in motion pictures were still scarce, his most famous roles—the detective in “In the Heat of the Night,” the teacher in “To Sir, With Love,” the doctor in “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” the handyman in “Lilies of the Field”—epitomized how a black man should carry himself.

As the Supreme Court observed in 1964, “the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is preservative of other basic civil and political rights.” Enacted in 1965, the Voting Rights Act helped black and minority voters realize more fully the voting rights the Constitution extends to all Americans. As one of the legislators who helped lead congressional reauthorization of the law in 1982 and 2005, I urge Congress to restore important provisions of the Voting Rights Act while rejecting efforts to eviscerate its protections for rank partisan gain.
The bipartisan history of the law affirms the foundational constitutional principles it protects. In 1965, the Senate approved the Voting Rights Act 77-19; the House 333-85. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, John Lewis and other leaders of the civil-rights movement attended the bill signing.

Federal Judge Claude Hilton will hear complaints on Jan. 18 from Asian-American parents in Fairfax County, Va., who are upset with the new admissions policy at Thomas Jefferson High School. Though it has received little attention, the case draws back the curtain on how race is being used to discriminate against Asian-Americans. In so doing it also underscores what is at stake in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, an appeal of which the Supreme Court is considering whether to hear. 
The allegation in both cases is the same: The schools want fewer Asian-Americans so they can make room for black, Latino and white applicants who are less qualified on the merits. Before the change, Thomas Jefferson was about 70% Asian-American. The big difference is that Thomas Jefferson is a public school and Harvard is private.

America’s current crisis with Russia over Ukraine is a logical outcome of the Biden administration’s failed European policy and misguided focus on consensus. This standoff, which may culminate in January with concessions to Moscow, is the product of five basic problems.
First and most glaring, the administration has treated diplomacy with Western Europe as an end in itself. America’s current fetish for agreement with Berlin and Paris, rather than transactional diplomacy, means that on issue after issue the Germans and French can insist on their own policy views in exchange for consensus. For countries that don’t view Russia’s military buildup with sufficient alarm, consensus means words rather than action. The European Union has failed to draft sanctions on Russia even as the crisis enters its third month. The Germans are reportedly blocking the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from selling lethal aid to Ukraine. And Germany was insistent on completing Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will effectively isolate Ukraine.

That is one taste of the unconventional advice in the year’s new fitness books, which zero in on the brain’s role in exercise and ways that movement can improve cognitive function and mental health. Several books explore not only how movement affects the brain, but also how the brain affects movement, offering ideas about mindfulness during workouts or tricks to short-circuit the brain’s barriers to exercise. (The Gatorade swish, one book theorizes, misleads the brain into thinking the system is getting a jolt of energy from a sugary beverage, even if it isn’t.)

In case you think falling popularity has Democrats questioning their progressive agenda, guess again. California Democrats are busy reviving government-run, single-payer health care, despite its failure in the state five years ago. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom campaigned on single-payer in 2018, and it passed the state Senate in 2017. But it collapsed in the more conservative Assembly because it didn’t include funding to pay for its estimated $400 billion annual cost. It also would have required Medicare and Medicaid waivers from the Trump Health and Human Services Department. Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon called the bill “woefully incomplete.”

Georgia didn’t play a single game in which it wasn’t the favorite during the 2021 season. And yet its quarterback, Stetson Bennett IV, didn’t play a single game in which he wasn’t an underdog—none more important than Monday night’s College Football Championship rematch against Alabama.
Bennett was a walk-on who never saw his relegation to the lower rungs of the depth chart as the final verdict on his potential. Four years ago, he bet on himself by leaving Georgia—his dream school—for a junior-college gig, where he put up statistics that might earn him an athletic scholarship. He later returned to Georgia, swapping out his smartphone for a flip phone to block out the noise as he jockeyed for playing time against five-star recruits.

U.S. hospitals are caring for the highest number of patients with Covid-19 reported during the pandemic, according to federal government data, as the Omicron variant worsens pressures on the already strained facilities.
The U.S. seven-day average reached 140,576 people hospitalized with confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, more than the previous high recorded during the surge last winter, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data.

The Omicron variant is spreading across the globe, but so far the strain appears to be less deadly than its predecessors. That’s good news, but here’s a risk that policy makers in every country should appreciate: Policies designed to slow the spread of Omicron may end up creating a supervariant that is more infectious, more virulent and more resistant to vaccines. That would be a man-made disaster.
To minimize that risk, policy makers must tolerate the rapid spread of milder variants. This will require difficult trade-offs, but it will save lives in the long run. We should end mask mandates and social distancing in most settings not because they don’t slow the spread—the usual argument against such measures—but because they probably do.

ATLANTA—President Biden put his weight behind congressional Democrats’ push to pass long-stalled elections bills, even if it requires changing Senate rules, in a speech Tuesday designed to build support for the imperiled legislation with votes just days away.
While House and Senate Democrats support the proposals, the bills need 60 votes to advance in the 50-50 Senate. Both are expected to fall well short of that mark due to opposition from GOP lawmakers, prompting a parallel effort by Democrats to change the filibuster procedure to ease their passage. But two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have resisted such an approach, leaving any progress uncertain.

In Latin America, delivering a second booster allows Chile and Brazil to reinforce less-effective Chinese-made vaccines on which they relied. Israel, meanwhile, is seeking higher levels of protection with a fourth dose of the  Pfizer Inc. - BioNTech  SE vaccine after those with a third began losing immunity within a few months.

Most of us in our 20s and 30s are familiar with the rhythms of friend-group life changes. First, people find their long-term relationships, and in each case you hear all the dish about who this new person is, and you vet them to make sure they’re a fit match for your beloved friend. Then, the couple moves in together, so you help assemble new furniture and attend the housewarming party. After that, maybe there’s a wedding—or, in the past couple of years, a Zoom ceremony—and you clink Champagne and make teary-eyed toasts. 
Everyone knows what comes next: Wait a couple of years, and your calendar will start filling up with invitations to baby showers and sip and sees, and you find yourself shopping for teensy shoes and picture books and other gifts appropriate for new parents.

In our series My Monday Morning, self-motivated people tell WSJ. how they start off the week.
On Mondays, Olivier Rousteing, the creative director of the French fashion house Balmain, wakes up around 6:30 a.m. He drinks a succession of beverages—green tea, lemon juice and orange juice—and eats a breakfast of eggs and avocado. While the designer, 36, is an avid boxer, Mondays and Saturdays are the days when his yoga teacher comes over and leads him in a meditation instead. The more serene practice is how Rousteing prefers to start the week, perhaps because he doesn’t take any time off during the weekends. Saturday and Sunday are his most creative days, he says, and he spends them working alone in his office. “It’s on the sixth floor of the building,” he says. “I’m the only one on the floor, and I can see all of Paris.”

Some commentators saw Russia’s deployment of “peacekeeping forces” to Kazakhstan last week as a setback for Vladimir Putin. It showed his weakness, they said. His troop deployments near Ukraine’s border were failing, and new popular uprisings could topple autocrats in other former Soviet republics, complicating the Russian president’s strategic calculations.
The unspoken corollary to this theorizing is that the last thing America or Europe should do is take provocative action regarding Ukraine or other countries caught in the gray zone between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s eastern borders and Russia’s western ones. Kazakhstan is a Kremlin problem where “America has no real leverage,” as Politico put this instant conventional wisdom. Predictably, the State Department’s first reaction to the Kazakh crisis was moral equivalency, calling “for restraint by both the authorities and protestors.”

The actor and director Fred Savage is a lifelong watch collector, the sort of enthusiast who frequents watch auctions in his spare time. So when he was working as an executive producer and director on “The Wonder Years,” the recent ABC reboot of the classic coming-of-age show in which he starred in the 1980s, he wanted the characters to wear watches authentic to the series’s 1960s setting. For that he turned to his friend Eric Wind, a former senior watch specialist at Christie’s and now an independent watch dealer in Palm Beach, Fla.
Mr. Wind primarily peddles rare Rolex and Patek Philippe watches to private collectors, but in recent years, he’s carved out a niche facilitating watch loans for movies and TV shows including “Crazy Rich Asians” and FX’s “The Premise”—a key player in a subculture that fixates on the intersection between horology and pop-culture and has ripple effects for watch marketing, watch blogs and watch collectors.

Economic globalization was supposed to make wars harder to start. What if the experience with Russia right now is demonstrating that globalization actually makes them harder to prevent?
For at least the last decade, a prevailing theory in international affairs has been that economic interdependence across the globe makes conflicts less likely. If everybody is tied together economically as never before, then everybody would suffer from large-scale conflict. Therefore, nobody would take that chance lightly. Economic ties would help ensure peace.

Paranoia, in our time at least, is the better part of valor. Our time is a time of rampant crime: muggings, carjackings, smash-and-grab store lootings, and random murder. I have not been directly affected by any of this marauding, but hearing about it on television and radio news, receiving online flashes about it on my cellphone and stories from friends, I find myself affected by it, as I suspect most people are.
The other night at 7, I left to pick up dinner at a restaurant less than 100 yards from our apartment building. I walked warily on the deserted street over to the restaurant, and when I returned, using my fob to get back into our building, I heard myself exhale a sigh of relief. I live in Evanston, Ill., the first suburb north of Chicago, traditionally a peaceful place once known as the land of the blue-rinse dowager.

Soon after 19-year-old Adele Lowitz gave up her  Apple  iPhone 11 for an experimental go with an Android smartphone, a friend in her long-running texting group chimed in: “Who’s green?”
The reference to the color of group text messages—Android users turn Apple Inc.’s iMessage into green bubbles instead of blue—highlighted one of the challenges of her experiment. No longer did her group chats work seamlessly with other peers, almost all of whom used iPhones. FaceTime calls became more complicated and the University of Michigan sophomore’s phone didn’t show up in an app she used to find friends.

Erine Cressell worked as a hospital nurse for 15 years, with dreams of finishing an advanced degree and treating patients with addiction issues in her corner of Appalachia. That was before the pandemic.
Beginning in 2020, she spent most of her days diverted to her hospital’s emergency room, tending to people who would have been admitted to the floors above, if only there was enough staff there to care for them. After her 12-hour shifts, she sometimes would sit on a curb in the hospital parking lot and cry. Then she would drive 45 minutes to her home in Glen Lyn, Va., and do her second job—which was supposed to be her only job—compiling data for the hospital’s quality department. Sneak in a little sleep, and repeat.

The decrees raise constitutional issues as well. But there’s a simpler reason the justices should stay these mandates: the rise of the Omicron variant.
It would be irrational, legally indefensible and contrary to the public interest for government to mandate vaccines absent any evidence that the vaccines are effective in stopping the spread of the pathogen they target. Yet that’s exactly what’s happening here.

Sitecore CEO Steve Tzikakis explains how companies can offer a more personalized digital experience.
 


Many companies had to adapt quickly to offer their goods and services online after the pandemic hit. Now they’re grappling with another challenge: how to offer personalized digital experiences even as the Big Tech firms sharply limit third-party collection of consumer data.
Steve Tzikakis, CEO of Sitecore, a global leader in digital experience management software, recently sat down with us to provide his insights about how companies are navigating these challenges and working to deliver a more engaged, satisfying digital-first experience.
Q: How did companies react to the lockdowns?
Steve Tzikakis: It’s easy to forget that only about 20% of global retail sales occur online. When the lockdown came, it immediately became apparent that many brands—even big, familiar brands—didn’t have an online strategy. They didn’t have customer data; they didn’t have a personalized experience on the internet. Immediately this became a topic for the boardroom and the CEO. Many CEOs seized the opportunity to digitally transform their businesses. Those that didn’t faced headwinds in their results.
Q: How has the customer experience changed in a digital-first world?
Tzikakis: It’s no longer about having a website and a commerce platform. You have to offer the same personalized experience, the same white-glove treatment for your customers, whether they’re online or offline. If you’re a supermarket or a bank, you’ve been working on this for years, but if you’re in clothing, luxury goods, automobiles or packaged goods, it’s a new thing. Many business-to-business companies also lacked online platforms or sophisticated experiences, and supply chains had to be redesigned. too.
Sitecore’s customers expected us to see them through the initial months of the crisis, and we took the opportunity to innovate and transform our own products and offerings. We’ve announced a €1.2 billion growth plan, and we’re hiring an additional 1,000 people to help accelerate that digital transformation for our customers.

Q: Were companies ready to do online commerce at scale?
Tzikakis: The lion’s share of our work is building content and helping our customers present their content in any format. Then we try to match that content with what the customer wants. That’s not easy with hundreds of thousands or even millions of consumers on your platform. Meanwhile, the number and types of devices are multiplying—smartphones, smart watches, smart TVs. You never know when or where the consumer will get to you, and you could go quickly from a few hundred visitors to hundreds of thousands.
Eventually, most purchases will be digital. There’s no going back. Even if markets opened fully tomorrow, we will have more hybrid experiences, for example, with more people walking into stores and then buying online in the store. So businesses need to be ready.
Q: What’s the biggest challenge to creating a personalized experience?
Tzikakis: Big Tech has made it clear we are moving to a world without third-party cookies. The advertising tech companies will no longer be providing customer data to our favorite brands, so the brands will have to hold their own customer data. Now, all of a sudden, your favorite brand or website is asking you for consent to collect your information.
Most people say no to that. But then there’s still an expectation when you go to a website that your favorite brand recognizes your preferences, where you live, what you like to buy, and so forth, so they can provide that unique experience. So now we spend a lot of our time educating the market, but also helping our customers build that first-party data.
Q: How can companies convince their customers to provide their data?
Tzikakis: Trust is important. It’s a little easier if you’re a big, recognized global brand, but harder if you’re a local brand or smaller business. You need to make clear that this is not data you hold and sell or keep on a USB stick somewhere. You also need to provide relevant services with that data—or people will stop giving you consent. If they give you the data, people expect personalized service and offers, not generic content. Companies should only consider collecting that data once they’re prepared to provide that customized service.
You can’t just say, “I’m going to offer 10 personalized views.” If you’re going to have 1 million visitors, you should be ready to provide 1 million views. This is the role of first-party data. Companies were rushed into this, but the good news is, now there’s no excuse. Everyone knows what they need to do. And once we’ve built first-party data with our customers, we’re going to be in a position to use other technologies like 5G and augmented reality. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are already part of the game, but there are many more things that can help the online experience.
Q: What would you advise companies that want to go digital-first quickly?
Tzikakis: First, this is a subject for the board. It's not just for marketing or IT—it’s for the whole leadership team working together. It’s the new norm. Strategic sponsorship from within is vital. Second, be guided by your consumers, and don't try to copy your competitors. Not everybody does it right. This is your opportunity to provide a one-of-a-kind online service. My recommendation to all of our customers is to trust your gut and consider your DNA, similar to how you invent new products or bring new services to the market. It has to be unique, as people want to see fresh ideas in the online world.

It took an improbable sequence of events late Sunday just to set the stage for an even more improbable possibility: that the Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angeles Chargers could play to a tie and ensure that they both made the NFL playoffs. 
Yet as the teams’ game wound down and the craziness amped up, all of the long shot possibilities were in play. The game went to overtime tied 29-29. The teams exchanged field goals to tie the game at 32. There were four minutes and 30 seconds separating the two teams from one of the most consequential ties in NFL history. 
 Then a last-second, overtime field goal—when a simple kneel down would have sent both teams to the playoffs—sailed through the uprights. There was no tie. The Las Vegas Raiders won. 
The incredible result sent the Raiders to the playoffs, ended the Chargers’ season and allowed everyone in Pittsburgh to collectively exhale, as the Steelers would have been the team excluded from the playoffs in the event of a tie.

The situation facing the Chargers and Raiders entering this weekend was the stuff of sports-bar fantasy. Both teams would get in the playoffs with a win. Both teams faced elimination with a loss. But there was a scenario in which both teams would get in with a tie. It set up crazy notions that the teams could kneel, spike and punt the ball back and forth with designs on a 0-0 tie. 
The scenario was always quite unlikely. It required the Jacksonville Jaguars upsetting the Indianapolis Colts as huge underdogs. It also needed the Steelers to beat the Baltimore Ravens.
Then the Jaguars somehow won. The Steelers won in overtime. The Tie Bowl was on. 
It turned a football game into a case study in behavioral economics. Each team had an enormous incentive—reaching the playoffs—to play for a tie from the beginning. But reality diverges when people don’t cooperate and act in their own self-interest—and still try to win. 
When the actual game began, both teams played normally. It was just another NFL game with a playoff berth on the line. The Raiders led 10-0. The Chargers went up 14-10. But by midway through the fourth quarter, Las Vegas led 29-14. It had a win probability of 98.8%, according to ESPN. 
Then Los Angeles quarterback Justin Herbert engineered a series of stunning conversions that breathed life into the Chargers season—and the possibility of a tie. 
On a 14-play drive, Herbert completed a six-yard pass on fourth-and-6 that got the first down but only after a replay review. Later, the Chargers faced fourth-and-21. Herbert completed a 23-yard pass for a touchdown. The 2-point conversion made it 29-22. 
It only got wilder on Los Angeles’s next drive. That was a 19-play, 83-yard affair in which the Chargers seemed to forget about the first three downs. They converted three fourth-and-10s en route to sending the game to overtime with a last-second touchdown.

That’s when an outcome that required a case of beer to take seriously suddenly became a sobering reality. The teams weren’t about to play for a tie. But they both knew that a tie would send them to the playoffs. It could plausibly and realistically change the decision making and lead the teams to play cautiously knowing that a tie was as good as a win for both of them. 
Las Vegas got the ball first, and after quarterback Derek Carr moved the Raiders down field, they had to settle for a field goal. That’s when Herbert, who finished the game completing 34-of-64 passes for 384 yards, pulled off even more magic. This time, on fourth-and-9, he connected with Mike Williams for 47 yards to pull the Chargers into field goal range. 
When it came to fourth-and-6, this time the Chargers didn’t go for it. They kicked. And it was good, knotting the game at 32-32 with just minutes to play and the next score ending the game. 
That meant the Raiders got the ball back with a curious dilemma. If they could somehow bleed the clock, everyone would leave happy. But they also faced the risk of the Chargers getting the ball back and scoring. 
As they got toward midfield, they seemed content running clock. When they faced third-and-4 from the Los Angeles 39-yard-line, there were just 38 seconds left. It was unclear if they’d bother attempting a long shot kick—or just watch the clock tick to 0:00. The television cameras, during overtime, panned to a steamed fan in Steelers gear inside the stadium. 
But on third-and-4, running back Josh Jacobs scampered for 10 yards. With two seconds left, the Raiders called timeout. They were within field goal range. Interim coach Rich Bisaccia, who took over for Jon Gruden, could have just taken the tie and the playoff berth. 
Instead, he sent out kicker Daniel Carlson. As the clock ticked to zeroes, the kick went through. There were no answers to everyone’s theoretical questions, such as: If a tie sends both teams to the playoffs, do both coaches get a Gatorade bath?  
The game capped a nutty Week 18, the first in league history after an extra game was added before this season. The Colts’ season ended in a complete collapse after their unfathomable loss to the Jaguars. And the Raiders-Chargers showdown was the third consequential overtime result of the day. The San Francisco 49ers stormed back to beat the Los Angeles Rams and earn a playoff berth in an extra period. The Steelers also needed overtime to beat the Ravens. 
All of that set the stage for Chargers-Raiders. Then, the last second of the NFL’s regular season turned out to be the most consequential second of the entire season. That’s because a game didn’t end in a tie. 






Daniel Carlson’s 47-yard field goal sent the Raiders into the postseason.

WASHINGTON—The Internal Revenue Service will begin accepting 2021 individual income-tax returns on Jan. 24, and administration officials are already warning of paperwork backlogs and difficulty reaching IRS employees on the telephone during this year’s filing season.
“In many areas, we are unable to deliver the amount of service and enforcement that our taxpayers and tax system deserves and needs. This is frustrating for taxpayers, for IRS employees and for me,” IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said in a statement. “IRS employees want to do more, and we will continue in 2022 to do everything possible with the resources available to us.”

The seven-day average of newly reported Covid-19 infections in the U.S. is on track to triple the pre-Omicron record set a year ago, when America saw a quarter million daily cases, as concerns grow over access to and reliability of testing both in the U.S. and Europe, where the highly transmissible Omicron variant has also taken root.
Growing demand for tests has led some laboratories to ration access, giving priority to people exhibiting symptoms or who have other underlying health concerns. The University of North Carolina’s microbiology lab, for instance, is restricting tests to those showing Covid-19 symptoms, employees and patients who need a test before undergoing surgery. The University of Washington temporarily closed some of its testing sites last week and is giving appointment priority to people with Covid-19 symptoms or a known exposure, amid growing demand, though health experts worry that asymptomatic people might continue to spread the virus if they are unable to access testing.

Crystal Jensen had finished a shower one morning in 2019 when she noticed movement out of the corner of her eye. “I didn’t have any clothes on,” Ms. Jensen says. “And there was a phone up to the window.” Her male neighbor, Tobie Munroe, was eventually charged with a felony peeping Tom offense.
It was dropped last year due to Ms. Jensen’s heritage. She has a small amount of Cherokee blood, and she lives within the historical boundaries of the Cherokee Nation. Under the Supreme Court’s wrongheaded 2020 McGirt ruling, the state can no longer prosecute such crimes in what’s now considered Indian country. The feds could perhaps bring a case, but they’re deluged. Ms. Jensen has heard “not a word” from them.

Sixteen major U.S. universities, including Yale University, Georgetown University and Northwestern University, are being sued for alleged antitrust violations because of the way they work together to determine financial-aid awards for students.
According to a lawsuit filed in Illinois federal court late Sunday by law firms representing five former students who attended some of the schools, the universities engaged in price fixing and unfairly limited aid by using a shared methodology to calculate applicants’ financial need. Schools are allowed under federal law to collaborate on their formulas, but only if they don’t consider applicants’ financial need in admissions decisions. The suit alleges these schools do weigh candidates’ ability to pay in certain circumstances, and therefore shouldn’t be eligible for the antitrust exemption.

As the world’s climate continues to warm, more than 50 nations have pledged to achieve “net-zero” greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury. That means producing radically lower levels of these gases in the decades ahead while removing from the atmosphere the equivalent of what we do produce. Coal-burning power plants are on their way out, and clean energy sources like solar and wind are growing rapidly. In the U.S., energy generation from renewable sources, including hydropower and geothermal power, surpassed coal in 2020 and is now second only to gas.
The notable exception in this low-carbon energy boom is nuclear power, which has been stalled for decades. Most reactors now operating were built in the 1970s, and many in the U.S. and Europe are being closed. Worldwide, 450 reactors generate 10% of the total electricity consumed today, down from more than 15% in 2005, thanks to a rapid global build-out of power capacity that has largely left nuclear behind.

KABUL—The Taliban have arrested a Kabul university professor who gained national fame for berating a senior official on live television, a sign of the intensifying crackdown on critics of Afghanistan’s new regime.
Faizullah Jalal, a professor of political science and law at Kabul University, was arrested Saturday, weeks after he confronted a Taliban official in a debate on Afghanistan’s largest television network, Tolo. Lashing out at the Taliban’s extremist rule, he called Mohammad Naeem, the spokesman for the Taliban’s political office in Doha, a “terrorist” and a “calf,” an Afghan insult for people of low intelligence.

Yes, gargantuan fixtures can add both intimacy and intrigue Mammoth modern light fixtures might evoke an alien invasion, but fans of oversize lanterns swear by their ability to soothe the puny humans below them. In the vacation home above, Mexico City designer Olga Hanono painted the walls and double-height ceiling of the living room white, à la a Greek Island getaway. But the space, grounded by an oat and white sectional, lacked intimacy. Mrs. Hanono hired local artisans to handcraft a sisal dome 90 inches in diameter that cocoons everyone beneath. “I firmly believe we all have, inside of us, an energy,” said Mrs. Hanono, “and this chandelier is like a container. Otherwise the room would be very open,” and, in her view, let that energy dissipate. When lit, the woven hemisphere casts shadows that exude a “fireplace coziness,” she said.

As the Covid pandemic enters its third year, it remains a factor to be reckoned with in the art world, as in the world at large. A source of creative inspiration as well as logistical challenges, the pandemic will continue to serve many artists as a springboard into new areas of exploration in 2022.
Rafael Lozano-Hemmer weathered an early bout of Covid himself, an experience that helped spark his exhibition “A Crack in the Hourglass, An Ongoing Covid-19 Memorial,” on view at the Brooklyn Museum through June 26 and also accessible online. The focus is a machine that uses a robotic arm and nozzle to create portraits in sand of people who died from Covid. In a nod to life’s transience and continuity, the machine then wipes away each completed image and reuses the sand for the next portrait. At the Brooklyn Museum, the gallery walls are lined with prints of more than 500 of these portraits, each a distinct likeness but soft and somewhat blurred, almost like a visual memory.

In recent years, Western foreign policy experts have focused on planning for a long-term cold war with China. As 2022 dawns, however, a more pressing crisis has come to the fore: the unexpected prospect of a hot war in Europe.
To all appearances, Russian troops are preparing to launch a major invasion of Ukraine. The conflict there since 2014 has already resulted in at least 10,000 deaths and 24,000 casualties. A full-scale Russian attack would meet fierce Ukrainian resistance and lead to significant bloodshed. Military advisers from the U.S. and other NATO states are currently stationed in Ukraine, and should they suffer casualties, the conflict could widen, with potentially devastating consequences.

Energy prices are soaring, and it’s likely a sign of things to come. The rise can be blamed on a variety of things, including the demand rebound after the lockdowns ended, a drop in renewable electricity output from a lack of wind in Europe during most of 2021, and increasingly costly climate policies. But while the pandemic will end and the wind will blow again, climate policies to achieve “net zero” emissions will keep hiking prices.
Barack Obama acknowledged in 2008 that electricity prices “would necessarily skyrocket” under his proposed climate policies. He was more candid than many of today’s politicians and advocates. Limiting the use of fossil fuels requires making them more expensive and pushing people toward green alternatives that remain pricier and less efficient.

TAIPEI—China has much to lose should violence in Kazakhstan grind on or dissolve into civil war. For now, though, Beijing is largely sitting on the sidelines as Moscow, an ideological ally with which it shares many goals in Central Asia, handles the trickier task of suppressing dissent in their oil-rich neighbor.
For the second time in six months, China is facing military turmoil on its western frontier. And, as when Afghanistan fell to the Taliban in August last year, Beijing is adopting a wait-and-see approach, eschewing a leading role in a complex and uncertain geopolitical landscape where it lacks experience.

When Howard Nathan first began working as an organ-transplant coordinator in Philadelphia in 1978, the process of shepherding kidneys from the recently departed to the sick but hopeful still seemed ghoulish to many. He recalls a party where he was asked what he did for a living: “I told them I have to talk to families whose loved ones just passed away and get them to donate the organs. They quickly said, ‘OK, nice talking to you.’”
Today, a procedure that once evoked Frankenstein has become familiar. Over 40,000 organ transplants took place in 2021, a record, and nearly 170 million Americans have chosen to register as potential organ donors, according to federal figures. The change is due in part to the work of Mr. Nathan, who is stepping down this month after 38 years as president and CEO of the Gift of Life Donor Program, the largest and most successful organ donor and transplant network in the country.

IT HAD BEEN a youthful year for men’s fashion. Cutesy charm necklaces often encircled the necks of Pete Davidson and Justin Bieber, making those shlumpy style icons—and paparazzi favorites—look like they’d been sprung from summer camp. Last November, Washington Wizard Kyle Kuzma pulled up to the locker room in a pink Raf Simons sweater with gigundo sleeves, calling to mind a kid wearing his big brother’s hand-me-downs. And fashion companies minted adult-size clothes with serious  Children’s Place  overtones. British label JW Anderson’s spring offering was littered with sweaters and other pieces in cutesy strawberry prints, while  Urban Outfitters  carries a “doodle” hoodie covered in infantilizing smiley faces. 
This adult embrace of dressing like a tweenager has a name: “kidcore.” While it’s been simmering for a while (the 2018 explosion of tie-dye was an early indicator), kidcore has soared during the pandemic. You might theorize that men found solace in dressing like their preteen selves: Lyst, a British company that tracks the behavior of more than 150 million online shoppers in 2021, ranked kidcore as one of its top trends of 2021, based largely on the strength of searches for things like charm necklaces and cartoony  Crocs .  “A lot of people were searching for comfort and familiarity,” said Pierre Lavenir, a cultural specialist at Lyst.

The beauty of nature is a reliable balm for whatever the rest of life has thrown at us. But humans have never been content just to look, and we’ve got a long history of seeking to copy and improve on nature, experimenting with artificial diamonds, realistic but plastic flowers, and imitation pearls. At this time of year, the scale of our bio-inspired construction goes into overdrive. Out in the ski resorts, millions of gallons of water are being blasted over the slopes to create artificial snowflakes. But the originals are some of the most stunning and fragile curios that nature has to offer, so perhaps imitation is a tall order. How do the results stack up?

Hundreds of millions of people have gotten the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc. Covid-19 vaccine shots. But how many know that the  Pfizer  vaccine is called Comirnaty? And Moderna’s? Spikevax. 
Despite a year of wall-to-wall media coverage and debate, the names of the world’s two biggest Covid-19 vaccines are nowhere close to the name recognition of such products as Tylenol, Kleenex or the iPhone.

MOSCOW—The flood of Russian troops into Kazakhstan to help shore up the embattled government sends a clear signal to both the West and other former Soviet republics: Russian President Vladimir Putin will brook no threat to what he views as Russia’s inviolable sphere of influence.
The venture into Kazakhstan, at the request of the country’s leader, follows nearly 15 years of Russian interventionism in Georgia, Belarus, Ukraine and elsewhere aimed at pulling these countries even closer to Russia, by propping up leaders aligned with the Kremlin, playing regional power-broker, or trying to weaken those who have shown deference to the West.

The pandemic made clear that most states weren’t prepared for an economic crisis. They hadn’t saved enough money to support those who were hardest hit or taken steps to drive a stronger recovery once the downturn ended. Nearly two years later, most of the trust funds that pay for state unemployment benefits are insolvent, while nearly four million Americans are still missing from the labor force. States should look to Florida, North Carolina and Alabama, which have solved both problems by linking unemployment benefits to economic conditions.
It’s called unemployment indexing, and while the details of each state’s reform differ in the specifics, they share some basic similarities. When the economy is strong and the unemployment rate is low, benefits end sooner. When the economy is struggling and unemployment is high, benefits last longer. This approach spurs work and saves money in good times, while more effectively supporting laid-off workers in the toughest times.

The seven-day average for newly reported cases in the U.S. topped 700,000 for the first time, data from Johns Hopkins University show, as the highly infectious Omicron variant spreads throughout the country.
The average of known cases could soon triple the pre-Omicron record set a year ago, when the U.S. briefly saw about a quarter million daily cases. The numbers reported by state health departments and collected by Johns Hopkins also likely reflect a fraction of the true number, due in part to Omicron’s rapid spread and the difficulty many Americans have had getting tested. Some laboratories are limiting test-processing to certain people such as those with symptoms because of the surge in demand.

Rarely has a European leader spelled out the continent’s Covid-19 strategy as bluntly as French President Emmanuel Macron, who said last week: “The unvaccinated, I really want to piss them off.” 
The question facing the European Union is whether progressively excluding vaccine holdouts from work places and leisure spaces will be enough in the face of the Omicron variant to prevent a crisis in hospitals and avoid further lockdowns. France, Germany, Italy and many other EU countries are pressuring unvaccinated adults to get inoculated by excluding them from more everyday activities, while stopping short of a universal vaccine mandate. European arm-twisting contrasts with more laissez-faire approaches in the U.K. and U.S., but doesn’t satisfy public-health experts who say it would be more effective to make vaccination mandatory.

At 7.3%, the eurozone’s unemployment rate was below pre-pandemic levels in October, having hit a pandemic high of 8.6% in September 2020. The relatively small size of those swings, economists say, is largely because of furlough programs, in which governments essentially paid businesses to keep idled workers on as employees during the pandemic, rather than letting them go, by covering a large share of their wages.

When Hurricane Sandy made landfall near New York City almost a decade ago, bringing huge storm surges and 7 inches of rain that caused widespread flooding and blackouts, the superstorm was seen as an exceedingly rare event. Though common in regions closer to the equator, including the Caribbean and along the Gulf Coast, such storms rarely make direct strikes on the northeastern U.S.
But a new study suggests that as the planet warms, the storms will become more common in mid-latitude regions—between 30 and 60 degrees latitude in both hemispheres—that include New York City and Boston as well as Beijing, Tokyo and other large cities in eastern Asia and Australia.

Escalating demand for Covid-19 tests is prompting some laboratories to ration access, giving priority to people with symptoms or other health concerns as the Omicron variant quickly spreads.
Triaging who is eligible for Covid-19 tests can help ensure that patients who need a test the most get results fast enough to isolate or get treatment, pathologists and public-health experts say. The strategy, however, risks perpetuating the virus’s spread if some people get turned away from testing altogether.

I was not as impressed as others by the president’s speech Thursday in the Capitol. I wanted him to take on a kind of broad-gauged gravity that spoke of the attack of 1/6/21 in a way that didn’t make Trump supporters and many Republicans lean away from the first moments but start to lean forward, however reluctantly, even painfully, knowing that what they were hearing was wisdom.
A lot of people have a lot of admitting to do, most spectacularly Republican lawmakers on the Hill, but you’re not likely to win admission by a great public damning, and asserting in the most heightened language, on an anniversary. Wisdom, and a kind of high modesty that doesn’t seek to win the moment, was what was needed.

The delay in the rollout of 5G is only the latest of several factors making companies cautious on deploying the next-generation wireless service in their operations, analysts and industry executives say.
On Monday,

      and










            Verizon Communications Inc.
agreed to postpone their 5G rollouts until Jan. 19 to give the Federal Aviation Administration more time to assess whether the new wireless signals interfere with flight control systems.
 But even beyond the two-week delay, there is no dearth of reasons that companies are being careful on 5G. The cost and complexity of bringing out new infrastructure are holding back some, as well as the less-than-ringing demand, analysts say.

Fifth-generation wireless service will provide faster connections to mobile-phone users, and opportunities for businesses to connect a much greater number of sensors and other devices to faster networks across industries, from manufacturing and logistics to retail and agriculture, analysts say. 5G systems also make it easier and quicker for companies to configure wireless services on their own, according to analysts.

“It’s the key to smart factories, smart cities, the transformation of healthcare, and offers all communities greater access to technology,” Mr. Roese said.
Any big update of the cellular networks is a time-consuming process, said









      
      Bill Menezes,



      a director at Gartner Inc. “There is a lengthy time frame between making the described airwaves available at auction, conducting the auctions, then actually deploying the infrastructure to support these airwaves,” he said. What’s more, apps that might generate demand and drive 5G adoption are still in relatively early stages of development.
Still, interagency spats could result in greater uncertainty on spectrum usage rights, which could slow investment in 5G across the board, said

      director of broadband and spectrum policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank.

But so far 5G network deployment is running ahead of application deployment. “I can’t point to any companies that have big product launches ready to go that will be delayed,” he said.
Deutsche Post DHL Group sees many potential benefits for the supply chain from next-generation wireless technology, a spokesperson said—but added that the company has no “big splash” 5G projects in the pipeline. DHL plans to take advantage of 5G for robotics, scanners and tracking technology, along with smaller rollouts at individual warehouses, distribution centers and campuses, he said.

“Very few companies are using 5G today, and no one has identified any mission-critical applications yet,” said

The past two years of remote work reveal that for chief information officers, architects of enterprisewide technology transformation, few tools are as important as a decent computer and phone. CIO Journal asked IT executives to describe their favorite work-from-home gadgets.
 Dave Williams, chief information and digital officer at pharmaceutical maker

      & Co., and









      
      Francesco Tinto,



      CIO at drugstore chain










        Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.,


      both nominated laptops as their go-to tech tools. “I’m not a big gadget guy,” admitted Mr. Tinto.
Anil Bhatt, CIO of health insurer Anthem Inc. and Ramon Richards, CIO at mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae, cited their










        Apple Inc.


      iPhones as their favorite work-from-home gadgets. Mr. Richards also praised his Apple Watch. “It’s really all just been about staying connected. In a strange way, connectivity feels a lot higher working from home,” he said.
“Many of us didn’t anticipate we would be spending so much more time in front of our computer,” said Shadman Zafar, CIO of global consumer bank at Citigroup Inc. He makes the most of that time with an under-the-table elliptical machine. “This gadget helped me stay active throughout the day even when I’m sitting at my desk,” he said. Also helping matters, the Herman Miller chair Mr. Zafar cited as his other favorite gadget.

      listed his digital exercise system, Tonal, as his favorite gadget. “It allows me to have high energy when I work as the exercise keeps my well-being balanced,” he said.

“I couldn’t imagine living without Zoom,” said Brian Rice, CIO at Cardinal Health Inc. Several CIOs listed peripherals that cater to videoconferencing as their favorite gadgets.

      swore by a good headset. “There’s a lot of noise and distractions in your house and your world,” he said, “This allows you to be very kind of laser focused, and I think be much better and engaged.”
Jack McCarthy, CIO at the State of New Jersey Judiciary, spoke highly of his noise-canceling headphones. “The ability to listen to a conference, conference call, or even just music without interrupting everyone else in the house is paramount to work-from-home success,” he said.

      president, operations & technology, at payments company










        Mastercard Inc.,


      cobbled together a lighting solution. His favorite gadget is a table lamp covered by a face mask.
“Early in the pandemic lockdown, when everything suddenly shifted to Zoom and Teams, I found that my room lighting was terrible for video,” he said. “Taking inspiration from broadcast, I grabbed what I had available (some spare desk lamps and white surgical masks) and mocked up studio lighting diffusers.”
For Edward Wagoner, CIO at commercial real-estate company

      happiness is an Uplift standing desk. “I cannot believe I ever lived without my Uplift standing desk,” he said. “Lower back pain from sitting for hours has virtually disappeared.”

I’VE SPENT the last 15 winters, on and off, flitting around the world’s great ski towns, from the Swiss Alps to the Colorado Rockies to the Chilean Andes. With this winter’s flurries of Covid travel restrictions and surging lift prices across the U.S., I stayed in my native Canada this season. And I realized that the covetable combination of first-rate skiing, fabulous scenery and small-town coziness that I’d sought in ski spots around the world exists in my own backyard, and for much friendlier prices. 
For my first trip of the season in mid-December, I set out for a place I’d never been: Canmore, Alberta. From Toronto, it’s about a four-hour flight to Calgary International Airport, the closest major hub. Cradled in the Rocky Mountains, Canmore is within a half-hour’s drive of Banff and less than an hour from Lake Louise. My cousin Kent, a ski pro who lives in Calgary, insists that Canmore, which is largely free of touristy kerfuffle, beats those more famous spots as a place to stay. The closest slopes, about a 35-minute drive, are at Banff Sunshine Village, with its 3,300 acres of skiable area, 3,500-foot drop, eight lifts, including an eight-person gondola and what the resort claims is Canada’s only heated chair lift. Sunshine Village averages about 30 feet of snow per season. My favorite selling point: At the Mad Trappers Saloon, a two-story bar built out of the mountain’s original 1928 log cabin, you can get a pre-run summit beer and a basket of pickle fries. One-day passes cost $105 a person, at least 35% less than what Aspen, Vail, Jackson Hole and Breckenridge are charging this month.

Thousands of rocket launchers, machine guns, sniper rifles and other weapons seized in the Arabian Sea by the U.S. Navy in recent months likely originated from a single port in Iran, according to a confidential United Nations report that provides some of the most detailed evidence that Tehran is exporting arms to Yemen and elsewhere.
The draft report prepared by a U.N. Security Council panel of experts on Yemen said small wooden boats and overland transport were used in attempts to smuggle weapons made in Russia, China and Iran along routes to Yemen that the U.S. has tried for years to shut down. The boats left from the Iranian port of Jask on the Sea of Oman, the U.N. report said, citing interviews with the boat’s Yemeni crews and data from navigational instruments found on board.

A chronic shortage of workers has more employers turning to artificial intelligence to supercharge recruiting efforts, seeking an edge in an increasingly pitched battle to fill job openings.
By automating previously manual tasks—like pre-screening job applicants for basic qualifications, checking for professional credentials and licenses, or scheduling follow-up interviews—employers hope to streamline the hiring process and scoop up available workers before competitors move in.
 Artificial-intelligence capabilities, like conversational AI software, can speed up the early back-and-forth emails, texts and other communications with applicants and quickly get strong candidates in front of recruiters. Other AI-enabled tools are being used to accelerate the employee onboarding process, getting new hires oriented, trained and set up with computers, business apps and corporate email accounts.

Trucking company










            U.S. Xpress Enterprises Inc.


      uses conversational AI software to handle most of the early stages of the hiring process, including text exchanges with job applicants, said Amanda Thompson, the Chattanooga, Tenn.-based business’s chief people officer. When job seekers submit an application via a mobile device, the AI tool automatically replies with a series of preliminary questions, she said.

Ms. Thompson said the supply-chain disruptions resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath have led to soaring demand for truckers and a dearth of available drivers. “It’s a highly competitive labor market,” she said.
“If drivers are sitting at a truck stop, or at home, and they’re ready to apply for a job, we want to make that as easy as possible,” she said.
The Labor Department on Friday said U.S. hiring slowed in December, with employers adding 199,000 new jobs, compared with average monthly job growth of 537,000 in 2021. Some economists said the slowdown reflects companies’ inability to find workers as labor supply remains tight.

          The American workforce is rapidly changing. In August, 4.3 million workers quit their jobs, part of what many are calling “the Great Resignation.” Here’s a look into where the workers are going and why. Photo illustration: Liz Ornitz/WSJ
        


Roughly 80% of 400 human resources and other corporate officials surveyed this year by information-technology trade group CompTIA said they expect AI to have a moderate to significant impact on HR and recruiting in the year ahead. Most companies are already piloting or actively using AI in candidate screening, onboarding, competency assessment and career planning, CompTIA said.
That demand is catching the attention of investors. Paradox Inc., a Scottsdale, Ariz.-based startup that developed the AI recruiting tools used by U.S. Xpress, last week announced a $200 million fundraising round that lifts its valuation to roughly $1.5 billion, Paradox said.
“People are looking at old systems and saying this isn’t going to get it done,” said









      
      Aaron Matos,



      the company’s chief executive. “What we take out is the waiting,” Mr. Matos said.
Saleem Khaja, co-founder and chief operating officer at WorkLLama, an online platform that uses a conversational AI bot to connect job seekers with employers, said shifting workforce demographics mean that talent is more comfortable with—and often prefers—engaging with employers via messaging apps rather than getting on a call.
U.S. Xpress, which operates a fleet of more than 6,500 trucks and 13,000 trailers, said it had a 40% increase in the number of experienced hires in the fourth quarter compared with the same period in 2020. The company currently has more than 7,000 drivers, including full-time employees and independent contractors. Ms. Thompson said, Paradox’s AI platform has helped reduce the time it takes to get a new driver through the application process, and on the company payroll, from several weeks—or even months—to a week or so.
Jason Pyle, president of staffing firm Harvey Nash USA, said his company’s experience with AI recruiting tools has been mixed. The tools, he said, tend to miss crucial aspects of successfully placing job candidates, such as understanding an employer’s broader goals or offering a sense of company culture. “Our experience is these tools fall short in delivering start to finish,” Mr. Pyle said.
Some lawmakers, regulators and analysts have called for closer scrutiny of the use of AI software in assessing job candidates. They say hiring bias can result from unintentional racial or gender stereotypes buried in data sets and algorithms.
The New York City Council in November passed a bill requiring employers and staffing agencies to conduct a bias audit before using AI tools to screen job candidates.
Paradox says its platform only handles the administrative side of the process and does not make hiring decisions or suggestions.

When Laura and David Gunner learned their 27-year-old son, Steven, had died from an opioid overdose, the couple were stricken by grief but not entirely surprised. They had struggled to help him overcome addictions and erratic behavior for more than a decade.
Seeking solace in the aftermath of Steven’s 2020 death, the upstate New York couple joined the Donor Sibling Registry, a website that connects sperm and egg donors and donor-conceived people. They hoped to make contact with the mothers and fathers of other children who, like Steven, had been conceived with sperm from a particular donor sold by a sperm bank in Fairfax, Va.

With inflation at its highest rate since 1982, the topic seems to be on everyone’s minds, from policy makers to shoppers. The worry is especially acute as inflation appears to be rising still. 
Inflation tends to be understood as higher prices resulting either from increased costs—global supply-chain issues and hard-to-find workers—or from increased demand, such as pent-up purchases, as well as easy monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and blowout spending from Congress. But there’s another significant factor at play: Price increases also arise from growth in the perceived value of economic offerings.

Jeff Bezos, 57, is having fun with accessories, and his haters are having fun mocking them. In July 2021, the founder of Amazon.com Inc. and aerospace enterprise Blue Origin, flew to space while wearing a rather on-the-nose cowboy hat from upscale Aspen store Kemo Sabe. “I guess space turns you into Kenny Chesney,” joked Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show” then. Mr. Bezos’ girlfriend, journalist Lauren Sánchez, was photographed kissing him the day of the space flight while shielded by her own cowboy hat. Recently, the couple made headlines again by doing little more than posting a photo to Instagram of their outfits for a poolside disco-themed New Year’s Eve party.
But, oh, what a photo. In it, Mr. Bezos beams in a pair of tight white pants, a gaudy patterned silk shirt and heart-shaped sunglasses (at night), while Ms. Sánchez wears a racy sparkled jumpsuit with significant cutaways. They look like a couple that does little but work out and make out—the billionaire version of the cast of the reality show “Jersey Shore”—an impression reinforced by other photos taken of the pair during their 2021-2022 holiday break spent on a yacht with friends and family near St. Barth in the Caribbean. Through a representative, Mr. Bezos declined to comment.

The January effect is a theory in financial markets that has existed for 50-plus years. It states that stocks and other assets seem to go up the most in the first month of a year.

WASHINGTON—Republicans are testing out new lines of attack related to the new year’s school shutdowns, with party officials seeing Democrats’ record on Covid-19 education policy giving them an opening to build their war chests and sway voters in the midterms.
School closures and frustrations with remote learning played a significant role in Republicans’ victory last year in Virginia, when Glenn Youngkin won the governor’s mansion. Now, following a wave of temporary closures nationwide due to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, Republicans are targeting what they say is Democrats’ mismanagement of the outbreak.

SAN XOÁN DE RIO, Spain—The small building in a village near this town was once a school filled with children. Now it is a mortuary, a stark illustration of the demographic forces shaping Europe’s future.
It has been years since there were enough children to sustain a local school in many villages in this rural corner of Galicia, northwestern Spain, that have been hollowed out over decades by migration to cities and low birthrates. Other defunct schools have been left to crumble, or in some cases repurposed as social centers for the elderly, who now make up a majority of the population.

Small restaurants are heading back to Congress for help, saying their challenges are worsening as the Omicron variant drives a surge in Covid-19 cases across the country.
Nearly two years into the pandemic, U.S. restaurants and bars are dealing with higher costs, accumulating debts and customers fearful of the latest virus variants, according to a letter signed by more than 3,300 operators and sent to Washington lawmakers in December. The restaurant operators said they were in danger of closing permanently if a federal fund adopted last year to assist the food-service industry isn’t replenished soon.

The threat posed by the Omicron variant has now come into sharper focus, with recent clinical data and laboratory studies lending support to early reports suggesting that it is milder but more transmissible than other variants of the new coronavirus.

No longer did her group chats work seamlessly with other peers, almost all of whom used iPhones. FaceTime calls became more complicated and the University of Michigan sophomore’s phone didn’t show up in an app she used to find friends.

Hours after President Biden’s Sept. 9 speech announcing a series of vaccine mandates for private-sector employees, his chief of staff, Ron Klain, retweeted an MSNBC anchor’s quip that wielding workplace-safety regulation to force vaccinations was “the ultimate work-around.” Congress has never enacted a law requiring American civilians to be vaccinated—assuming it even has the constitutional authority to do so, which is doubtful. The Supreme Court hears arguments Friday on two of the mandates, which are likely to meet the same fate as other recent attempts to circumvent Congress that the courts have rejected.
The Constitution vests the power to make laws in Congress and charges the president with the duty to execute them. That’s what many in Washington derisively call the “high school civics class” model of government. It’s slow, it’s cumbersome, it rarely approves measures that don’t enjoy widespread public support, and it forces compromise, moderation and tailoring of policies to address the circumstances of a vast and varied nation. The temptation of avoiding it via executive fiat is obvious.

But for days following the start of an increasingly bloody confrontation this week that has pitted the authorities in Kazakhstan, a former Soviet republic in Central Asia, against protesters demanding political change, his conspicuous absence from the political stage was a central mystery.

Families are bracing for bank balances to suffer when the middle of January comes and the monthly child-tax-credit payment doesn’t. 
More than 30 million households started getting up to $300 per child in July after Congress temporarily transformed an annual tax break into a near-universal monthly benefit. The full expanded credit went to households with incomes up to $75,000 for individuals, $112,500 for many single parents and $150,000 for married couples.

Deliveroo


      PLC, a food-delivery company based in the U.K. and backed by










            Amazon.com Inc.,


      plans to open its own pizza parlor in London in an effort to better understand restaurateurs. 
The drawbacks to the delivery experience have become familiar: Helmet-clad drivers and cyclists form knots at restaurants as they wait to pick up orders, doors bang open and closed as they come and go, and kitchen staff scramble to keep up with parallel streams of orders from on-site diners and those at home.
 “We want to understand restaurants’ pain points with the aim of solving them, and to do this by having a deep understanding of restaurant owners’ mind-set,” a Deliveroo spokesperson said, adding that the company has no plans to build a restaurant business beyond one site in London’s Swiss Cottage neighborhood.
The restaurant will be called Pizza Paradiso, according to a licensing application filed to London’s Camden Council. According to floor plans seen by The Wall Street Journal, the site will comprise outdoor and indoor seating, a front-of-house pizza oven, a back-of-house kitchen and an interior waiting bench.

The idea is for Deliveroo staff to learn how to manage a restaurant that offers dine-in and delivery, working out how best to balance the needs of both types of diners at peak times, the company said.

Deliveroo has experience running food-service operations. The company in 2016 began opening Deliveroo Editions, locations known as “dark kitchens” or “ghost kitchens,” where multiple restaurant brands operate kitchens exclusively for delivery in one central space. It now operates nearly 300 such kitchens globally, in markets including the U.K., United Arab Emirates, France and Hong Kong.
But owning and operating a restaurant for eat-in customers is a novel concept for a technology business, said Trish Caddy, a senior food-service analyst at London-based market-research company Mintel Group Ltd. and a former restaurant chef and manager.
If Deliveroo uses its Swiss Cottage location to draw up a replicable operational blueprint for other eateries, it might be able to attract more restaurateurs into its network, she said.
“It could be people who say, ‘We’ve been running a mom-and-pop restaurant for forever, but we don’t know how to adapt to accommodate this new world of home delivery, takeout and click-and-collect,’ ” Ms. Caddy said.
Deliveroo’s move comes as San Francisco-based










            DoorDash Inc.


      is reinstating a program, suspended earlier in the pandemic, that asks every employee to carry out a delivery shift or shadow a customer-service agent once a month to better understand how their service works. 
Food-delivery companies can easily become disconnected from the restaurateurs and delivery people who power their platforms, said









      
      Nabeel Alamgir,



      who in 2019 founded Lunchbox Technologies Inc., a startup that allows restaurants to build ordering experiences on their own websites and apps. Earlier, Mr. Alamgir was chief marketing officer of Bareburger Group LLC after starting out as a busboy at the company’s first location.

“I can feel the distance, in losing touch with what is the challenge of being a restaurateur, just a tiny bit, and I’m just three years out,” he said. “So I’m always in the restaurants.”
Gaining more empathy for customers might help delivery companies find a competitive edge in a crowded sector that has struggled to find a path to profitability, Mr. Alamgir said. 
Deliveroo reported a pretax loss of £104.8 million for the first half of 2021, compared with a year-earlier loss of £128.4 million.
Shares in Deliveroo fell 26% on their first day of trading on the London Stock Exchange last March, as investors worried whether the company could maintain the momentum driven by high volumes of customer orders made during European pandemic lockdowns. Deliveroo shares closed at £1.97 on Friday, down 49% from their IPO price of £3.90.
Transactions processed on Deliveroo’s platform during the third quarter of 2021 rose 54% to £1.59 billion, equivalent to $2.17 billion, from £1.04 billion in the year-earlier quarter. 
The third quarter’s results marked a decline from the second quarter, when transactions totaled £1.74 billion. Deliveroo said the drop was typical for the season, but told investors the third quarter also brought particular challenges for its restaurant partners in many markets, as they contended with a full return of dine-in customers alongside sustained high demand for delivery, as well as supply-chain issues and labor shortages.

Hours after President Biden’s Sept. 9 speech announcing a series of vaccine mandates for private-sector employees, his chief of staff, Ron Klain, retweeted an MSNBC anchor’s quip that wielding workplace-safety regulation to force vaccinations was “the ultimate work-around.” Congress has never enacted a law requiring American civilians to be vaccinated—assuming it even has the constitutional authority to do so, which is doubtful. The Supreme Court hears arguments Friday on two of the mandates, which are likely to meet the same fate as other recent attempts to circumvent Congress that the courts have rejected.
The Constitution vests the power to make laws in Congress and charges the president with the duty to execute them. That’s what many in Washington derisively call the “high school civics class” model of government. It’s slow, it’s cumbersome, it rarely approves measures that don’t enjoy widespread public support, and it forces compromise, moderation and tailoring of policies to address the circumstances of a vast and varied nation. The temptation of avoiding it via executive fiat is obvious.

We’ve heard a lot about how school closings affect children, but what about parents left scrambling for child care and in-person learning options? In 2020, such disruptions disproportionately caused women to leave the labor market to take care of their children at home.
Using Census Bureau survey data, we found that pandemic-induced remote instruction made several mental-health outcomes worse for parents of school-age children. A 10-percentage-point increase in the share of public school districts going fully remote in a state was associated with about a 1-point increase in the proportion of parents reporting feelings of anxiety most days in the previous week. The same increase in remote instruction was associated with a 0.73-point increase in the proportion being worried, a 0.61-point increase in being depressed, and a 0.55-point increase in losing interest in daily activities.

Most of us in our 20s and 30s are familiar with the rhythms of friend-group life changes. First, people find their long-term relationships, and in each case you hear all the dish about who this new person is, and you vet them to make sure they’re a fit match for your beloved friend. Then, the couple moves in together, so you help assemble new furniture and attend the housewarming party. After that, maybe there’s a wedding—or, in the past couple of years, a Zoom ceremony—and you clink Champagne and make teary-eyed toasts. 
Everyone knows what comes next: Wait a couple of years, and your calendar will start filling up with invitations to baby showers and sip and sees, and you find yourself shopping for teensy shoes and picture books and other gifts appropriate for new parents.

I’VE SPENT the last 15 winters, on and off, flitting around the world’s great ski towns, from the Swiss Alps to the Colorado Rockies to the Chilean Andes. With this winter’s flurries of Covid travel restrictions and surging lift prices across the U.S., I stayed in my native Canada this season. And I realized that the covetable combination of first-rate skiing, fabulous scenery and small-town coziness that I’d sought in ski spots around the world exists in my own backyard, and for much friendlier prices. 
For my first trip of the season in mid-December, I set out for a place I’d never been: Canmore, Alberta. From Toronto, it’s about a four-hour flight to Calgary International Airport, the closest major hub. Cradled in the Rocky Mountains, Canmore is within a half-hour’s drive of Banff and less than an hour from Lake Louise. My cousin Kent, a ski pro who lives in Calgary, insists that Canmore, which is largely free of touristy kerfuffle, beats those more famous spots as a place to stay. The closest slopes, about a 35-minute drive, are at Banff Sunshine Village, with its 3,300 acres of skiable area, 3,500-foot drop, eight lifts, including an eight-person gondola and what the resort claims is Canada’s only heated chair lift. Sunshine Village averages about 30 feet of snow per season. My favorite selling point: At the Mad Trappers Saloon, a two-story bar built out of the mountain’s original 1928 log cabin, you can get a pre-run summit beer and a basket of pickle fries. One-day passes cost $105 a person, at least 35% less than what Aspen, Vail, Jackson Hole and Breckenridge are charging this month.

The Indianapolis Colts and the Jacksonville Jaguars play on Sunday afternoon. The Las Vegas Raiders and the Los Angeles Chargers play on Sunday night. Either the Raiders or Chargers would make the playoffs by winning. But if the Jaguars beat the Colts, both the Chargers and Raiders would advance in the event of a tie. It raises the outlandish possibility that both teams could spend the game kneeling, punting or spiking the football with designs of a 0-0 tie.

SYDNEY—Australia has already used satellite technology, helicopters with infrared cameras, and firetrucks with mobile data terminals to battle deadly wildfires. Next up are the goats.
The idea is to send out the four-legged laborers to munch through brush and leaf litter that can act as tinder during hot, dry years. In late October, around 40 of the animals were dispatched for a trial at an unused railway corridor across from Lue Public School. The workers, being animals, didn’t always stay focused on the job at hand.

Select committees come and go, with varying impact. The growing risk of Nancy Pelosi’s January 6 Committee is that it will be remembered for all the wrong reasons.
A year after the riot, it’s a fair time to evaluate what that committee has and hasn’t accomplished since its summer creation. By its charter, the committee is assigned with investigating “the facts, circumstances and causes” of the event, as well as those “relating to the preparedness and response of the United States Capitol Police” and other law-enforcement agencies. The country would hugely benefit from a straightforward accounting of that day.

We all got an earful about the “Great Resignation” in 2021, as Americans left their jobs in growing numbers. This past week, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. set a new quitting record in November. According to a PwC study last year, a full 65% of employees were in search of a new job. That’s great for employees who may feel newly empowered to start an entrepreneurial venture or use the tight job market to negotiate a raise or promotion. But what if you’re the boss? 
For obvious reasons, it’s problematic when your employees start leaving, or hinting or threatening that they might. Staff turnover is pricey—it costs an estimated one-half to two times an employee’s annual salary to replace her. Plus, it’s disruptive to client relationships and the morale of staffers left behind.

Rising construction costs will push the price tag for rebuilding after Colorado’s most destructive wildfire beyond the insurance coverage of some homeowners, according to construction, insurance-industry and government officials.
Losses are expected to reach $1 billion in last week’s Marshall Fire, which swept through the suburbs between Denver and Boulder, Colo. Rebuilding the roughly 1,000 homes destroyed and repairing damage to hundreds of others will strain already stretched builders and supply chains.

Donald Trump did the country—and himself—a favor by canceling the press conference he had planned for Jan. 6. But the press statement he released instead on Thursday underscores that the former President will never admit that he lost the 2020 election, no matter the cost to the country or his supporters.
Mr. Trump’s statement throws out a farrago of “questions” about the election intended to imply massive fraud that he could never prove in court, in Congress or in subsequent state audits. He asks how Mr. Biden could lose “27 out of 27 ‘toss up’ House races, but somehow miraculously receive the most votes in American history with no coattails?”

Doctors say Omicron is making fewer people seriously sick and the severe respiratory problems that were hallmarks of earlier waves of Covid-19 aren’t so prevalent this time around. The change reflects differences in how the variant attacks the body, booster shots shielding the most vulnerable against the severest aspects of the disease, and better treatments that forestall Covid-19’s progression.

Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said he had ordered the police and army to shoot without warning and signaled a broader crackdown against opponents as his security forces, backed by Russian troops, moved to restore control after days of unrest triggered by a fuel-price increase.
He said his government had largely restored order and told a meeting of security chiefs Friday that what he called a counterterrorism operation would continue “until the full liquidation of the militants,” who he said were still using weapons. “Law enforcement agencies and the army were given an order by me to shoot at terrorists to kill without warning,” he said, following the arrival of Russian troops to support his government.

WALK INTO MOST any wine shop and you’ll likely see signs touting a “hidden gem” or a “staff pick” or perhaps even an “unsung hero” or two. If you’re wondering what these terms really mean, you’re not alone.
Is a staff pick a wine a staffer actually loves or one the wine merchant needs to move? Similarly, is a hidden gem truly special but little known, or simply a bottle that has sat on the shelf a little too long? I recently queried retailers about why they attach certain phrases to certain bottles. In the process I found some wines that truly lived up to their buzzwords.

IT HAD BEEN a youthful year for men’s fashion. Cutesy charm necklaces often encircled the necks of Pete Davidson and Justin Bieber, making those shlumpy style icons—and paparazzi favorites—look like they’d been sprung from summer camp. Last November, Washington Wizard Kyle Kuzma pulled up to the locker room in a pink Raf Simons sweater with gigundo sleeves, calling to mind a kid wearing his big brother’s hand-me-downs. And fashion companies minted adult-size clothes with serious  Children’s Place  overtones. British label JW Anderson’s spring offering was littered with sweaters and other pieces in cutesy strawberry prints, while  Urban Outfitters  carries a “doodle” hoodie covered in infantilizing smiley faces. 
This adult embrace of dressing like a tweenager has a name: “kidcore.” While it’s been simmering for a while (the 2018 explosion of tie-dye was an early indicator), kidcore has soared during the pandemic. You might theorize that men found solace in dressing like their preteen selves: Lyst, a British company that tracks the behavior of more than 150 million online shoppers in 2021, ranked kidcore as one of its top trends of 2021, based largely on the strength of searches for things like charm necklaces and cartoony  Crocs .  “A lot of people were searching for comfort and familiarity,” said Pierre Lavenir, a cultural specialist at Lyst.

Energy prices are soaring, and it’s likely a sign of things to come. The rise can be blamed on a variety of things, including the demand rebound after the lockdowns ended, a drop in renewable electricity output from a lack of wind in Europe during most of 2021, and increasingly costly climate policies. But while the pandemic will end and the wind will blow again, climate policies to achieve “net zero” emissions will keep hiking prices.
Barack Obama acknowledged in 2008 that electricity prices “would necessarily skyrocket” under his proposed climate policies. He was more candid than many of today’s politicians and advocates. Limiting the use of fossil fuels requires making them more expensive and pushing people toward green alternatives that remain pricier and less efficient.

When I talk with senior executives about the ongoing pandemic, I often hear them wistfully yearn for a “return to work.” This choice of words is significant because it highlights how much we associate work with a workplace.
But the pandemic has taught us that many forms of work, especially high-end knowledge work, can be done effectively (or even more effectively) away from the workplace. When confronted with this fact, most executives say that coming to an office at least a few days a week is essential for fostering personal relationships, developing and integrating new employees, generating ideas and building company culture.

By all measures, 2021 was a banner year for the country’s luxury residential market, despite the economic uncertainty caused by the continuing global pandemic.
At least 40 properties in the United States sold for $50 million or more last year, a 35% increase from 2020, and at least eight sold for at least $100 million, a 300% jump from the prior year, according to data compiled by appraisal firm Miller Samuel and The Wall Street Journal. Real-estate experts attributed the increase in activity to low interest rates, as well as a surge in wealth created through gains in the stock market and alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. While deals in the ultraluxury sector don’t always speak to a broader surge in real-estate values, in 2021 they did coincide with a general uptick in the overall housing market. As of November 2021, existing-home sales were on track for their strongest year since 2006, thanks to low mortgage-interest rates and a robust job market, The Wall Street Journal reported.

For years, the annual tech-industry pilgrimage to Las Vegas known as CES has taken place in the first week of January, when industry execs, tech innovators and reporters the world over have barely recovered from holiday revelry.
 
This year, back in person after a completely virtual show in 2021, attendees are balancing their trade-show agendas with Covid-19 prevention measures and Omicron-related risk budgeting.
 
The host of CES, the Consumer Technology Association, implemented a vaccine requirement. Everyone picking up a badge must show proof.
 
In return, they receive a  complimentary Abbott self-test kit, which they are encouraged—but not required—to use.
 
Despite safety precautions, many frequent attendees, including some of the biggest Silicon Valley names and most of the tech media, have decided to stay home.
 
But more than 2,200 businesses, from startups to consumer-electronics giants such as Panasonic and Sony, RSVP'd yes.
 
Masks are required, and are handed out to anyone who needs one, and the usually crowded aisles between trade-show booths are wider, to encourage social distancing.
 
With at most 75,000 people expected, about half of past peak attendance, the show felt less crowded than usual.
 
Although many exhibitors held no-contact displays, some businesses demonstrated tech in person with visitors.
 
Health-care technology had been becoming a bigger part of the show, but the pandemic put it front and center. Here, Formlabs showed its 3D-printed nasal swabs for Covid testing.
 
CES has increasingly been a place where non-tech exhibitors show off their innovations as well. The U.S. Postal Service brought its model for a next-generation delivery vehicle.
 
With people spending more on their cats and dogs in the pandemic, smart devices like this pet health-and-location tracker from French company Invoxia are now more common on the show floor.
 
The people who made it to Las Vegas—not to mention everyone who stayed home—are already looking forward to a bigger and brighter CES 2023.

The pandemic made clear that most states weren’t prepared for an economic crisis. They hadn’t saved enough money to support those who were hardest hit or taken steps to drive a stronger recovery once the downturn ended. Nearly two years later, most of the trust funds that pay for state unemployment benefits are insolvent, while nearly four million Americans are still missing from the labor force. States should look to Florida, North Carolina and Alabama, which have solved both problems by linking unemployment benefits to economic conditions.
It’s called unemployment indexing, and while the details of each state’s reform differ in the specifics, they share some basic similarities. When the economy is strong and the unemployment rate is low, benefits end sooner. When the economy is struggling and unemployment is high, benefits last longer. This approach spurs work and saves money in good times, while more effectively supporting laid-off workers in the toughest times.

Initially sparked by a sharp increase in fuel prices at the beginning of year, the protests quickly spiraled into a broader outpouring of frustration with the resource-rich nation’s authoritarian leaders. Protesters accuse them of squandering its wealth, including its uranium reserves, echoing the kind of uprisings that toppled one of Mr. Putin’s protégés in Ukraine in 2014 and a wave of protests against Belarus’s pro-Kremlin leader in 2020.

A Consolidation Wave Reshapes Tech, Media and Telecom
The companies transforming the world are pursuing deals to evolve and stay competitive. 
 


The digitization of everything continues to reshape the world, driving continued evolution in how companies are run and the ways people work, play and consume media. At the center of these sweeping changes is the technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) sector.
Companies in the sector have engaged in a tsunami of mergers and acquisitions as they adapt to new demands, innovations and competitive pressures. The deals are taking place in all sectors and for businesses of all sizes, as some midsize companies merge with competitors to gain scale, while larger companies acquire disruptors rather than build from scratch.
In recent months, enterprises ranging from chipmakers to broadband providers have committed billions to building out new capacity and snapping up competitors to consolidate their leadership positions. In total, there were more than 2,000 TMT transactions equaling more than $240 billion just in the third quarter of 2021, bringing the year-to-date total to nearly 6,000 deals worth $1.9 trillion, according to KPMG.
Each deal puts new pressure on the rest of the field, leading to more consolidation and acquisitions.
“You have several trends driving M&A activity, including digitization, the migration of data to the cloud and a push for vertical integration. When one company makes changes, it can be a competitive threat to others in the space,” says Kevin Khanna, head of corporate banking at Fifth Third Bank. “In response, they’re going to consolidate, seek capital to expand into growth areas and chase disruption.”
There are a number of catalysts for deal activity across all sectors and for companies of all sizes. In some cases, it is faster and more cost-effective for a large company to buy an industry disruptor than to build the expertise internally. Likewise, consolidating middle market industry rivals could be the best approach to challenge a market leader.
Forces for Change
TMT companies are in the midst of a years-long push to digitize and automate much of their business processes, unlocking efficiencies and opening paths to new growth, says Bob Marcus, head of capital markets for Fifth Third Bank. “The drive toward digitization has been underway for some time, but the pandemic really accelerated those trends. Companies and private equity firms are looking to acquire and integrate new technology.”

When one company makes changes, it can be a competitive threat to others in the space,” says Kevin Khanna, head of corporate banking at Fifth Third Bank. “In response, they’re going to consolidate, seek capital to expand into growth areas and chase disruption.”
There are a number of catalysts for deal activity across all sectors and for companies of all sizes. In some cases, it is faster and more cost-effective for a large company to buy an industry disruptor than to build the expertise internally. Likewise, consolidating middle market industry rivals could be the best approach to challenge a market leader.
Forces for Change
TMT companies are in the midst of a years-long push to digitize and automate much of their business processes, unlocking efficiencies and opening paths to new growth, says Bob Marcus, head of capital markets for Fifth Third Bank. “The drive toward digitization has been underway for some time, but the pandemic really accelerated those trends. Companies and private equity firms are looking to acquire and integrate new technology.”

To be sure, there are different motivations and strategies within the broad TMT space. Technology companies have been focused on vertical integration, acquiring promising technologies to fold into their business and expand their share of wallet. Media organizations meanwhile are dealing with secular changes in how content is distributed. To bolster profitability, these businesses are seeking greater scale through acquisitions.
In the telecom space, companies are seeing dramatic growth in demand. That’s compelled them to seek capital they can use to build out infrastructure to support these activities, from the rollout of 5G and new data centers to faster fiber-optic networks.
All of these trends are putting pressure on companies to make investments, and that is driving them to pursue deals and new capital. “Larger companies have made it through this unprecedented period and not just survived, but thrived,” says Khanna. “Many of these companies feel emboldened to make major changes.”
On the other side of the equation, there is a considerable amount of money on the sidelines with investors who are eager to take part in the dramatic changes in the sector. In fact, private equity firms went into 2021 with nearly $2 trillion of uninvested capital to deploy, according to a recent Fifth Third industry report.
Putting Capital to Work
Marcus says private equity is helping many companies achieve their growth goals. The bank recently worked with a private equity firm that invested in a regional U.S. telecom that had been family-owned for generations and possessed valuable but underutilized assets. While it had great potential for expansion, the company needed additional capital to retool the business and take advantage of growth opportunities.
After the private equity firm completed its investment, the telecom’s management team was able to accelerate capital deployment and hire additional talent, which has resulted in enhanced revenues and margins. The company has also completed several “tuck-in” acquisitions to expand its footprint. Fifth Third says it can guide companies through this process with its expertise and experience.

“This is a phenomenon we have seen time and again, where we help companies access capital and they are able to create competitive advantages to unlock growth,” says Kevin Lavender, head of commercial banking at Fifth Third Bank.
Even public companies that can access a variety of funding options face challenges. An advisor like Fifth Third can offer financial expertise to weigh the costs and benefits of issuing equity, using cash reserves or funding a deal through debt.
Looking ahead, many TMT companies will continue to seek capital, for which they must navigate a crowded marketplace of investors competing to put their capital to work. Put together, the ongoing demand plus steady supply suggests this wave of M&A activity will not slow anytime soon.
“We will continue to see consolidation and acquisitions,” Khanna says. “There are a lot of investors that realize there is good money to be made, while the trends driving companies to seek capital have a long way to go.”

In the aftermath of Antonio Brown’s surreal exit from the field during his team’s game on Sunday, the star wide receiver has accused the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of pressuring him to play through a serious ankle injury while attempting to cover-up their knowledge of the issue. 
Brown’s explosive allegations Wednesday night came three days after he ran off the field shirtless—after stripping off his pads and jersey—in the third quarter of his team’s game against the New York Jets. The incident prompted Tampa Bay coach Bruce Arians to say after the game that Brown was “no longer a Buc.”

With inflation at its highest rate since 1982, the topic seems to be on everyone’s minds, from policy makers to shoppers. The worry is especially acute as inflation appears to be rising still. 
Inflation tends to be understood as higher prices resulting either from increased costs—global supply-chain issues and hard-to-find workers—or from increased demand, such as pent-up purchases, as well as easy monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and blowout spending from Congress. But there’s another significant factor at play: Price increases also arise from growth in the perceived value of economic offerings.

Netflix started ranking titles by total number of hours viewed in November to provide more clarity on the streaming service’s most popular content. It publishes global top 10 lists of most-watched TV and films, with data going back to last summer. 
The company previously gauged viewership by the number of subscribers who watch at least two minutes of an offering. The change came as a response to critics who felt that Netflix wasn’t being transparent enough with investors, consumers and its own producers regarding viewership information.

We’re in an acrimonious period of partisan tribalism and have been for some time. Both parties are guilty of overwrought denunciations of their political opponents. My criticisms are often aimed at Democrats; on the anniversary of Jan. 6, I’m addressing squarely those Republicans who for a year have excused the actions of the rioters who stormed the Capitol, disrupted Congress as it received the Electoral College’s results, and violently attempted to overturn the election.
 These apologists say those who stormed the Capitol were innocent patriots, tourists visiting the seat of the national government to petition their elected representatives peacefully. We’re told that these harmless, ordinary Americans are being persecuted as political prisoners.


Your browser does not support the audio tag.Opinion: Potomac WatchWhat's Missing From Congress's Jan. 6 AgendaLawmakers are planning to mark the anniversary of the Capitol riot, and former President Donald Trump canceled his own press conference. But Democrats want to use Jan. 6 as an excuse to overrule the Senate's filibuster to pass H.R.1, a federal takeover of elections. Why not instead focus on the riot's real causes, including the poorly designed Electoral Count Act? Meantime, what are Rep. Liz Cheney and the rest of the House Jan. 6 committee hoping to find?

Let’s stipulate that while the thousands who went to the Capitol a year ago were wrong to insist the election was stolen, most weren’t violent as they exercised their First Amendment rights to gather peacefully on the Mall—just as I had seen liberals gather to protest both inaugurations of President









      
      George W. Bush.



      
But last year there were several thousand protesters willing to use force to disrupt Congress in its constitutional duty to receive and certify the electoral vote. Some went to Washington with that purpose in mind. Others were swept up in the moment’s savagery, led astray by stronger wills with dangerous motives.

The leaders of this group were intent on committing violence, some having planned to do so for weeks. Many wore tactical gear. Some came armed with chemical agents, flagpoles, batons and sticks. They broke through barricades and assaulted approximately 140 police officers, in some cases with an officer’s own shield or gear. They smashed doors and windows, illegally entered the Capitol, ransacked offices and searched for leaders of Congress, and made dire threats about what would happen if they found them. 
More than 725 people have been charged so far, and law enforcement is searching for hundreds more suspects who appear on video or social media, some recorded attacking police officers. At least 163 people have pleaded guilty, and 71 have been sentenced. Only one defendant’s charges have been dismissed. Many of the most serious trials have yet to be held, as lawyers prepare defenses or negotiate plea deals. 
So, on this anniversary, here’s a simple thought experiment: What if the other side had done it? What if in early January 2017, Democrats similarly attired and armed had stormed the Capitol and attempted to keep Congress from receiving the Electoral College results for the 2016 presidential election? 
What if Democrats claimed that Donald Trump’s razor-thin victories in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin resulted from extensive voter fraud and should be rejected, despite having failed to establish in a single court that extensive fraud had actually occurred? 
What if some of these Democrats breached the Capitol defenses and threatened violence against the Republican speaker,









      
      Paul Ryan,



      and Republican Senate majority leader,









      
      Mitch McConnell



      ? 
What if they insisted that in his role as Senate president then-Vice President









      Joe Biden
      



      had sole authority to seat









      
      Hillary Clinton’s



      electors from any contested states and thereby hand her the presidency? 
If this happened, would some of my fellow Republicans have accepted it as merely a protest? Would they have called patriots those charged with violent acts against our country, its laws and Constitution? Would they have accepted such extralegal means to change the outcome of a presidential election? 
No they would not. I’m certain of that.
If Democrats had done what some Trump supporters did on that violent Jan. 6, Republicans would have criticized them mercilessly and been right to do so. Republicans would have torched any high official who encouraged violence or stood mute while it was waged and been right to do so. Republicans would have demanded an investigation to find who was responsible for the violence and been right to do so. 
To move beyond Jan. 6, 2021, we must put country ahead of party. For Democrats, that means resisting their leadership’s petty habit of aggravating partisan fault lines by indiscriminately condemning all who came to Washington that day.
We Republicans have a heavier burden. I’ve been a Republican my entire life, and believe in what the Republican Party, at its best, has represented for decades. There can be no soft-pedaling what happened and no absolution for those who planned, encouraged and aided the attempt to overthrow our democracy. Love of country demands nothing less. That’s true patriotism.

WASHINGTON—President Biden assailed former President Donald Trump and a mob of his supporters for the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, using the first anniversary of the attack to rebuke his predecessor’s attempts to undermine the 2020 election results.
The president accused Mr. Trump of spreading a “web of lies about the 2020 election,” pointing to his false claims of election fraud and his attempt to block the certification of Mr. Biden’s victory by Congress that day. Speaking in the Capitol’s Statuary Hall, he characterized last year’s events as a fundamental threat to the nation’s democracy and orderly transfer of power.

WASHINGTON—As Covid-19 cases climb across the U.S., President Biden and his administration are preparing Americans to accept the virus as a part of daily life, in a break from a year ago when he took office with a pledge to rein in the pandemic and months later said the nation was “closer than ever to declaring our independence from a deadly virus.”
The recalibration of Mr. Biden’s message comes as the country braces for another round of disruptions wrought by the pandemic. A growing number of schools temporarily have returned to virtual instruction and many businesses are strained by staffing shortages, in both cases due to infections triggered by the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Thursday marked the 12th straight day of more than 1,000 flight cancellations, and many states warned that ongoing testing shortages will make it harder to return people to work and school.

MOSCOW—Russia sent paratroopers to help Kazakhstan’s leader stamp out a wave of protests as, further west, Russian President Vladimir Putin confronts the U.S. and its allies over the future of another former Soviet republic, Ukraine.
Dozens of people were killed in clashes between protesters and Kazakhstan’s security forces in the early hours of Thursday, including 18 law enforcement officers, according to Russian state media. Initially sparked by a sharp increase in fuel prices at the beginning of year, the protests quickly spiraled into a broader outpouring of frustration with the resource-rich nation’s authoritarian leaders. Protesters accuse them of squandering its wealth, including its uranium reserves, echoing the kind of uprisings that toppled one of Mr. Putin’s protégés in Ukraine in 2014 and a wave of protests against Belarus’s pro-Kremlin leader in 2020.

The anniversary of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot is Washington’s theme of the week, and waves of righteous anger will roll across the Mall. We agree the riot was disgraceful, but then why not rewrite the law that encouraged Donald Trump’s supporters to think Congress could overturn the 2020 election?
We’re referring to the Electoral Count Act, the ambiguous 19th-century statute that purports to allow for a majority of Congress to disqualify a state’s electors after the Electoral College has voted. Congress’s certification of presidential election results should be a technicality, but Mr. Trump misled supporters into believing Vice President Mike Pence and Congress could overturn Joe Biden’s victory, leading to the Jan. 6 march on the Capitol.

Authorities in the Chinese city of Xi’an relented in some of their pandemic restrictions after a nationwide outcry over the account of a woman who lost her unborn baby in the eighth month of pregnancy after being denied medical attention for hours.
For two weeks, the city’s 13 million residents have been confined to their homes in response to an outbreak in which about 1,800 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19, a big outbreak for China. Most of Xi’an’s cases have been mild, authorities say, and no one has died of the virus. Still, the city has closed most public services in measures similar to those in Wuhan, the first epicenter of the coronavirus, two years ago. Only a limited number of Xi’an’s hospitals have been open to non-Covid-19 patients.

According to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the cause of rising prices isn’t “simply some inevitable economic force of nature—it’s greed.” The Biden administration, following Ms. Warren’s lead, has unleashed the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division to find the culprits. 
Strong stuff, but they’re actually on to something: Greed is causing at least some of the high prices American consumers pay every time they go shopping. Yet the villains aren’t the companies the Biden administration lawyers are targeting. The real culprit is closer to home—the White House’s own “worker-centric” trade policies, which are gouging American consumers and helping to stoke inflationary price increases.

Toronto couple Alan and Alison Schwartz were facing some major transitions as they planned their next home. They were moving out of a series of single-family homes into an apartment for their empty-nester years, and they were rethinking the focus of their extensive art collection. Their challenge was to create a home that was good for their cutting-edge art but comfortable for them.  Their strategy? Take it slow, allowing art and décor to merge into a lifestyle.
The couple paid 4.8 million Canadian dollars, or about $3.7 million,  in 2011 for two units in a new low-rise residential building in Toronto’s central Yorkville neighborhood. They then went on to spend $600,000 over the next several years to combine the two apartments into a 4,200-square-foot duplex with two bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms. They moved into the finished home in summer 2017, but they went on adjusting and rearranging for three more years, putting key pieces of art in place only this past year.

During a dark period in his youth, Bill Murray thought about killing himself while wandering the streets of Chicago. “I was ready to die,” the actor said at a press conference several years ago. That day he decided to visit the Art Institute and found himself in front of Jules Breton’s 1884 painting The Song of the Lark, which depicts a young woman looking skyward, sickle in hand, a violent orange sunrise behind her. Suddenly, Murray felt hope. “I just thought, Well, there’s a girl who doesn’t have a whole lot of prospects, but the sun’s coming up anyway and she’s got another chance at it,” he said. “That gave me some sort of feeling that I too am a person, and get another chance every day the sun comes up.” Murray credits the painting with saving his life.
Though making art has long been regarded as a form of therapy through self-expression, recently, the passive participation—the looking at art—is now being assessed as a different way of improving mental health. ​​“We know that for a lot of people, making art can be very therapeutic,” says Tim A. Shaw, artist and co-founder of the arts and mental health charity Hospital Rooms. “But also, making art isn’t usually an easy, relaxing thing for artists; it’s an uncomfortable pleasure.”

We’re in an acrimonious period of partisan tribalism and have been for some time. Both parties are guilty of overwrought denunciations of their political opponents. My criticisms are often aimed at Democrats; on the anniversary of Jan. 6, I’m addressing squarely those Republicans who for a year have excused the actions of the rioters who stormed the Capitol, disrupted Congress as it received the Electoral College’s results, and violently attempted to overturn the election.
 These apologists say those who stormed the Capitol were innocent patriots, tourists visiting the seat of the national government to petition their elected representatives peacefully. We’re told that these harmless, ordinary Americans are being persecuted as political prisoners.


Your browser does not support the audio tag.Opinion: Potomac WatchWhat's Missing From Congress's Jan. 6 AgendaLawmakers are planning to mark the anniversary of the Capitol riot, and former President Donald Trump canceled his own press conference. But Democrats want to use Jan. 6 as an excuse to overrule the Senate's filibuster to pass H.R.1, a federal takeover of elections. Why not instead focus on the riot's real causes, including the poorly designed Electoral Count Act? Meantime, what are Rep. Liz Cheney and the rest of the House Jan. 6 committee hoping to find?

Let’s stipulate that while the thousands who went to the Capitol a year ago were wrong to insist the election was stolen, most weren’t violent as they exercised their First Amendment rights to gather peacefully on the Mall—just as I had seen liberals gather to protest both inaugurations of President









      
      George W. Bush.



      
But last year there were several thousand protesters willing to use force to disrupt Congress in its constitutional duty to receive and certify the electoral vote. Some went to Washington with that purpose in mind. Others were swept up in the moment’s savagery, led astray by stronger wills with dangerous motives.

The leaders of this group were intent on committing violence, some having planned to do so for weeks. Many wore tactical gear. Some came armed with chemical agents, flagpoles, batons and sticks. They broke through barricades and assaulted approximately 140 police officers, in some cases with an officer’s own shield or gear. They smashed doors and windows, illegally entered the Capitol, ransacked offices and searched for leaders of Congress, and made dire threats about what would happen if they found them. 
More than 725 people have been charged so far, and law enforcement is searching for hundreds more suspects who appear on video or social media, some recorded attacking police officers. At least 163 people have pleaded guilty, and 71 have been sentenced. Only one defendant’s charges have been dismissed. Many of the most serious trials have yet to be held, as lawyers prepare defenses or negotiate plea deals. 
So, on this anniversary, here’s a simple thought experiment: What if the other side had done it? What if in early January 2017, Democrats similarly attired and armed had stormed the Capitol and attempted to keep Congress from receiving the Electoral College results for the 2016 presidential election? 
What if Democrats claimed that Donald Trump’s razor-thin victories in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin resulted from extensive voter fraud and should be rejected, despite having failed to establish in a single court that extensive fraud had actually occurred? 
What if some of these Democrats breached the Capitol defenses and threatened violence against the Republican speaker,









      
      Paul Ryan,



      and Republican Senate majority leader,









      
      Mitch McConnell



      ? 
What if they insisted that in his role as Senate president then-Vice President









      Joe Biden
      



      had sole authority to seat









      
      Hillary Clinton’s



      electors from any contested states and thereby hand her the presidency? 
If this happened, would some of my fellow Republicans have accepted it as merely a protest? Would they have called patriots those charged with violent acts against our country, its laws and Constitution? Would they have accepted such extralegal means to change the outcome of a presidential election? 
No they would not. I’m certain of that.
If Democrats had done what some Trump supporters did on that violent Jan. 6, Republicans would have criticized them mercilessly and been right to do so. Republicans would have torched any high official who encouraged violence or stood mute while it was waged and been right to do so. Republicans would have demanded an investigation to find who was responsible for the violence and been right to do so. 
To move beyond Jan. 6, 2021, we must put country ahead of party. For Democrats, that means resisting their leadership’s petty habit of aggravating partisan fault lines by indiscriminately condemning all who came to Washington that day.
We Republicans have a heavier burden. I’ve been a Republican my entire life, and believe in what the Republican Party, at its best, has represented for decades. There can be no soft-pedaling what happened and no absolution for those who planned, encouraged and aided the attempt to overthrow our democracy. Love of country demands nothing less. That’s true patriotism.
Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is author of “The Triumph of William McKinley” (Simon & Schuster, 2015).

The event formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show takes over Las Vegas in early January each year. This year, given the surge of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, it took place partly in cyberspace as well. Regardless of the adverse conditions, the show once again brought to light innovations from all corners of the globe that are pragmatic, flat-out bonkers or both at once.
Before the show began, the Consumer Technology Association, its host, expected between 50,000 and 75,000 in-person attendees. The CES organizer said Friday that over 40,000 turned up in Nevada. It also said it tallied over 2,300 exhibitors, more than initially expected. Two years ago, CES 2020, one of the last major U.S. events before the coronavirus lockdowns, drew over 170,000 attendees and more than 4,500 exhibitors.

PLANNING A VACATION well in advance has come to feel like playing a game of roulette. Will some new Covid variant leave a border closed when the wheel finally stops, or make Budapest suddenly look better than Buenos Aires? Travelers have responded by waiting until closer to their hoped-for departure dates to begin strategizing, and staying ready to change plans at a moment’s notice. 
In late November, Joe Sandillo, the founder of Latin America luxury specialist Almaz Journeys, organized a quick-pivot New Year’s trip to Colombia for a family of six. “They were booked to go to Israel,” he said. “As soon as Israel closed the borders, they shifted gears.” Along with a greater sense of safety, many travelers hope that waiting until the 11th hour to book can lead to deep discounts; Google searches for “last-minute hotel deals” have grown by 70% year over year.

A crisis may be imminent in Ukraine as Vladimir Putin gathers troops on the Russian border for a possible invasion. American policy makers have also begun focusing on a potential conflict in Taiwan, one that is coming to a boil more slowly. But American statesmen ought to understand: These events can’t be viewed in isolation; they are connected and part of a larger political competition for Eurasia.
Whether Mr. Putin is seriously considering action against Ukraine is an open question. But Mr. Putin has achieved three objectives simply by posing a credible threat. First, he has gained President Biden’s attention, and the two had teleconferences on Dec. 7 and 30. Russia views itself as a great power and wants to deal with other great powers directly, not via the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an execrable reminder of Russian weakness and Soviet collapse.

A year after David Dinkins, New York’s first black mayor, died at 93, the city elected its second black mayor, Eric Adams. While more than three decades separate their time in office, the city faces challenges in 2022 reminiscent of the Dinkins era.
Crime is surging, for starters. The New York Post reports that the murder rate has risen by 46% since 2016. Rape and felony assault have also increased. In the past two years, incidents of gun violence have more than doubled. Similarly, Dinkins’s first year in office, 1990, set a city record for the number of homicides, a problem his administration was never able to get under control. “Crime is tearing at the vitals of this city and has completely altered ordinary life,” said the head of a civilian watchdog group at that time. “Worst of all, it’s destroying the morale of our citizens.”

For almost two centuries the telecommunications industry has been at the forefront of human development, says Tech Mahindra’s Manish Vyas. As 5G rolls out, there is so much more to come

By Manish Vyas, President, Communications, Media and Entertainment Business and CEO, Network Services
I am deeply passionate about telecoms and the telecommunications industry, because, quite simply, since its inception almost 200 years ago it has been a massive force for good, connecting people and economies, and making the world smaller. From the widespread adoption of the electric telegraph in the 1840s to the current 5G revolution, it has been an industry that has been a major innovator in its own right and has also provided a platform for other innovators and disruptors. I would go as far as to say that it provides a vital human service to the world. 
Who could imagine the last two years without the fast, cheap and reliable telecommunications networks that enabled Zoom meetings, homeschooling and working from home? Many of us might have been locked down, but economic activity continued through the pandemic. Unfortunately, some industries were hit badly, but others thrived, often underpinned by telecommunications networks. 
What’s notable is that there are plenty of countries where only 5% or 6% of people have been vaccinated, but you won’t find a single country where people aren’t connected. Why is that? What has made telecoms such a reliable performer over the last two years? It is because telecoms is an industry that is founded on what I call ‘inclusive growth.’
While telecoms companies are, without a doubt, competitive, the industry is based on interconnected networks and technological collaboration. As an industry, when the pandemic hit, we knew global networks would have to cope with a huge increase in traffic. So, we communicated and coped. The telcos have been by far the most collaborative industry across the board.
Later into the pandemic we conducted research to find out why networks coped so well and came to a simple conclusion: Everything pointed to the fact that the long-term underlying investment the telcos have made in their network and design is at the heart of why the industry responded so admirably. This chimes with Tech Mahindra’s heritage. We were created 30 years ago as a telecoms joint venture between the UK’s BT and Indian conglomerate Mahindra Group. We have evolved over the years, but telecoms has remained a dominant part of our business, and an industry to which we make a great contribution. 
The last 15 years have been a period of major innovation for our industry. It has become increasingly apparent that telecommunications is about much more than voice and data coms. Four very clear themes have developed.
The first is ‘domain’. Networks are increasingly becoming ‘softwareized,’ which means they are less reliant on hardware that can get outdated. Increased use of updatable software makes for flexible, dependable, modern network solutions. 
The second is ‘disruptors’. We are seeing more of them and it’s good for the industry. Disruptors are the new agents of change. More and more people can contribute to the telecoms industry, which makes it less reliant on the large players. 
The third is ‘Cloud’. Industry adoption of the Cloud is increasing by the day, which is changing the way telcos write and use their software. 
Finally, ‘5G’. The adoption-rate of 5G is going to outpace the adoption of all the previous technologies, and its impact on all walks of life, from robotics to artificial intelligence and more, will be game-changing. 
Look at where we are now: just last week I was in India, and I visited a childhood friend in a rural village. ‘Rural’ in India is very different from ‘rural’ in the U.S.—the village is extremely remote. 
He used to trade in consumer electronics, such as televisions and air conditioning units. Now he’s stopped that; he’s got into closed-circuit cameras. He’s placing them on farms and connecting them to networks because both farmers and consumers want information in real time. He’s doing all this, already, on a 4G LTE network because that’s all that’s available in India right now. When 5G comes, the demand for connectivity will further increase, and business opportunities like this will multiply. 
5G isn’t available in South Africa yet either. Using LTE we’ve managed to build a private network for a major mining corporation. It gives them the ability to manage their fleet, their assets, their infrastructure and their people from a safety and security standpoint completely differently. Right now, with our network, they can put so many sensors on so many devices in a way they never could have done before. Projects like this will become almost normal when 5G and the Internet of Things come together and devices become connected as standard. 
While we are multinational, most of our business is now in the U.S. The customer-base that we have there is widespread and diversified, which means that the number of people we influence is huge. We work on network solutions for all the major telecom companies in the US market, almost all the major automakers and one of the largest providers of IT services to the US hospital services. 
From that vantage point, we are in a good position to see the way the industry—and 5G adoption—is developing. And it is clear to us that the 5G train has left the station. The last two generations of G have made the world better in so many ways that, practically speaking, 5G is going to be widely adopted at some point in the future. And, like everything in telecoms, it will spur connectivity, inclusiveness and innovation. I’m proud of this industry and I look forward to the future.

For almost two centuries the telecommunications industry has been at the forefront of human development, says Tech Mahindra’s Manish Vyas. As 5G rolls out, there is so much more to come

By Manish Vyas, President, Communications, Media and Entertainment Business and CEO, Network Services
I am deeply passionate about telecoms and the telecommunications industry, because, quite simply, since its inception almost 200 years ago it has been a massive force for good, connecting people and economies, and making the world smaller. From the widespread adoption of the electric telegraph in the 1840s to the current 5G revolution, it has been an industry that has been a major innovator in its own right and has also provided a platform for other innovators and disruptors. I would go as far as to say that it provides a vital human service to the world.

For many parents with school-age children, January started out a mess and is likely to get worse.
The Covid surge hitting just as kids are expected back in classrooms is making life unpredictable for parents yet again. Parents find themselves abruptly thrown back into a pandemic stage they thought they’d escaped: worrying about school cancellations, managing remote learning and calculating quarantine periods. Especially in places where case levels are acute, parents wonder how they will provide care and instruction for their children if they are sent home; some express uncertainty about the safety of going to school.

Deere


      & Co. said Tuesday that it has developed a fully autonomous tractor designed for large-scale farming and that it plans to sell the machine later this year.
The vehicle has the familiar green hue of a John Deere tractor. It sports a steering wheel in the cab, massive tires around classic yellow wheels, and a convolutional neural network, which comes standard in the autonomous tractor. It also features redundant braking and steering systems for an added layer of safety.
 The autonomous tractor is a version of Deere’s existing 8R series machine, the largest of which has 410 horsepower. Current 8R users can upgrade their tractors with the autonomous driving system.

The Deere tractor, unveiled at the CES 2022 tech conference in Las Vegas, isn’t the world’s first autonomous tractor. Smaller autonomous tractors are being used in specialty-crop farms.

The application of the technology to larger vehicles is just getting started and promises to be highly consequential, according to









      
      Aron Cory,



      research manager for world-wide agriculture at International Data Corp.
“The move from conventional tractors to autonomous tractors is going to be comparable from the move from horses to the combustion engine,” he said.
Deere said its new 8R series tractor is designed for large-scale farming applications. The Moline, Ill., company, founded in 1837, is the largest U.S. farm equipment manufacturer by sales.
Deere has yet to set the tractor’s price.
The autonomous driving system is equipped with six pairs of cameras, three in the front and three in the rear that provide a 360-degree view of the tractor’s surroundings. The images are fed to the onboard computer, where a convolutional neural network—an advanced form of artificial intelligence that analyzes images—classifies pixels in milliseconds, identifies objects in the tractor’s path, and determines whether the tractor should remain on course, steer around an obstacle, or stop.
A farmer monitors and manages the autonomous tractor from a mobile application that provides live video and continuous data on the machine’s operations. Farmers have the option to drive the vehicle from the cab.

Farm-equipment manufacturers, including several startups such as Monarch Tractor and Carbon Autonomous Robotics Systems Inc., have been working for years on driverless tractors and other autonomous machines for tasks such as planting, harvesting and weeding.
Monarch Tractor makes self-driving electric tractors with 40-70 horsepower engines. The tractors are being used at vineyards, orchards and other farms.

Deere also has been marketing its AutoTrac assisted steering system, which guides a tractor along a preprogrammed route using GPS and allows farmers in a cab to take their hands off the wheel so they can focus on field conditions and equipment settings. The option is available throughout Deere’s existing 8R series.
IDC said the sector is poised for rapid growth over the next five years as autonomous tractor technology matures, farm-labor shortages persist and agriculture companies continue to look for ways to increase farm productivity.
Autonomous tractors will have a significant impact on farming, said IDC’s Dr. Cory. The machines should be able to work around the clock, allowing for more efficient use of labor; better application of seeding, fertilizer and other inputs; and lead to higher yields and lower ecological impact, he said.

Other big farm-equipment manufacturers such as










            AGCO Corp.


      and










            CNH Industrial


      NV are working on autonomous tractors. AGCO, which owns brands such as Fendt, Massey Ferguson and Precision Planting, is developing a number of autonomous vehicles, from motorcycle-size planters to large farm tractors. The company said it plans to begin marketing these driverless vehicles within the next five years. CNH Industrial, which owns the Case IH and New Holland Agriculture brands, has developed a pair of autonomous concept tractors, but doesn’t have specific timelines for bringing them to market.
Deere 8R tractors packaged with the autonomous driving system will initially be set up to work autonomously with a chisel plow, which is used to till soil. But the company said that the tractor can be driven by farmers for other tasks and could eventually work fully autonomously with planters, herbicide sprayers and other farm equipment.
There are still hurdles to overcome before autonomous tractors become widely adopted. Farm equipment manufacturers need to prove to farmers that the devices can operate safely and that they aren’t vulnerable to cyber threats, IDC’s Dr. Cory said.
Deere said it has a full-time team dedicated to maintaining the security of its machines and farmers’ data.

Run in weighted leggings like those from Omorpho’s Mad Max-looking collection—which have half-spheres of weights dotted across the shins and thighs—and you’ll feel that extra resistance every time your feet push off the ground ($275, omorpho.fit). Play tennis in weighted arm sleeves like Kilogear Cut’s power shrug (from $75, kilogearcut.com) and you’ll work harder with every swing. Do a push up in Lila’s body armor-like Exogen top ($329, lilamovetech.com) and your arms will have to lift an extra one to 18 pounds of weight around your torso. (Adjust the resistance by slipping included weights of different sizes into the pockets.) Bonus: When you’re not wearing resistance, those moves will feel easier.

For nearly two years hospitals have subjected doctors and nurses to mind-numbing symptom and exposure checklists each day, without any evidence that they reduce hospital-based Covid-19 transmission. Healthcare workers live in fear of possible exposures, stuffy noses or positive tests that will keep them from being able to care for patients.

The U.S. agency said that if an infected person has access to testing and wants to get tested, the best method would be to use an antigen test, also known as a rapid test, toward the end of their five-day isolation period. The person should continue to isolate until day 10 if the test is positive, but can end isolation after five days if they get a negative result, as long as the individual wears a well-fitting mask around others.

The anniversary of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot is Washington’s theme of the week, and waves of righteous anger will roll across the Mall. We agree the riot was disgraceful, but then why not rewrite the law that encouraged Donald Trump’s supporters to think Congress could overturn the 2020 election?
We’re referring to the Electoral Count Act, the ambiguous 19th-century statute that purports to allow for a majority of Congress to disqualify a state’s electors after the Electoral College has voted. Congress’s certification of presidential election results should be a technicality, but Mr. Trump misled supporters into believing Vice President Mike Pence and Congress could overturn Joe Biden’s victory, leading to the Jan. 6 march on the Capitol.

Sen. Joe Manchin’s emphatic “no” to the current version of Build Back Better put the bill on life support. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, having promised a Senate vote, now must try to maintain the bill’s progressive priorities—including a raft of new and expanded entitlement programs—while shrinking its cost to meet Mr. Manchin’s concerns. A revised bill would almost certainly attempt to disguise the cost of these entitlements by making them initially less-generous. Experience teaches that no matter how slimmed-down the initial provision, an entitlement’s costs grow inexorably over time.
The history of U.S. entitlements is a 230-year record of continuous expansion and  liberalization. The first major entitlement, Revolutionary War disability benefits, was initially restricted to members of the Continental Army and Navy who were injured in battle and survivors of those killed in wartime. Eligibility was then expanded, first to state militia soldiers, then to veterans whose disabilities were unrelated to wartime service, and eventually to virtually all people who served during the war regardless of disability.

American chess grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura was at the World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships last week when he found himself without a clear move. He was in Warsaw, Poland. He had a flight home the next day. And he had just tested positive for Covid-19. 
The result threw the tournament—and Nakamura’s path home—into chaos. After an hour-long delay last Thursday, the final day of action proceeded without one of the sport’s pre-eminent stars. Nakamura has since been isolated in a Polish hotel room trying to figure out how and when he’s allowed to return to the U.S. As of Monday evening, he had yet to find a reliable answer.

Jeff Bezos, 57, is having fun with accessories, and his haters are having fun mocking them. In July 2021, the founder of Amazon.com Inc. and aerospace enterprise Blue Origin, flew to space while wearing a rather on-the-nose cowboy hat from upscale Aspen store Kemo Sabe. “I guess space turns you into Kenny Chesney,” joked Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show” then. Mr. Bezos’ girlfriend, journalist Lauren Sánchez, was photographed kissing him the day of the space flight while shielded by her own cowboy hat. Recently, the couple made headlines again by doing little more than posting a photo to Instagram of their outfits for a poolside disco-themed New Year’s Eve party.
But, oh, what a photo. In it, Mr. Bezos beams in a pair of tight white pants, a gaudy patterned silk shirt and heart-shaped sunglasses (at night), while Ms. Sánchez wears a racy sparkled jumpsuit with significant cutaways. They look like a couple that does little but work out and make out—the billionaire version of the cast of the reality show “Jersey Shore”—an impression reinforced by other photos taken of the pair during their 2021-2022 holiday break spent on a yacht with friends and family near St. Barth in the Caribbean. Through a representative, Mr. Bezos declined to comment.

Prosecutors proved that Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes defrauded big-name investors about the capabilities of her blood-testing startup. But their charges involving lower-profile patients fell flat after the government gave them a smaller stage at the trial.
At the heart of the case was the argument that Ms. Holmes attracted hundreds of millions of dollars from investors after launching patient-testing services that she falsely promised were ready for prime time, and she disregarded the chaos its inaccurate results could inflict on patient lives. In the end, Theranos voided tens of thousands of test results under pressure from regulators.

Democrats have spent a year trying to re-engineer the U.S. economy, redraft the nation’s social compact, and remake its political and legal institutions, all on the back of an imaginary electoral mandate. They’re going to spend a good deal of time in 2022 telling us how the Republican Party poses an existential threat to America as we know it. 
We should take a moment to step back, admire the chutzpah and deride the hypocrisy. Many of us have devoted a good deal of time in the past year to pointing out the darkly illiberal direction of modern progressivism and the cant that sustains it. But if we want to find the path back to national renewal, conservatives should resolve to acknowledge that the challenges to democracy come not exclusively from one side.

A nonprofit called the Center for Technology and Civic Life, or CTCL, funded by Mark Zuckerberg, says it gave $350 million to nearly 2,500 election departments in the course of the 2020 campaign. Last month it posted its 990 tax form for the period, with 199 pages listing grants to support the “safe administration” of voting amid Covid-19. Some conservatives see this largess of “Zuckerbucks” as a clever plot to help Democrats win.

The Cornell-Harvard hockey matchup is legendary. Harvard home fans used to play square-dance music and throw hay on the ice making fun of bumpkins from upstate New York. In retaliation, Cornell fans at Lynah Rink in Ithaca would throw fish on the ice (they still do despite being searched on entry), and for many years they even tied a live chicken to Harvard’s goal. I spoke with a recent graduate who explained how students have modernized taunting. Using fake social-media accounts with pictures of attractive coeds, hecklers would inevitably “friend” Harvard’s goalie and learn details about his personal life. During the game, the crowd would taunt him about his aunt Millie, dog Muffin or recent breakup. Eventually the goalie would turn and stare at the crowd in confusion. Successful psy-ops!
The same tactics are leaking into war planning. Psychological operations are nothing new: We’ve had Tokyo Rose, pamphlets dropped from planes, and Iraq’s Information Minister Baghdad Bob’s spewing lies on CNN. Now Instagram? In February 2012, I wrote a column titled “When Will Social Media Elect a President?” Most readers said never. Well, that ship has sailed. It’s time to ask: When will social media alter wars?

But Topps baseball cards will live on—as a part of Fanatics.  The sports-merchandise retailer has struck a deal to purchase Topps’ trading-card business from Michael Eisner’s Tornante Co. LLC and private-equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners., enabling Fanatics to keep the Topps brand alive. The purchase price was $500 million, people familiar with the matter said.

Across the U.S., 2021 was a bad year for crime. The New York City Police Department reported a 4.1% increase in homicides over 2020. Chicago’s increase was 5% and Los Angeles suffered a 13% rise in killings. The 2021 figures follow a scary 2020, when the nationwide homicide rate (6.5 per 100,000) was the highest in 23 years.
The pandemic, along with dubious criminal-justice system reforms, undoubtedly made things worse. Covid made police reluctant to interact with suspects except when making arrests for serious crimes. Wholesale releases from jails like New York’s Rikers Island put offenders back on the streets. Some states adopted bail reforms that kept offenders from jail entirely. It didn’t help that a new crop of progressive prosecutors, in misguided efforts to reduce so-called mass incarceration, declined to prosecute numerous misdemeanors and agreed to light sentences even for some violent felons.

OK millennial, you don’t care for us baby boomers. You complain that we’ve taken all the food off the table and left you the crumbs. You say we cling to our jobs and won’t make room for you. And you especially resent how, throughout, we took ownership of the zeitgeist, the spirit of the age.
In the 1960s we were a youth movement that demanded to be heard. We marched on the Pentagon and occupied college administration buildings. In the 1970s we mellowed, listened to the Band and the Eagles, and read Charles Reich’s “The Greening of America.” In the 1980s we rebounded as yuppies. We became investment bankers and lawyers, and the women among us wore suits with padded shoulders. Thereafter we ascended to political power—not always wisely, truth be told. But our music had lyrics and melodies, and our protest songs took on real injustices. We cemented a civil-rights revolution for women and minorities and left a mark on all succeeding generations.

Meanwhile, Iran held a massive memorial for Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani in the country’s capital to mark the anniversary of the American drone strike in Iraq that killed the military leader and an Iraqi militia commander on Jan. 3, 2020.

Families are bracing for bank balances to suffer when the middle of January comes and the monthly child-tax-credit payment doesn’t. 
More than 30 million households started getting up to $300 per child in July after Congress temporarily transformed an annual tax break into a near-universal monthly benefit. The full expanded credit went to households with incomes up to $75,000 for individuals, $112,500 for many single parents and $150,000 for married couples. Families spent the money on essentials like groceries and stashed it as emergency savings, researchers found.

Elizabeth Warren finally got her woman—that is, the Senator and her many acolytes in the Biden Administration have succeeded in ousting Jelena McWilliams as chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The coup deserves attention because of its norm-breaking precedent and what it signals for bank mergers and supposedly independent regulatory agencies. 
Ms. McWilliams resigned on Dec. 31, effective Feb. 4, to avoid more turmoil at the bank regulator. But as she wrote in these pages on Dec. 16, her resignation comes amid a concerted and unprecedented political effort to strip her of authority before her term as chair expires in June 2023.

Covid-19 infections continued to soar far above previous peaks across the U.S., as students returned to classrooms while some workers remained home after contracting or being exposed to the virus. 
The seven-day average of daily reported Covid-19 cases in the U.S. reached a pandemic record 403,385 on Sunday, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. The fresh peak arrived even as most states paused reporting during the New Year’s holiday weekend. Reporting delays will likely lead to spikes in reports of cases this week as states catch up. While Covid-19 tests remain in short supply in much of the U.S., Covid-19 testing was less robust last year, complicating comparisons between pandemic surges.

Stock markets in mainland China swelled to a roughly $12.7 trillion valuation in 2021, showing how domestic shares have largely been immune from the regulatory assault that has rocked many Chinese companies listed abroad.
The increase in market capitalization came partly from modest price gains—as of Dec. 31, the broad Shanghai Composite Index, for example, was up 4.8% from a year earlier—and partly from a rush of new listings in either Shanghai or Shenzhen. The growth cements China’s position as the world’s second-largest equity market.

But the experiences of Walmart and semiconductor giant  Intel Corp.  in recent weeks—and a consumer backlash against big brands such as H&M Hennes and Mauritz AB and  Adidas AG  last year—demonstrate a new willingness by Beijing to confront criticism by Western governments with counterattacks on Western companies.

They hoped to make contact with the mothers and fathers of other children who, like Steven, had been conceived with sperm from a particular donor sold by a sperm bank in Fairfax, Va.

For the Baggage Claim series, seasoned travelers unpack their devotion to a favorite piece of luggage or travel accessory.
THE BLACK-NYLON roller bag may still dominate most airport terminals, but fashionable fliers prefer their luggage a little shinier. The queen of the carousel, as far as I’m concerned, is the Rimowa. The fancy four-wheeler, with its grooved, hard shell often in silver, is among the priciest spinners around (the “Original” aluminum cases start at $1,100), but its long history, top-quality construction and celebrity fans give it a competitive edge.

The online Merriam-Webster dictionary defines “anti-vaxxer” as “a person who opposes the use of vaccines or regulations mandating vaccination.” Where does that leave us? We both strongly favor vaccination against Covid-19; one of us (Mr. Hooper) has spent years working and consulting for vaccine manufacturers. But we strongly oppose government vaccine mandates. If you’re crazy about Hondas but don’t think the government should force everyone to buy a Honda, are you “anti-Honda”?
 The people at Merriam-Webster are blurring the distinction between choice and coercion, and that’s not merely semantics. If we accept that the difference between choice and coercion is insignificant, we will be led easily to advocate policies that require a large amount of coercion. Coercive solutions deprive us of freedom and the responsibility that goes with it. Freedom is intrinsically valuable; it is also the central component of the best problem-solving system ever devised.

Joe Biden's plan for taking on the Omicron variant of Covid-19 involves 500 million free test kits, but why are they in such short supply in the first place? Meantime, President Trump says he got the booster shot and that his fans should ""take credit"" for Operation Warp Speed's role in developing the vaccines. Plus, Biden's vaccine mandate for employers reaches the Supreme Court.Read TranscriptADLoading advertisement...00:001xSubscribeApple PodcastsGoogle PodcastsSpotifyiHeartRadioTuneInStitcherAmazon AlexaRSS



Free choice relies on persuasion. It recognizes that you are an important participant with key information, problem-solving abilities and rights. Any solution that is adopted, therefore, must be designed to help you and others. Coercion is used when persuasion has failed or is teetering in that direction—or when you are raw material for someone else’s grand plans, however ill-conceived.
Authoritarian governmental approaches hamper problem-solving abilities. They typically involve one-size-fits-all solutions like travel bans and mask mandates. Once governments adopt coercive policies, power-hungry bureaucrats often spout an official party line and suppress dissent, no matter the evidence, and impose further sanctions to punish those who don’t fall in line. Once coercion is set in motion, it’s hard to backtrack.

Consider Australia, until recently a relatively free country. Its Northern Territory has a Covid quarantine camp in Howard Springs where law-abiding citizens can be forcibly sent if they have been exposed to a SARS-CoV-2-positive person or have traveled internationally or between states, even without evidence of exposure. A 26-year-old Australian citizen,









      
      Hayley Hodgson,



      was detained at the camp after she was exposed to someone later found to be positive. Despite three negative tests and no positive ones, she was held in a small enclosed area for 14 days and fed once a day. Even the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says quarantine can end after seven days with negative tests. Why didn’t the government let her quarantine at home? And why doesn’t it exempt or treat differently people who can prove prior vaccination or natural infection? 
Although U.S. authorities haven’t gone nearly that far, early in the pandemic the Food and Drug Administration used its coercive power to discourage the development of diagnostic tests for Covid-19. The FDA required private labs wanting to develop tests to submit special paperwork to get approval that it had never required for other diagnostic tests. That, in combination with the CDC’s claims that it had enough testing capacity, meant that testing necessitated the use of a CDC test later determined to be so defective that it found the coronavirus in laboratory-grade water.
With voluntary approaches, we get the benefit of millions of people around the world actively trying to solve problems and make our lives better. We get high-quality vaccines from BioNTech/










            Pfizer,
Johnson & Johnson


      and Moderna, instead of the suspect vaccines from the governments of Cuba and Russia. We get good diagnostic tests from










            Thermo Fisher Scientific


      instead of the defective CDC one. We get promising therapeutics such as Pfizer’s Paxlovid and Merck’s molnupiravir.
With authoritarian approaches, we get solutions that meet the requirements of those in power, regardless of how we benefit. Consider this hypothetical example: 
Policy A ends with 1,000 Covid-19 cases, 5,000 people who have completely lost their liberty for two weeks, 1,000 lost jobs, and 300 missed key family events, such as the funeral of a loved one.
Policy B ends with 1,020 Covid-19 cases, 4,000 who have lost some of their liberty for one week, 1,000 who have completely lost their liberty for two weeks, 300 lost jobs, and 100 missed family events.
The government may prefer Policy A because it is focused on one aspect of the problem. You might prefer Policy B because many aspects of life matter to you—not only coronavirus cases—and B is much better on the other dimensions. But your preferences don’t count.
With coercive solutions, you’ll often deal with an official who will absolve himself of responsibility by pinning the rule on those giving the orders. With voluntary solutions, if it doesn’t make sense, we usually don’t do it. And therein lies one of the greatest protections we have to ensure that the solution isn’t worse than the problem.
The supposed trump card of those who favor coercion is externalities: One person’s behavior can put another at risk. But that’s only half the story. The other half is that we choose how much risk we accept. If some customers at a store exhibit risky behavior, then we can vaccinate, wear masks, keep our distance, shop at quieter times, or avoid the store. 
Economists understand how one person can impose a cost on another. But it takes two to tango, and it’s generally more efficient if the person who can change his behavior with the lower cost changes how he behaves. In other words, to perform a proper evaluation of policies to deal with externalities, we must consider the responses available to both parties. Many people, including economists, ignore this insight.
By what principle do we throw out the playbook of the more successful country, ours, and adopt one from less successful, more authoritarian countries? The authoritarian playbook has serious built-in weaknesses, while solutions based on free choice have obvious and not-so-obvious strengths. Freedom is beneficial in good times; it’s even more crucial in challenging times. 
Mr. Henderson is a research fellow with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. He was senior health economist with President Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Hooper is author of “Should the FDA Reject Itself?” and president of Objective Insights, whose clients include pharmaceutical companies.

SHOWERING WASN’T really a thing in 18th-century France. There weren’t showers, for one. Clean water was scarce. To contemporary sensibilities, the pre-revolutionary French probably could have used at least a rinse. Especially since public sanitation was rudimentary and the streets held sewage runoff. In Patrick Süskind’s 1985 historical novel “Perfume,” he describes this period as foul: “...There reigned in the cities a stench barely conceivable to us modern men and women.”

That simple chore, which he thought would take a few minutes by phone, turned into a three-day undertaking. A comic book illustrator, Mr. Maleev, 49, used the time to produce what he calls the Lufthansa Files. He sketched the Marvel Comics superhero Daredevil on the first day during his hourlong wait before he got disconnected. The next day, he drew another Daredevil while on hold for an hour, then hung up. On the third day’s hourlong wait, he sketched Marv from the “Sin City” comic series, and posted the drawings on Twitter.

European governments are relaxing some quarantine requirements to help keep daily life open with new Covid-19 infections surging, while the top U.S. infectious-disease expert suggested health authorities might tighten isolation measures.
Countries have been grappling with isolation requirements, trying to balance health concerns as the Omicron variant takes hold, with the risk that those quarantine periods sideline medical staff, teachers and other workers for so long that hospitals, schools and other workplaces are unable to function effectively. Throughout the pandemic, Europeans have typically been required to self-isolate for 10 days if they or a close contact have tested positive for the virus. Some governments are responding to the threat of breakdown by shortening or otherwise easing their quarantine rules.

Hermione Marshall, a British teenager who works in a flower shop, was named after the heroine of the Harry Potter books and films. A 6-year-old in Ohio shares his name with Ollivander, the magical wandmaker from the series. Venerable wizard Albus Dumbledore has a namesake—a second-grader from Las Vegas who loves a good outer-space joke.
Parents have long named their kids after favorite characters across pop culture. “Game of Thrones” fans called their girls Daenerys (before the Mother of Dragons ruthlessly burned a city to the ground). Elsa became popular after “Frozen” came out. Now, as young readers who grew up with Harry Potter become parents themselves, they have given their children names straight out of the roll-call at Hogwarts.

Now it is leading much of the developed world toward a demographic cliff edge that could put a damper on Europe’s largest economy, raising pressure on its pension system and pushing inflation higher for years to come.
Economists forecast that Germany’s workforce could peak as soon as 2023 and then shrink by up to five million people by the end of the decade. While the pandemic has exacerbated the trend, it is the impending retirement of the baby boomers that is fueling the labor crunch, economists say.

One day six years ago, a friend and I went to a race at Virginia International Raceway, and I noticed this BMW Alpina there. I was a big fan of BMW M cars, which are the German company’s highest-performance line of customer vehicles. I had four of them, including a 2004 BMW M3 convertible in a rare Laguna Seca blue paint that I love, and a 2002 Z3 M coupe, the BMW people call the “clown shoe” because it’s shaped like, well, a clown’s shoe. But this BMW Alpina I spotted—I was instantly interested. Because an Alpina is a rare thing to find in the U.S. In fact, it’s rare to see one anywhere, even in Germany.

Much of Europe had succumbed to a mania about witchcraft, just over a hundred years before a similar frenzy swept over the town of Salem, Mass.
