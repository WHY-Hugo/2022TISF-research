The Manz family is scouring the ruins of their home for family heirlooms. Nan Boultbee and Lex Kell are still waiting for their street to reopen to catch a glimpse of the four-bedroom house they had lived in for five years, now torched. In this part of the drought-stricken West, wildfires come more often now. They sweep through neighborhoods and often retreat as quickly as they came, leaving behind new landscapes of suburban rubble — this one, after the devastating blaze that swept through the area around Boulder, Colo., softened under a sudden snow. But like the coals that were still glowing days later under the frost, the extent of what was lost and the challenge of what comes next is only now becoming apparent to those who lived in the 1,084 homes and other residential structures that were lost in one of the worst wildfires in Colorado history. On Wednesday, officials reported the first confirmed death from the blaze, announcing that they had found the partial remains of an adult about half a mile from an area being investigated as a possible source of the fire. One other person remained missing. “We all thought we were coming back,” said Ms. Boultbee, 66, a software programmer who escaped with her wife, Ms. Kell, also 66. Now she finds herself waking up in the middle of the night, asking, “Why didn’t I grab this or that?” They make their way down the ruined streets, searching for fragments from what was once their living room. They pore over rental ads on the internet, recalibrating their options in a housing market that had been tight and expensive even before the disaster. They talk about new definitions of what is safe and what is not, what should be considered important, who counts. At a shelter for evacuees, Mr. Giles held all he has left: a white plastic bag with a change of clothes, a backpack and the cat carrier holding Chloe. “I have to keep myself in check and stay strong for her,” Mr. Giles, 29, said of the 4-year-old tortoiseshell mix who has been at his side almost constantly since the blaze on Dec. 30. “She’s kind of my emotional anchor. I don’t know if I would have been able to handle this if we were separated.” Mr. Giles, who works as a private security guard, spotted the first plume of white smoke across the brittle grasses near his home in the town of Superior shortly before 11 a.m. that day. His subdivision, where he lived in a five-bedroom home with a roommate, was enveloped by smoke within half an hour. “It was so black, I couldn’t even see across the street,” he said. He scrambled to grab his roommate’s two dogs, as well as Chloe, before flagging a ride away from the flames. After that, a friend at work gave him a bicycle. Other friends are trying to pull together enough money for his first and last months’ rent on a new place to live. For the moment, though, Mr. Giles returns each night to the Red Cross shelter where he and Chloe are sleeping. He has had time there to reflect on what happened, but has not come up with any explanation for it. “There’s only one question I would ask,” Mr. Giles said. “Why me? Why now?” Hours after fleeing from the blaze, Andy Manz, 44, got a glimpse of its devastation. He and several homeowners “incognitoed it” back into their neighborhood on foot that night, against evacuation orders. Their way was lit by headlamps and the still-raging flames. “Our whole ridge was on fire,” said Mr. Manz, who copublishes Boulder Lifestyle magazine with his wife, Katie. “Our next-door neighbor’s was totally engulfed in flames. Our house was already burned to the ground.” Theirs was one of dozens of houses in the upscale Spanish Hills subdivision, from rustic 1950s ranch-style properties to contemporary dream homes, that were leveled to smoldering foundations and soot-scarred brick chimneys. The Manzes were at home when the fire leapt across U.S. 36, a nearby highway. They were able to gather their four children and rescue dog before making their escape. Ms. Manz said it was their first holiday season with an 18-foot Christmas tree that reached all the way to the living room ceiling. It was gone. The pearls handed down from her great-grandmother, they were somewhere in the ashes. So were the paintings. “The art was not really valuable, but it was valuable to us, because it was mostly by our kids,” Ms. Manz said. She held her daughter Farrah and they recalled the last thing they could remember about living there: It was the two of them, sitting over there on what was the couch, cuddling. “We still have the memory,” Ms. Manz said, “even though the room is gone.” Ms. Manz said she had been struck by something their oldest child, August, 11, had said. “He said: ‘It’s kind of cool to lose everything. We can do anything now,’” Ms. Manz recounted. She realized he was right. “It’s changing our perspective on material things,” she said. The family has been staying at the temporarily vacant home of friends in Boulder. They hope to rent one of the homes in Spanish Hills that survived the blaze until they can rebuild — though the insurance, they are realizing, will not cover all the costs. It could take years. Mr. Manz has been steering his Ford pickup through the snow-packed streets, looking to see whose homes were spared. “Every time I see a house that’s still standing, I’m just glad there’s one more house that made it,” he said. Yet the fire followed no logic; it left no explanations. “I believe in some divine intervention,” Mr. Manz said. “But I don’t understand it.” Nan Boultbee and Lex Kell fled their four-bedroom, 3,000-square-foot house in the Enclave subdivision, perched on the western perimeter of the city of Louisville. They have leaned on friends in the fire’s aftermath. The couple had frantically packed a few things — tax papers, a couple of changes of underwear, some sweats — and then drove out in separate cars with their two dogs, R.E., a 17-year-old Russell terrier and cocker mix, and Tucker, a 13-year-old beagle. The couple landed at the home of friends who live a few miles away. There, they met up with two other couples from their neighborhood, Cindy Stonesmith and her husband Matt, along with Hank Shaw and his wife, Joanne Speirs. The three couples had grown close through the pandemic, enjoying socially distanced outdoor dinners together, and in those first hours they shared tense stories about their hurried departures. But that same afternoon, they had to move again — the friend’s neighborhood was now being evacuated. Their next refuge was a Hampton Inn in Longmont, about 15 miles to the north. Their nomadic journey continued this week, as the three couples landed in an extended-stay lodge in the Denver suburb of Broomfield. Insurance will pay for them to stay there for the near future. After that, Ms. Kell and Ms. Boultbee thought they might be able to move on to a house-sitting situation at a friend’s home in Louisville — but plans to visit there to discuss an arrangement were temporarily scuttled when the friend reported symptoms that sounded like Covid. Now, they are looking to move there temporarily at the end of the month. If all goes as planned. Which so far, it has not. Several days into the new life that a natural disaster has forced them to confront, Ms. Kell was still navigating turbulent emotions. “I don’t think the reality of what happened has set in yet,” she said. “It’s shocking to know I have absolutely nothing. I just don’t. And we don’t have a home to go home to.” Their friends have made generous donations. “They are in tears for us,” Ms. Kell said. “That is overwhelming for us. Because we, too, are in tears.” But being with other friends who are similarly affected has been crucial. “The upside for us is being with the other two couples that are our immediate neighbors,” Ms. Boultbee said. “It has been amazingly important for all of us to be together, and to relax a bit with each other, and not focus on the enormity of what’s ahead for us. And, what’s gone from us.” It might be that no one knows in advance which of the things that are lost will mean the most. For Ms. Boultbee, one that loomed large was a bottle of Old Spice, the favored scent of her father, Jim Boultbee, who died in 2011. That scent has often helped her summon his memory. Her sister, who lives in California, arranged for a care package that got dropped off not long ago. In it, there was a board game to play through the long, anxious evenings; there were taco fixings, and crackers, glasses and cups. Also, a bottle of Old Spice."

The crisis in the oil-rich country marks the biggest challenge yet for the country’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, in power less than three years, and also threatens to destabilize an already volatile region. Mr. Tokayev requested the Russia-led intervention. The foreign soldiers were dispatched after the city hall in Almaty, the country’s largest city and former capital, was set ablaze on Wednesday, and the airport was overrun by an angry mob. Violence spread through the night. The police opened fire on the demonstrators, some of them armed, but also accused them of killing 18 law enforcement officers and troops, and leaving 750 injured. Throughout the day on Thursday, there were reports of continued clashes in Almaty, with the police saying they were “cleansing the city of militants.” Heavy gunfire echoed through the city. People hunkered in their homes posted videos of smoke billowing from buildings around the city. On Thursday night, the internal affairs ministry said it had regained control of all government buildings in Almaty. The reports of deaths could not immediately be independently confirmed. Kazakhstan, the world’s largest landlocked country, has some of the largest oil fields on earth and more than 40 percent of the world’s uranium production. But the average salary in Kazakhstan is the equivalent of $570 a month, according to the government’s statistics, and many are angry at socio-economic disparities, which have been made worse by the pandemic. The Russian-led effort to quell the unrest, described as a temporary peacekeeping mission by the military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, will be limited in time and will aim at protecting government buildings and military objects, the group said in a statement. The group has dispatched about 2,500 troops to Kazakhstan, and that figure could rise, its secretary general told the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. He would not say if they had been sent only to Almaty, or to other cities, as well. This is the first time in the history of the alliance, which is Russia’s version of NATO, that its protection clause has been invoked. Russian state-run outlets posted videos of Russian troops boarding military aircraft and others driving to Kazakhstan in armored vehicles. Saltanat Azirbek, a police spokeswoman in Almaty, said that dozens of people had been “eliminated” by the authorities when they tried to storm government buildings and the headquarters and district offices of the police, the first widespread fatalities since the protests started.  The authorities reported that in addition to those who had been killed, about a thousand people had been injured and up to 400 had been hospitalized. By Thursday, around 2,000 people had been detained in Almaty, the Kazakh interior ministry said in a statement read out on state television. Two of the members of the security staff that were killed had been beheaded, Almaty’s commandant’s office said in a statement carried by Khabar-24, Kazakhstan’s state news channel. The protesters also surrounded two hospitals in the city, the statement said. The police warned people living near main government buildings to stay at home. The Biden administration is closely watching Moscow’s military intervention in Kazakhstan, a Russian neighbor and former Soviet republic that Washington has cultivated as a friendly partner in recent years. U.S. officials see President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia’s response to the crisis as a test of his ability and determination to maintain a Russian sphere of influence in neighboring countries. Mr. Putin has warned against deepening Western involvement in Ukraine, and has massed troops along Ukraine’s eastern border for what American officials warn is a potential invasion of that country. Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, requested the troop deployment by a Russian-led alliance to help put down the uprising in his country. “We have questions about the nature of this request and whether it was a legitimate invitation or not. We don’t know at this point,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday. The State Department spokesman, Ned Price, noted in a separate press briefing that the Kazakh government has ample resources and is “well fortified,” but he said the U.S. would “defer” to the Kazakh government to explain its request for help. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke on Thursday morning with his Kazakh counterpart, Mukhtar Tileuberdi, the State Department said, and “reiterated the United States’ full support for Kazakhstan’s constitutional institutions and media freedom and advocated for a peaceful, rights-respecting resolution to the crisis,” the State Department said in a statement. Mr. Price also said on Thursday that the U.S. condemns acts of violence and destruction of property, and urged protesters “to express their grievances peacefully and for authorities to respond with restraint in order to seek a rights-respecting resolution to the crisis.” He added that the U.S. will watch closely for potential human rights violations, and what he called “any actions that may lay the predicate for the seizure of Kazakh institutions.” He also called on the government to restore internet service in the country. Among the Central Asian former Soviet Republics, Kazakhstan has been the friendliest country with Washington, a bond formed thanks to major energy investments by American corporations and the cooperation of the former Khazak president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, with the United States on nuclear nonproliferation. Mr. Nazarbayev also supported the American military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Kremlin blamed foreign influence for the unrest, but didn’t point to a particular country. In the past, Russia has accused the United States of fomenting protests in Ukraine and Georgia. “We consider the recent events in a friendly country to be a foreign-inspired attempt to use armed and trained groups of people forcibly to undermine the security and integrity of the state,” the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said in a statement, according to the Russian news outlet Sputnik. John R. Bolton, who served as national security adviser in the Trump White House, wrote on Twitter Thursday that Mr. Putin’s intervention in Kazakhstan was evidence that President Biden lacks a successful strategy for dealing with the Russian leader. “Putin is on the march, today in Kazakhstan. Are Belarus or Ukraine next? Biden’s ‘relentless diplomacy’ with Putin is failing,” Mr. Bolton said. Kazakhstan has long been regarded one of the most successful post-Soviet states. It has by far the highest G.D.P. per capita in the region and plenty of reserves, driven by billions in profits derived from its oil-rich western region. Most of this wealth, however, has not been equally distributed, with the elites living lavishly while many others survive on meager salaries and are left to complain in vain about widespread government corruption. Still, the scale of protests rocking the country has caught most Central Asian observers off guard.  According to Vladislav Inozemtsev, an analyst of post-Soviet affairs and special adviser to Russian Media Studies Project, the situation in Kazakhstan is a warning for the Kremlin: Under a surface appearance of stability, a pool of discontent might be brewing that could explode at any moment. “In Russia, the government must realize that 10 years without economic growth cannot make the population happy,” said Mr. Inozemtsev. “No geopolitical adventures can rescue it if the Kremlin doesn’t offer a mechanism that would increase the standards of living.” Another lesson of this week’s protests, Mr. Inozemtsev said, was that succession creates turbulence in authoritarian systems. In 2019, Mr. Tokayev formally succeeded Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan’s longtime president. But Mr. Nazarbayev continued to wield power. Mr. Nazarbayev handpicked Mr. Tokayev, whose first order of business was to rename the country’s capital in his predecessor’s honor. However, the new arrangement left the country’s bureaucracy disoriented.  On Wednesday, Mr. Tokayev appeared to be trying to use the unrest to consolidate power. He dismissed Mr. Nazarbayev from his post as chairman of the country’s Security Council, and also removed Mr. Nazarbayev’s nephew as deputy head of the main security service. All night and into the day on Thursday, young men roamed the streets of Kazakhstan’s largest city, Almaty, flanked by flames and buttressed by barricades. As stun grenades exploded and tear gas wafted in the air, demonstrators set fire to trucks, police cars and other vehicles, their smoldering hulks littering the streets. The first foreign soldiers from countries led by Russia landed in the Central Asian nation and found a land that had, for the moment, been plunged into anarchy. Some protesters came with firearms and started looting shops and malls, according to video footage posted from the scene. They set government buildings on fire, including the City Hall and the former office of the country’s president. They also captured the airport. Security forces responded with force, gunfire rattled the city throughout the day, and there were reports of dozens of people killed. On Thursday night, the government claimed to have retaken control of all official buildings in Almaty. The scale of the violence, which was evident in videos, postings on social media and official government statements, was still coming into focus on Thursday as unconfirmed reports of continued, sporadic clashes circulated on social media. With intermittent internet access and few independent witnesses, information coming out of the country was hard to verify. Galym Ageleulov, who has witnessed the events of the past few days, said he believed that a protest movement that was calling for peaceful change had been co-opted by throngs of criminals. Overnight, the streets were filled with mostly young men, many posing on social media with riot shields and helmets captured from the police. They were highly organized and managed by gang leaders, he said. “The police have disappeared from the city,” said Mr. Ageleulov, director of the human rights center Liberty in Almaty. “These gang members marched through the city looting stores and setting cars ablaze as they moved; they stormed the City Hall,” he said in a phone interview. “It was a horrible scene,” he said. By the morning, Almaty had been transformed: Commercial banks were ordered closed with many Kazakhs rushing to A.T.M.s desperate to withdraw cash; stores were closed, causing many residents to line up for bread, a scene unseen in the country for decades; at times, the internet has been shut down, disrupting basic infrastructure work. Almaty’s City Hall, an imposing white building that once served as the Communist Party headquarters, was charred black from the flames that burned through the night. Members of the special forces roamed the surrounding streets firing live ammunition trying to quell the uprising. The revolt began on Sunday in western Kazakhstan as a protest against a surge in fuel prices. Even though the government said it would rescind the price increase, the protests widened, spreading across the country, with broader demands for increased political representation and improved social benefits. The Kazakh president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, issued a statement late Wednesday night calling the protesters “a band of terrorists” who had been trained abroad. He declared Kazakhstan to be under attack and asked for intervention from Russia’s answer to NATO, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, to which his country belongs. The group is effectively led by Russia and also includes former Soviet countries in the Kremlin sphere of influence: Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The protests have paralyzed a nation of 19 million. In addition to the bank closures and internet shutdowns, the telephone system has been shut off sporadically, schools have extended their winter break by a week and flights in and out of airports in the cities of Almaty, Aktau and Aktobe have been suspended. Kazakhstan, where violent protests against the government have been raging, has some of the largest oil fields on earth and more than 40 percent of the world’s uranium production. So far the unrest does not seem to have cut into production of either oil or uranium, but it has the potential to ripple through critical energy markets. Uranium prices, which have risen in recent months on hopes of a revival of the nuclear industry to combat climate change, rose 8 percent on Wednesday amid reports of clashes in the Central Asian country. Some 22 percent of the uranium purchased by nuclear plants in the United States in 2020 came from Kazakhstan, according to U.S. government statistics. “Without Kazakhstan right now, the world would not be anywhere near well-supplied for uranium,” said Jonathan Hinze, president of UxC, which tracks the market, though he noted that utilities buy the fuel with long lead times. Any drop in oil output from Kazakhstan, which produces about 2 percent of world supplies, would also likely be felt in an already tight market. Some oil producers are not meeting the quotas allocated to them under agreements by the so-called OPEC Plus producers group. Kazakhstan, a member of the group, has been substantially exceeding its quota and is one of the few producers that looked likely to be able to increase output in the coming months. Oil prices jumped more than 2 percent on Thursday in futures trading on global markets, in part reflecting concerns about Kazakh unrest. “This is the sort of supply risk that has not been on anybody’s radar screen,” said Bill Farren-Price, director for intelligence at Enverus, an energy research firm. He added that oil analysts had mostly focused on problems elsewhere, including tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and recent cuts in production in Libya because of political turmoil. Since becoming independent with the fall of the Soviet Union three decades ago, Kazakhstan has been a magnet for Western energy investment. The Tengiz oil field, in the western part of the country near the Caspian Sea, is one of the world’s largest. Chevron and Exxon Mobil, the two largest American oil companies, are in the midst of an estimated $37 billion expansion at Tengiz field, which is a critical source of earnings for Chevron. Exxon, Shell, France’s Total, and Italy’s Eni are all shareholders in another huge field called Kashagan in the Caspian. These fields have helped make Kazakhstan a substantial oil producer, pumping about 1.6 million barrels a day (more than Nigeria, comparable to Mexico) and one of the few that is growing. The oil operations are also a crucial source of revenue for the Kazakh government. The fields are in remote areas, but oil workers have demonstrated at the Chevron-operated Tengiz field in sympathy with the protests. “A number of contractor employees are gathered at the Tengiz field in support of protests taking place across Kazakhstan,” said a statement on Thursday from Tengizchevroil, the Chevron-led joint venture in the country. It added, “Production operations continue.” Mr. Farren-Price said that the locations of these fields would tend to insulate them from disruption. But if the unrest gains momentum, he said, the oil companies might encounter operating problems, like difficulties moving people and supplies in and out of the sites.  The widespread disorder could also hurt Kazakhstan’s prospects for investment and credit. In a comment on Thursday, Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating group, attributed the civil unrest to what it called “structural weaknesses” in Kazakhstan’s institutions. The agency said that government policy was subject to what it called “succession risk,” with the longtime leader Nursultan Nazarbayev having been succeeded by another strongman, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, in 2019, and noted that “perceived corruption is high.” Central Asian governments have cracked down on previous popular uprisings with unflinching brutality in episodes that carry geopolitical consequences more than a decade later.  In Uzbekistan in 2005, security forces opened fire on crowds in the city of Andijan. In that incident, an Islamic opposition group called Akramia — named for its founder Akram Yuldashev — seized government buildings and released detainees from a prison. Soldiers surrounded a group protesting on a city square, then opened fire. The final toll is disputed. The president of Uzbekistan at the time, Islam Karimov, acknowledged 187 deaths. Human rights groups put the toll at around 750. Mr. Karimov retained power after the uprising. But the violence steered Uzbekistan more firmly into Russia’s orbit, as Russia largely backed Mr. Karimov while the United States criticized the shootings. In the wake of the American criticism, Mr. Karimov expelled the U.S. military from a logistics base in the country supporting the war effort in Afghanistan. In another mass shooting in Kyrgyzstan in 2010, protests that began in a regional city spread quickly to the capital, Bishkek. A crowd gathered outside the presidential office. The police opened fire but failed to control protesters who climbed over a security fence. The president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, fled the capital and within days was deposed. The new government estimated the death toll at 88 protesters. In that instance, the shootings tainted the United States’ standing in Kyrgyzstan; Washington was seen as supportive of Mr. Bakiyev despite troubling signs of corruption because his government provided access to an airfield and base used by the U.S. military to fly troops into Afghanistan. Sandwiched between Russia and China, Kazakhstan is the world’s largest landlocked country, bigger than the whole of Western Europe, though with a population of just 19 million. The latest demonstrations matter because the country has been regarded until now as a pillar of political and economic stability in an unstable region, even as that stability has come at the price of a repressive government that stifles dissent. The protests are also significant as Kazakhstan has been aligned with Russia, whose president, Vladimir V. Putin, views the country — a body double of sorts for Russia in terms of its economic and political systems — as part of Russia’s sphere of influence. For the Kremlin, the events represent another possible challenge to autocratic power in a neighboring country. This is yet another uprising against an authoritarian, Kremlin-aligned nation, following pro-democracy protests in Ukraine in 2014 and in Belarus in 2020. The chaos threatens to undermine Moscow’s sway in the region at a time when Russia is trying to assert its economic and geopolitical power in countries like Ukraine and Belarus. The countries of the former Soviet Union are also watching the protests closely, and the events in Kazakhstan could help energize opposition forces elsewhere. Kazakhstan also matters to the United States, because it has become a significant country for American energy concerns, with Exxon Mobil and Chevron having invested tens of billions of dollars in western Kazakhstan, the region where the unrest began this month. Although it has close ties with Moscow, consecutive Kazakh governments have also maintained close links to the United States, with oil investment seen as a counterweight to Russian influence. The United States government has long been less critical of post-Soviet authoritarianism in Kazakhstan than in Russia and Belarus."

Trump breached the United States Capitol in a violent riot that defiled a symbol of American democracy, the leadership of the Republican National Committee happened to gather, almost 700 miles away at a Ritz-Carlton on Amelia Island, Fla. In Washington, Mr. Trump’s political future had never appeared darker — and was dimming fast. He was an electoral loser. Top staff were resigning in protest. Prominent allies were repudiating him. Social media giants would soon banish him. But the seeds of a political revival, at least within his own party, were there from the start. With broken glass and debris still scattered across the Capitol complex, well over half of House Republicans voted against certifying the election, echoing Mr. Trump’s false claims of fraud. Even as the national committee drafted a statement condemning the violence — it did not mention Mr. Trump by name — some committee members pressed to add an expression of sympathy for the views of the crowd that had mobbed the Capitol. They had to be overruled. The next morning, Mr. Trump called into the committee’s meeting via speakerphone. “We love you!” some of the attendees shouted. “Many of us from the Northeast states just rolled our eyes,” said Bill Palatucci, a Republican national committeeman from New Jersey and a prominent Trump critic inside the party. But more common was the view of members like Corey Steinmetz, of Wyoming, who said in an interview that blaming Mr. Trump for the events of Jan. 6 was “nothing more than a sham from the get-go.” Today, the Republican Party is very much still Mr. Trump’s, transforming his lies about a stolen 2020 election into an article of faith, and even a litmus test that he is seeking to impose on the 2022 primaries with the candidates he backs. He is the party’s most coveted endorser, its top fund-raiser and the polling front-runner for the 2024 presidential nomination. Mr. Trump is also deeply divisive, unpopular among the broader electorate and under investigation for his business practices and his interference with election officials in Fulton County, Ga. He remains the same politician whose White House oversaw four years of devastating Republican losses, including of the House and Senate. And while a scattered few Republicans publicly warn about yoking the party to him, more fret in private about the consequences. Yet his unrivaled power inside the G.O.P., one year after inciting the sacking of the Capitol to forcibly forestall the certification of the election, is a testament to his unrelenting hold on the loyalty of the party base. His rehabilitation — to the extent one was even needed among Republicans — is the latest example of an enduring lesson of his tumultuous time in politics: that Mr. Trump can outlast almost any outrage cycle, no matter how intensely it burns. The spotlight shifts. The furor fades. Then, he rewrites history. For Jan. 6, the warped narrative that Mr. Trump has spun is that “the real insurrection happened on Nov. 3rd” — the date he lost a free and fair election. There was a fleeting moment, in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack, when Republican leaders in the House and Senate had an opportunity to break cleanly with Mr. Trump, as Democrats moved swiftly to impeach him. “Count me out,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a staunch Trump ally, had said that night on the Senate floor. “Enough is enough.” But if some Republican lawmakers who had narrowly escaped the violence that day were at a breaking point, Republican voters were less moved. Within a month, in early February 2021, an AP-NORC Poll found that only 11 percent of Republicans said Mr. Trump bore a great deal or quite a bit of responsibility for the breach of the Capitol; that figure is at 22 percent today. Republican politicians quickly realigned themselves to comport with public opinion. In less than a week, Mr. Graham was back at Mr. Trump’s side, riding Air Force One, and he repeatedly visited Mr. Trump’s golf courses for face time with the former president in the last year. Perhaps the first most consequential pivot back to Mr. Trump came from Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, who had said on Jan. 13 that Mr. Trump “bears responsibility” for the riot. By the end of the month, he was on a plane to Mar-a-Lago to try to keep the peace. An article was published about the closely-guarded meeting ahead of time. “Did you leak it?” Mr. Trump said to Mr. McCarthy twice, according to two people briefed on the discussion. Mr. McCarthy said he did not. Mr. Trump smiled slightly and shrugged his shoulders, seeming to acknowledge that Mr. McCarthy hadn’t been the leaker. “But it’s good for both of us, Kevin,” Mr. Trump said. A spokesman for Mr. McCarthy declined to comment, while a spokesman for Mr. Trump denied the exchange took place. Afterward, Mr. Trump’s PAC released a photo of the two men side by side. In the Senate, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, had been more forceful in denouncing Mr. Trump. “President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,” Mr. McConnell declared in a floor speech, adding, “The leader of the free world cannot spend weeks thundering that shadowy forces are stealing our country and then feign surprise when people believe him and do reckless things.” But Mr. McConnell ultimately voted to acquit Mr. Trump at his impeachment trial on a charge of inciting the insurrection. Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell are not on speaking terms now, though Senator Rick Scott of Florida, the chair of the Senate Republican campaign arm, has been solicitous of Mr. Trump, even giving him a new “Champion for Freedom” award on a trip to Mar-a-Lago in April. That same weekend, at a Republican National Committee fund-raiser, Mr. Trump ripped Mr. McConnell while speaking to donors, uttering a crude insult to his intelligence. On his way out of office, Mr. Trump had fumed about starting a third party of his own, though he closed the door on that idea in his first post-presidential speech in late February, at the Conservative Political Action Conference of pro-Trump activists. Instead, he said, he planned to take back command of the G.O.P. and cleanse it of his critics. “Get rid of them all,” he said. Mr. Trump has already endorsed candidates in nearly 100 races in the midterms, setting up the 2022 primary season as something of a vengeance tour against those Republicans who dared to cross him. Some advisers worry his expansive set of endorsements will expose him to stinging potential losses that could signal a weakening of his sway over the Republican electorate. Still, Mr. Trump has recruited challengers to his loudest G.O.P. critics, such as Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who was purged from House leadership for refusing, in her words, to “spread his destructive lies” about 2020. Whit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster, said that Mr. Trump’s backing was powerful in primaries, but a “very, very mixed blessing” in swing districts. “It’s pretty clear that candidates who want to be competitive in the general election are being careful how close they get to him during primaries,” he said. He pointed to Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin of Virginia as having offered a “classic example” of the type of balancing act necessary. One reason it has been so hard for party leaders to break from Mr. Trump is that he remains the dominant fund-raising force among the party’s grass-roots donors. After effectively shutting down his campaign finance operation following the Capitol riot, Mr. Trump fired it back up the day of his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference. He raised nearly $3.5 million online that day, federal records show — a one-day haul not approached by any G.O.P. politician or committee in the first half of 2021. The money is as powerful a measure of his influence as his polling. By early summer, Mr. Trump was almost single-handedly matching the entire Republican Party apparatus online. The R.N.C., plus the House and Senate campaign committees, raised a combined $2.34 million online in the last five days of June. Mr. Trump’s committees raised $2.29 million. The party continues to rely heavily on pro-Trump messages to motivate online supporters. The R.N.C., meanwhile, has agreed to foot up to $1.6 million of Mr. Trump’s personal legal bills. The events of Jan. 6 have not been without consequences for Mr. Trump. The former president initially planned to hold a news conference on the anniversary, but abruptly withdrew on Tuesday on the advice of allies and advisers that it would backfire. And while Mr. Trump remains popular with Republicans, recent 2024 primary polls show potential vulnerability, even as he now outpaces the field handily. In a sign of fatigue even among his supporters, a notable share of Republicans say they would prefer he not run again, as many as 40 percent in a Marquette Law School Poll in November. That survey also showed 73 percent of independents prefer he not run. Some Republicans, such as Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who has consistently polled a distant second to Mr. Trump, have avoided saying whether they would not run if Mr. Trump does.  Others, most notably Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, have said Mr. Trump’s decision will not affect their own. Mr. Christie, a former adviser who broke with Mr. Trump after Jan. 6, has emerged as one of the few prominent Republicans pushing back on Mr. Trump’s deceptions about the 2020 election. After Jan. 6, Mr. Trump’s banishment from Facebook and, in particular, Twitter, was consequential, keeping him off platforms that had allowed him to reach tens of millions of people directly. Privately, some Trump advisers believe that his online absence has been a blessing in disguise, keeping him out of the public eye as President Biden faces the twin political challenges of rising inflation and a surging virus. But now Mr. Trump is planning a bigger public profile in 2022, scaling up a political operation and a more intense travel schedule of rallies. And he obsesses over his win-loss record in Republican primaries: “152-2 on endorsements,” he told the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt last month, adding, “I take that very seriously.” Mr. Trump has said he will not announce his plans for 2024 until after the midterms. But when Mr. Hewitt asked what would happen to his base if he did not run, Mr. Trump was quick with a reply. “If I do decide that,” he said, “I think my base is going to be very angry.”"

Trump. On Thursday, Mr. Biden took deliberate aim at Mr. Trump, assailing him for watching television as the attacks unfolded, spreading a lie that the 2020 election was rigged, and holding “a dagger at the throat of America” when he encouraged his supporters to attack the United States Capitol. But Mr. Biden held on to one vestige from the past year: He still refused to call Mr. Trump by name. Here are four takeaways from the day. As president-elect in November 2020, Mr. Biden and his staff proceeded with the transition process by treating Mr. Trump’s attempts to reverse the election as little more than histrionics. The calculation made back then by Mr. Biden and his advisers was that America was simply ready to move on, but on Thursday, the president was more willing than usual to address Mr. Trump’s claims, calling him a loser in the process. “He’s not just a former president. He’s a defeated former president — defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes in a full and free and fair election,” Mr. Biden said. “There is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate.” His remarks set him down a more confrontational path with Mr. Trump, who holds a firm grip on his party and shows no sign of backing down from continuing to perpetrate a false narrative about the 2020 election. It is a development Mr. Biden spent his first year in office avoiding, but one that he seemed to embrace as a matter of necessity on Thursday. On his Inauguration Day just under a year ago, Mr. Biden promised to be “a president for all Americans. I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did.” On Thursday, he appeared not as the peacemaker president but as a leader who had a warning for Americans who attacked the Capitol in service of Mr. Trump. “I did not seek this fight brought to this Capitol one year ago today, but I will not shrink from it either,” Mr. Biden said. “I will stand in this breach. I will defend this nation. And I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy.” Mr. Biden also reserved some of his ire for elected officials. For a leader who came into office speaking poetically about the art of bipartisanship — “politics is the art of the possible,” he said early on — and about the need to heal a fractured nation, Mr. Biden suggested that he was only interested in working with Republicans who have not tied their political fortunes to the falsehoods spread by Mr. Trump. “While some courageous men and women in the Republican Party are standing against it, trying to uphold the principles of that party, too many others are transforming that party into something else,” Mr. Biden said. “But whatever my other disagreements are with Republicans who support the rule of law and not the rule of a single man, I will always seek to work together with them to find shared solutions where possible.” The president’s remarks presented a stark choice: “Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies?” In corners of the internet governed by Mr. Trump and his supporters, the answer seemed clear. On a podcast hosted by Stephen K. Bannon, a former Trump aide who was indicted in November for failing to comply with congressional investigators, Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia deflected blame for the attack and suggested it was part of a government conspiracy. In his own cascade of statements, Mr. Trump showed no sign that he was going to shrink from a fight. He assailed Mr. Biden for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, and even the way he delivered his Thursday remarks. “He acts like he’s aggrieved,” Mr. Trump said in one of several statements, “but we’re the ones who were aggrieved, and America is suffering because of it.” The Republican Party remains very much Mr. Trump’s, his lies about a stolen election a litmus test that he is seeking to impose on the 2022 primaries with the candidates he backs. He is the party’s most coveted endorser, its leading fund-raiser and the early front-runner in polling for the 2024 presidential nomination. Mr. Trump has a rally scheduled in Arizona next week. Mr. Biden’s forceful condemnation of Mr. Trump was echoed by Democrats across the Capitol. Republicans were mostly absent. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, accompanied by her father, appeared to be the only elected Republican among dozens of lawmakers who gathered on the House floor on Thursday afternoon. Many Senate Republicans were out of town for the funeral of a former colleague. Republicans were not totally silent. While calling last Jan. 6 “a dark day,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, said in a statement that it has “been stunning to see some Washington Democrats try to exploit this anniversary to advance partisan policy goals that long predated” the chaos at the capitol, a likely reference to a Democrat-led push for voting rights legislation. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who condemned the events of the day when they happened only to reverse course soon after, accused Democrats of politicizing the anniversary: “Their brazen attempts to use Jan. 6 to support radical election reform and changing the rules of the Senate to accomplish this goal will not succeed,” Mr. Graham said. But there were some voices among unelected Republicans calling for something of a reckoning over the party’s support for Mr. Trump. Karl Rove, the strategist who helped George W. Bush win the presidency twice, used his Wall Street Journal opinion column to rebuke “those Republicans who for a year have excused the actions of the rioters who stormed the Capitol, disrupted Congress as it received the Electoral College’s results and violently attempted to overturn the election.” For a day or two or maybe a week after the can-you-believe-this-is-happening-in-America events of a year ago, there were those who thought that the shock to the system might upend politics in a profound way. That the country might speak as one against an attempt to overturn democracy. That the tribal divisions of the era might be overcome by a shared sense of revulsion. That a president who encouraged a mob that attacked Congress in a vain bid to hold onto power might be ostracized or at least fade into exile. That was then. A year after the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol in which supporters of President Donald J. Trump trying to stop final recognition of a certified free and fair election burst through barricades, pummeled police officers and forced lawmakers to flee for their lives, what is most striking is not what has changed, but what has not. America has not come together to defend its democracy; it has only split further apart. Lies and disinformation spread by the former president have so permeated the political ecosphere that nearly universal outrage has reverted to separate blue and red realities. Far from shunned for what even his own vice president deemed an unconstitutional attempt to thwart the will of the voters, Mr. Trump remains the undisputed powerhouse of his party — and a viable candidate to reclaim the White House in three years. ATLANTA — On a day when Washington’s partisan divide felt as deep as it has in decades, lawmakers from both parties gathered in an Atlanta church on Thursday to honor one of the U.S. Senate’s great champions of bipartisanship, Johnny Isakson. Mr. Isakson, a moderate Georgia Republican who once called bipartisanship “a state of being,” was 76 when he died on Dec. 19, having retired prematurely from the Senate in 2019 because of health complications. He was battling Parkinson’s disease. In Washington on Thursday, most Republican legislators refused to take part in the commemorations of the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol by supporters of former President Donald J. Trump. But they came together at Peachtree Road United Methodist Church, in Atlanta’s Buckhead neighborhood, to honor Mr. Isakson. Among the attendees were Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and Senator Raphael Warnock, the Democrat who was elected to Mr. Isakson’s old Georgia seat last January. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, delivering words of remembrance, acknowledged that the funeral resonated in a spirit of comity that the Senate was once known for, but that has lately become more scarce. “I haven’t seen this big of a bipartisan group of Senators together off the floor since September,” he said. That, he said, was the date of an annual, “Johnny Isakson barbecue lunch,” a social tradition that Mr. Isakson started and that lawmakers have continued in his absence. Former U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss, an old friend of Mr. Isakson’s, also delivered remarks, noting that in his farewell speech to the Senate, Mr. Isakson said that he divided the world into two categories: friends and future friends. Mr. Chambliss recalled that Mr. Isakson also quoted Mark Twain’s advice to do the right thing, on the grounds that “It will gratify some people and astonish the rest.” Mr. Isakson held firm conservative beliefs, opposing the Affordable Care Act and gay marriage, but he also bucked the party’s status quo at times, and he was not afraid to publicly criticize Mr. Trump. Along the way, he made numerous friends in both parties; Mr. Chambliss said that former Georgia Governor Roy Barnes, a Democrat, once quipped, “If all Republicans were like Johnny Isakson, I would be a Republican.” The pews were packed with friends and admirers from both parties, including Mr. Barnes. The top statewide elected officials in attendance included Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, both of whom are facing tough primary challenges from pro-Trump challengers. A folk duo underscored the tone with a rendition of “Let There be Peace on Earth.” When they sang “God Bless America,” the mourners stood up en masse. Congressional Republicans almost uniformly avoided participating in events at the Capitol on Thursday commemorating the Jan. 6 attack; they were nowhere to be found on the House or Senate floor. That left Representatives Matt Gaetz of Florida and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, two far-right lawmakers on the fringes of the Republican Party, as the headliners of their party’s only event on Capitol Hill on Thursday commemorating the anniversary of the riot. Speaking from an office building near the Capitol, they elevated unproven conspiracy theories about the origin of the assault that sought to deflect blame from former President Donald J. Trump, such as one suggesting that federal agents stoked the violence against Congress. There is no evidence that federal agents played any role in the assault, which occurred when supporters of Mr. Trump, who falsely claimed the election had been stolen from him, stormed the Capitol while Congress was counting the electoral votes to formalize President Biden’s election. Still, Ms. Greene and Mr. Gaetz decried the treatment of the people charged with taking part in the riot, who are being held without bail at a jail in Southeastern Washington, D.C. Both lawmakers are considered outliers in their party. Democrats booted Ms. Greene off her congressional committees for posting violent social media posts that predated her election to Congress, and Mr. Gaetz has been dogged by a federal child sex trafficking investigation. But their unyielding allegiance to Mr. Trump — and their willingness to mirror his bombastic rhetoric — has won them a devoted following among hard-right conservatives across the country and online, a standing they will no doubt attempt to parlay into power should Republicans win the House later this year. Breitbart News called it the “Democrat Day of Hysteria.” Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, went on Fox News to criticize President Biden for a “mass obsession with Donald Trump.” The right-wing pundit Ben Shapiro wrote on Twitter that “this January 6 extravaganza will earn a standing ovation from the media echo chamber, and achieve nothing else.” Many conservative media outlets covered Thursday’s anniversary of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot by lobbing criticism at Mr. Biden for his morning speech, which accused his predecessor of holding a “dagger at the throat of America.” Pro-Trump commentators called that an unnecessary politicization of the day’s events that would divide Americans. One chief narrative on conservative platforms was the notion that Democrats and mainstream journalists had overblown the attack on the Capitol and were overly fixated on Thursday’s commemoration of Jan. 6, which marked the first interruption of the peaceful transfer of power in American history. “Unless you were there that day, you cannot possibly understand what it was like,” the Fox News host Tucker Carlson said on Wednesday evening, mocking what he deemed an overly emotional response by reporters. “Imagine the Tet offensive, plus Falluja, plus the night before Thanksgiving at Whole Foods.” Fox News carried Mr. Biden’s speech live on Thursday morning, along with analysis from its political staff and a report from the congressional correspondent Chad Pergram, who covered the riot in person that day. Bret Baier, Fox’s chief political anchor, cautioned that the comments of Vice President Kamala Harris, which included references to major attacks on the United States, could stoke criticism from conservatives. “The fact that the vice president conveyed that Jan. 6, 2021 was like Dec. 7, 1941, and Sept. 11, 2001 — even for some people who are going to condemn the attacks and the riot, they’re going to find that, I think, pretty hyperbolic,” Mr. Baier said. “And for 9/11 family survivors, maybe insulting. We may see that backlash.” Mr. Baier is set to interview Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming and a sharp Trump critic, at 6 p.m. on his flagship program. Still, there were long stretches where Fox News entirely set aside the subject of the Capitol attack. The network’s 2 p.m. hour came and went without a mention of the anniversary or of Mr. Biden’s speech, a period when CNN and MSNBC carried wall-to-wall coverage of the anniversary, including live remarks from lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Instead, “America Reports,” Fox News’s afternoon newscast, ran segments on the closure of the Chicago public school system, a possible change of venue for the Super Bowl, and ties between the billionaire George Soros and prosecutors in Chicago, San Francisco and elsewhere. In that particular hour, even Newsmax, which is known for a more sharply right-wing approach than Fox News, ran anniversary coverage. One segment included a correspondent’s on-air reminder that Mr. Trump’s claims of election fraud were “rejected unanimously by the courts and even his own attorney general.” One America News Network, a far-right channel carried in some 35 million households, ran a segment about “the patriotic demonstrations at the Capitol on Jan. 6” that amplified a range of conspiracy theories, including the falsehoods that the attack was predominantly peaceful and a ploy by liberals to strip patriotic Americans of their liberties. “Leftist, Media Narrative Surrounding January 6th, 2021 Simply an Excuse for Democrats to Seize Power,” read an onscreen headline.  On Wednesday, Mr. Carlson, the top-rated Fox News host, used his show to continue his revisionist approach to the Jan. 6 riot and to mock liberals and journalists who were emphasizing the significance of its anniversary on Thursday. “Pretending that a protest was actually a failed coup is the Democratic Party’s entire strategy to win this year’s midterm election,” Mr. Carlson told viewers. “At this point, it’s all they’ve got.” Two days before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, J. Michael Luttig, a retired former federal appeals court judge, found himself enmeshed in a brewing constitutional crisis. A former law clerk of his, John C. Eastman, was telling President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence that the vice president essentially had the authority to insert himself into the election certification to help overturn the election results. At the same time, Mr. Luttig’s longtime friend, Mr. Pence’s personal lawyer, Richard Cullen, was asking Mr. Luttig to use his position as a leading conservative legal scholar to publicly proclaim there was no legal basis for Mr. Pence to help Mr. Trump — a move that would help give Mr. Pence political and legal cover to push back on Mr. Trump. Mr. Luttig, whom George W. Bush considered to become chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, found Mr. Eastman’s arguments preposterous and publicly said that Mr. Pence had no choice. Ultimately, Mr. Pence cited Mr. Luttig in a letter he released on Jan. 6 explaining why he was not standing in Congress’s way as lawmakers certified the results. A day after the Capitol attack, Mr. Pence called Mr. Luttig to thank him. A year later, Mr. Luttig said that he had never been more concerned about the direction of the country’s democracy. “I was gravely worried for our country last Jan. 6,” Mr. Luttig said in an email. “A year later, I am even more worried, fearful of the peril that lies ahead for America. We are at an historic inflection point as to who we are and who we are going to be as a nation. History is watching and anxiously awaiting our decision.” Federal officials have seen an uptick in online threats related to the anniversary of the Capitol attack — including a video calling for a mass hanging of lawmakers — but they cited no new, credible evidence of organized plots, according to a memo obtained by The New York Times. In the past 48 hours, officials with the F.B.I. and Department of Homeland Security have flagged posts on “extremist related platforms” that might incite “lone offenders” to take violent action against members of Congress, state and local officials and high-profile members of political parties, according to the memo, written by John D. Cohen, intelligence chief of the Homeland Security Department, to update government partners on Thursday. Mr. Cohen said any new attacks inspired by the posts could target officials and government installations inside or outside of Washington. “The potential threat of violence could extend beyond” the capital region, he wrote, adding the reports were “being investigated, as appropriate.” The Capitol was heavily guarded on Thursday as President Biden and Vice President Harris arrived to deliver speeches in Statuary Hall, though not nearly at the level of protection it had in the days after the riot, when National Guard troops camped out in the hallways and protective fencing was installed. On Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Chief J. Thomas Manger of the Capitol Police acknowledged the heightened threats, but said their departments were better prepared to confront possible threats than they were a year ago. While most online threats turn out to be bombastic noise, Mr. Cohen singled out a few examples of online threats that F.B.I. officials found particularly worrisome. An unknown individual on a QAnon forum posted a video online listing 93 members of Congress who voted to certify the “fraudulent” 2020 presidential election, and called for them to be strung up in front of the White House, he wrote. The video was originally put online last month, but it was reposted multiple times on Telegram and other platforms this week, garnering about 60,000 views. Another online post encouraged Trump supporters to assassinate Democratic political figures, including President Biden, because of a false perception that he was elected fraudulently. Homeland Security officials have shared the information with the Secret Service, the Capitol Police and the Washington Metropolitan Police. In light of that reporting, the Federal Protective Service has also expanded patrols in and around federal facilities across the country. The warning comes after federal officials outlined a range of potential threats associated with the commemoration of the Jan. 6 attack. That assessment found no credible or concrete evidence of an organized attempt to launch a similar attack, but also warned about the possibility of lone-wolf attacks, whipped up by misinformation and incitement to violence. The most likely offenders would be people “who adhere to ideologies associated with promoting the superiority of the white race, militia violent extremism, and conspiracy theories, including those related to QAnon,” the Homeland Security Department concluded in that separate memo dated Dec. 30. Our political journalists talked about the G.O.P.’s push to restrict voting and seize control over elections, and how Democrats are responding. There were just two Republicans present in the House chamber for a moment of silence commemorating the Jan. 6 riot in the Capitol: Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, and her father, Dick Cheney, the former vice president. Ms. Cheney, who has taken a leading role in the special committee investigating the attack, has been ostracized by her party as she continues to condemn former President Donald J. Trump, his lies about the 2020 election, and the Republican Party’s role in helping to spread them, as well as its efforts to play down or deny the severity of the riot. So while Republican leaders stayed away from the remembrances at the Capitol on Thursday, Ms. Cheney — who was ousted from her leadership post for speaking out against Mr. Trump — was the only elected Republican present in the House chamber on Thursday. Most Senate Republicans issued statements and instead traveled to Atlanta to attend a memorial service for a former colleague. House Republicans remained largely silent. “The future of the country is at stake, and there are moments when we all have to come together in order to defend the Constitution,” Ms. Cheney told reporters as she left the chamber. Her father joined her on the House floor, as top Democrats — many of whom regarded him as a detested foe when he served under President George W. Bush — lined up to shake his hand and greet him warmly. “It’s not a leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for 10 years,” Mr. Cheney said, when asked about top Republicans and their response to the riot. Asked about how they have treated his daughter, he replied, “My daughter can take care of herself.” Senators spent much of the day on Thursday recounting their experiences on Jan. 6, a series of speeches on the Senate floor that conjured up memories of the violent storming of the Capitol that sent lawmakers fleeing for their lives. Before asking for a moment of silence to honor those who protected the Capitol, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, spoke about his own close encounter with the mob. He recalled how an officer grabbed him by the collar to lead him to safety, only moments before rioters reached the Senate floor. “I’ll never forget that grip. And he said to me, ‘Senator, we got to get out of here, you’re in danger,’” Mr. Schumer recalled. As they rushed through the halls, Mr. Schumer had to quickly change course. “I was within 30 feet of these nasty, racist, bigoted insurrectionists,” he said. “Had someone had a gun, had two of them blocked off the door, who knows what would have happened. I was told later that one of them reportedly said, ‘There’s the big Jew. Let’s get him.’” No Republicans attended the session, which was devoted to remembrances of the riot a year ago. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota and chairwoman of the Rules Committee, recalled the quick thinking of congressional aides who whisked the chests carrying electoral votes out of the chamber before the mob could seize them. “As I stand here, I look at the faces of the staff, I remember the moment when we were pushed out of this chamber for security reasons,” Ms. Klobuchar said. “I remember the words of one staff member who yelled out, ‘Take the boxes. Take the boxes.’ She was talking about the mahogany boxes that were filled with the electoral ballots, because we knew they would be destroyed if they were left behind.” Later, that decision would allow Republican and Democratic leaders, working together, to return to the Capitol and complete the counting of electoral votes, preserving the peaceful transfer of power. “I remember when the leaders — Senator McConnell, myself, Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy — were sent off to the secret place,” Senator Schumer said, referring to a secure location where congressional leaders are taken in emergencies. “We convened, after desperately trying to get the president on the phone to ask him to call the rioters off.” “We spoke to the secretary of defense and the acting attorney general, but to no avail,” Mr. Schumer continued. “But then the four of us got together and said, ‘We’re going to come back. We’re going to count those votes. We’re not going to let the violent insurrectionists stop us.’ And count the votes we did.” The House held a moment of silence on Thursday to acknowledge the Jan. 6 riot and the lives lost from that day, as lawmakers marked the anniversary in the chamber where a year ago they had barricaded themselves after a mob forced its way into the Capitol. With the House formally out of session for the day, there would ordinarily have been a quick flash of activity with mostly staff and one or two lawmakers present. Instead, more than three dozen lawmakers filed into the chamber for a moment of silence and a statement from Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “The sacred space where members legislate, children learn, visitors are welcomed, was defiled and damaged — we know that,” Ms. Pelosi said. “The assault did not deter us from our duty.” Those present included Representative Jim McGovern, the Massachusetts Democrat who took over presiding when Ms. Pelosi was evacuated from the chamber, as well as members of the so-called Gallery Group, the lawmakers who sheltered in the visitors’ gallery. During the chaos of the riot last year, Chaplain Margaret Grun Kibben, sworn in just days earlier, stood up to offer a prayer as lawmakers scrambled to flee. On Thursday, she offered a different prayer, for a revival of “our shared commitment to this country’s highest ideals, its strength in its diversity, its power in its defense of the common good.” “Hear our prayers for our Congress, for our nation, for its people,” she said. “As compatriots we are too often separated by politics and perspectives, individual certainties and intractable opinions.” Just one elected Republican was present: Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming. She is one of the few Republicans to condemn the attack and her party’s embrace of the stolen-election lies leading up to the riot. She was accompanied by her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, himself a former House member. The Senate held a similar moment of silence on the other side of the building. Ms. Pelosi also held a private moment on the House floor for lawmakers, staff, institutional workers, police officers and reporters to reflect on the day. It is rare for anyone other than lawmakers and select floor staff to participate in such a personal moment that way, underscoring how deeply the events affected not only those who were there last Jan. 6, but those who helped clean up the damage and steer the institution back to some form of normalcy. “As we acknowledge the horror of that day, we honor the heroism of so many, particularly U.S. Capitol Police, institutional staff, floor leadership, committee and member staff,” Ms. Pelosi said, speaking during the noon session. Over the last year, a furious array of rumor, innuendo, partial facts and outright lies have filled right-wing media with alternative narratives of the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, the first interruption in the peaceful transfer of power in American history. It has become an article of faith among vast swaths of conservative Americans that the riot was just “one day in January,” in the words of former Vice President Mike Pence, whose life was directly threatened. For the half of Republicans who now believe the rioters were at the Capitol to “protect democracy,” according to the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll, any talk of Jan. 6 as a singularly violent episode would likely be taken as liberal, mainstream-media claptrap. The reimagining of Jan. 6 has not so much evolved as it has splintered into rival, but often complementary, false narratives with a common goal — to shift blame away from former President Donald J. Trump, his supporters and a Republican Party maneuvering to win back control of government. The riot was a “false flag” operation by antifa, the loose left-wing collective; the F.B.I. planted agents to stir up the crowd; the protesters were mere “tourists” wrongfully accused by a Democratic-led Justice Department and vilified by a biased mainstream media; police officers recounting their injuries and trauma were “crisis actors.” “From the very first day — a year now — CNN and Politico and The Atlantic and all the airhead news anchors have been calling Jan. 6 an ‘insurrection,’” Tucker Carlson, the highest-rated host on cable TV and a leading proponent of Jan. 6 revisionism, told his Fox News viewers on Monday. “To us in literal America, that’s been confusing — because it wasn’t an insurrection. It was a lot of things. It was not an insurrection. No evidence of that.” According to a review by The New York Times of recent posts from right-wing groups on sites including Facebook, Twitter, Gab and Gettr, online chatter about celebrations and rallies for the anniversary of the Capitol riot has grown in recent weeks, but the posts have not attracted much buzz and appear unlikely to translate into sizable real-world efforts on Thursday. In the posts, there has been little talk of violence and guns. The groups have mostly focused on positioning the rioters as heroes and martyrs and encouraged people to push local political leaders toward a far-right agenda. They have also called on supporters to think of long-term goals such as stopping mask and vaccine mandates. Efforts to organize an anniversary protest in Washington on Thursday have also appeared to gain little traction online, according to The Times’s review. “Stay out of Washington, it is nothing but a setup,” wrote an Ohio member of the Proud Boys on Telegram on Monday. “Federal agents are going to be there in disguise waiting to arrest anyone who shows up.” The Capitol’s historic Statuary Hall, where Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Representative Elijah Cummings laid in honor after their deaths, was transformed on Thursday into the backdrop for a slick television set, constructed for a prime-time CNN special covering the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack. The large black circular stage, surrounded with bright lights, a camera crane and Teleprompters, was an unusual sight inside the marble-floored expanse just off the House floor, which displays statues from states around the country. President Biden and Vice President Harris began the day speaking from the stage. The set was built with the approval of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who will be featured in the program along with other members of Congress, including Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming and the vice chair of the special committee investigating the attack, and other members of the panel. Also appearing will be several police officers who helped fight off the mob. The appearance of the stage inside the Capitol prompted grumbling by Republicans, who privately complained that Democrats who control Congress were turning the Jan. 6 anniversary into an over-the-top spectacle. Republicans were notably silent and absent from the remembrances on Thursday, as Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris marked the day with speeches and Democrats took turns sharing their recollections of the harrowing day the Capitol came under attack with them inside. “We are not interested in propriety lessons from congressional Republicans who have fanned the flames that led to the insurrection in the first place,” said Drew Hammill, Ms. Pelosi’s spokesman. Statuary Hall is the old home of the House of Representatives, where Marquis de Lafayette became the first foreign citizen to address Congress and Presidents James Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson and Millard Fillmore were inaugurated. It was built after invading British troops burned the U.S. Capitol in 1814. It has since been renamed National Statuary Hall, and Congress has invited states to contribute statues of prominent citizens for display in the room."

Zhang Shengzi, a 24-year-old student, said the smell is so pungent she has to wait some time after they’ve gone before she will open her door again. She can barely leave her room, let alone campus, and all her classes are online. Ms. Zhang’s university, like the rest of Xi’an, has been under a citywide lockdown since Dec. 22. It is the longest lockdown in China since the first one in Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak began almost two years ago. In scenes recalling the early days of the pandemic, hungry residents have traded coffee for eggs and cigarettes for instant noodles. A pregnant woman and an 8-year-old boy suffering from leukemia are among those who have been denied medical care. People in need of lifesaving medications have struggled to obtain them. China’s ability to control the virus has come a long way since the pandemic started: It has inoculated nearly 1.2 billion people and set up a nationwide electronic health database for contact tracing. Yet it has continued to rely on the same authoritarian virus-fighting methods from early 2020, including strict quarantines, border closings and lockdowns. These have led to food and medical shortages and growing questions about how much longer its zero-Covid strategy, the last in the world, can continue. Despite the frustration, the authorities in Xi’an on Wednesday declared the city’s battle with the virus a victory. Fourteen days into the lockdown, city officials said that Xi’an had achieved “zero Covid on a societal level,” though its 13 million residents remained unable to leave home. “The district security guards are like prison guards and we are like prisoners,” said Tom Zhao, a Xi’an resident. Mr. Zhao, 38, said he had joined dozens of chat groups last week searching for anyone who could help him find medicine for his mother, who has early-stage diabetes. Even big multinational companies in the city have been affected. Two of the world’s largest memory chip makers, Samsung and Micron, said they have had to adjust operations at their manufacturing bases in Xi’an because of the restrictions, potentially roiling the already fragile global supply chain. Xi’an has reported 1,800 cases in its latest outbreak, stunningly low compared with the daily case count in the United States. And as the world struggles to contain the spread of Omicron, in China officials have reported only a few local cases of the variant, and none in Xi’an. The authorities are nevertheless worried, in a country that has stridently stuck by its zero-Covid policy — and held up its success fighting the virus as proof that its authoritarian style of leadership saves lives. The Beijing Winter Olympics and the Lunar New Year holiday are a few weeks away, and China’s vaccines appear to be less effective than their Western competitors, particularly against variants. The country has yet to approve mRNA technology for its vaccines, and while booster shots are now widely available, their takeup in the country has been slower than the initial jabs. “The Xi’an epidemic is the most serious after Wuhan was shut down,” said Zeng Guang, a Chinese epidemiologist who visited Wuhan in the early days of the pandemic and was quoted in state media on Wednesday. “People across the country should give Xi’an a lot of support, hoping that Xi’an will accumulate new experience in epidemic prevention.” So far, the experiences have been grim. Tens of thousands of people have been relocated to centralized quarantine facilities to stop the spread. Several top city officials have been fired, and the head of Xian’s big data bureau was suspended. On Tuesday, the vast health code system used to track people and enforce quarantines and lockdowns crashed because it couldn’t handle the traffic, making it hard for residents to access public hospitals or complete daily routines like regular Covid testing. Many were incensed when a woman in the city, eight months pregnant, lost her baby after she was made to wait for hours at a hospital because she was unable to prove she did not have Covid-19. (The authorities responded by firing officials and requesting an apology from the hospital.) Days into the lockdown, residents began to post on social media about how hard it was to get groceries or order food. After being reassured by officials that it was unnecessary to stock up, residents across the city were caught off guard when an initial policy allowing one member of each household to leave every two days was eliminated. Officials later acknowledged the mistake and quickly posted images of volunteers delivering groceries. But by then, residents were already complaining online that officials had put the pursuit of eliminating the outbreak above the well-being of citizens. Mr. Zhao, who moved in with his parents ahead of the lockdown to help take care of them, watched as their neighbors bartered for food. Several days ago, officials came in trucks to deliver vegetables, announcing their arrival on loudspeaker. Mr. Zhao and his parents received two plastic bags: a white radish, a head of cabbage, three potatoes, a carrot and two zucchinis. They fared much better than others. Mr. Zhao said a friend who lived in a different district didn’t get any food, and that another told him that her building elevator was turned off except for one hour a day when residents were allowed to do compulsory testing and walk their pets. As the situation worsened across the city, people posted videos and heartfelt appeals for help. “SOS,” wrote one resident whose father could not get medical care when he suffered a heart attack. He later died, according to a post from his daughter, who shared the story on Weibo, a major social media platform in China. Zhao Zheng, the father of an 8-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, found himself battling with staff at several hospitals in Xi’an after his son’s Dec. 28 appointment was canceled. Each hospital asked for proof that he was no longer in quarantine and documentation that Mr. Zhao and his family had not recently been exposed to the virus. “Nobody could issue this document for us at all,” said Mr. Zhao, 43, who until recently had owned a small construction company. Eventually, with the help of local reporters, Mr. Zhao and his wife were able to find a hospital on Jan. 2; their son is now undergoing weekly treatment. Amid the outcry, the government this week created special “green channels” for pregnant women and patients with “acute and critical illnesses” to get medical care more easily.  By Thursday, top officials moved further to try to douse public anger. Liu Shunzhi, the head of the city’s health commission, apologized for the stillbirth and for wider problems during the lockdown. Sun Chunlan, a vice premier overseeing the central government’s efforts to contain Covid, ordered local health authorities to ensure there was no repeat of deadly delays in hospital treatment.  “It’s extremely painful that problems like this have occurred and we feel deep remorse,” said Ms. Sun, according to Chinese state media. “This has revealed sloppiness in prevention and control efforts, and the lessons are profound.” To critics, the pain, suffering and confusion caused by the lockdown has made Beijing’s virus strategy appear increasingly unsustainable. “In this world, nobody is an island,” wrote Zhang Wenmin, a former investigative journalist who lives in Xi’an. Ms. Zhang, better known by her pen name Jiang Xue, published an account of her first 10 days in lockdown on social media. “The death of any individual is a death of all,” she wrote."
6,The New York Times,nytimes,"Xi’an, a city of 13 million people, has been under lockdown since Dec. 22, the longest in China since the first lockdown in Wuhan.",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3zvqdgi%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1JZkiyM7t4_eSVcHaIeyHKBcv-J3tm1MfeNcGmh33LK8-EOImLOOw4-n8&h=AT2WtMoVfV434Hg_eWv6KoPwfb0xNMq5fxWwSK30TPTw_M0eiNtQUe_xDoqkCupC5Nt0wepFTjIVvPtdgHB2OTGnqXh_NuSq5QxImobkhmAMHnzwn6JL7KLw10DpQpjCk9Z-sPO98KNI5fugMMDP&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT0W13gld5qv4nUNKEL7DoGAJNzqMQBb3weRRyxVxjqebpZ284sd7VBuTYWHzBlL8qJV-Gr2pg3f-Quty-Y0EbFQVEbITquIgZt1RMmZkZbegF8-ZvFdLi6Dm3Wk0BlNmp7Vjv1W3RAERS4DQUx6YxsQhMbV9g5dmxoe3R5pj-jqyE2z,18h,"A small, new real-world study suggests that two widely used at-home antigen tests, the Abbott BinaxNOW and Quidel QuickVue, may fail to detect some Omicron infections even when people are carrying high levels of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, focused on 30 people infected with the virus at five workplaces that experienced what were most likely outbreaks of the Omicron variant in December. The people received both saliva-based P.C.R. tests and rapid antigen tests using nasal swabs. It took three days, on average, for people to test positive on a rapid antigen test after their first positive P.C.R. result. In four cases, people transmitted the virus to others while the rapid test showed the negative result, according to the study, which was conducted by several members of the Covid-19 Sports and Society Working Group. It is not clear whether the infections were missed because the antigen tests are inherently less sensitive to Omicron or because saliva tests may be better at detecting the new variant. But the results are consistent with other preliminary evidence that the at-home tests that many Americans have come to rely on — at least as currently administered, with a nasal swab — may fail to detect some Omicron cases in the first days of infection. The researchers said they shared their results with federal officials — including at the White House, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — in real-time, as the outbreaks were occurring last month. “They’re aware that there are flaws with antigen testing,” said Dr. Robby Sikka, an author of the study and chair of the working group. The study comes a week after the Food and Drug Administration released its own update on the effectiveness of the rapid antigen tests. “Early data suggests that antigen tests do detect the Omicron variant but may have reduced sensitivity,” the agency said. Many of the studies are early and small, and much more data is needed. The tests, which can deliver results at home in minutes, remain an important public health tool, and positive results are especially likely to be informative, many scientists said. (The wait for P.C.R. results can stretch for days.) “The message is not that we should stop using these tests,” said Isabella Eckerle, a clinical virologist at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. But people should be cautious about interpreting negative results, especially when they have symptoms or believe they may have been exposed to the virus. “It’s not a ticket that allows you to go back to normal or to drop any other measures,” Dr. Eckerle said. Antigen tests are designed to detect proteins on the surface of the coronavirus. If mutations in the virus change the structure of these proteins, antigen tests might fail to detect the variant. The Omicron variant has about 50 mutations, including more than 30 on the spike protein alone. Most rapid antigen tests are designed to detect more stable targets, which are far less mutated in Omicron. Still, even minor-seeming mutations can affect a virus’s surface proteins, “sometimes in non-obvious ways,” said John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine. “Only experimental data can determine whether there is an impact or not.” The F.D.A. in September told makers of rapid tests that they would be required to continue to test their products as new variants emerged, and, if asked, to share those results with the agency. Many companies have announced that their tests can detect Omicron, and several independent scientists said that they believed the tests should be capable of recognizing the variant, especially when present at high levels. But a few new studies raise questions about the tests’ sensitivity. The F.D.A.’s update stemmed from an evaluation it is doing with the National Institutes of Health, said Bruce Tromberg, director of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering. The scientists evaluated the antigen tests using pooled samples of nasal mucus collected from multiple people with Omicron, as well as similar pooled samples from Delta patients. Scientists then diluted each of these pooled samples until the antigen tests no longer detected the virus. The tests were able to detect more dilute solutions of Delta samples than Omicron samples, suggesting that the tests may be less sensitive to the new variant, Dr. Tromberg said. Still, he added, in real-world settings, “it may not translate into any different sensitivity.” An F.D.A. spokeswoman, Stephanie Caccomo, said last week that studies were underway “to confirm the reason for the apparent decreased sensitivity.”“Once that is known,” she said, “adjustments to existing tests can be undertaken by each developer with support from the F.D.A., if appropriate.” The F.D.A. update was not the first hint that some antigen tests may be less sensitive to Omicron. Dr. Eckerle and her colleagues recently evaluated the performance of seven antigen tests against samples of the virus grown from specimens taken from people infected with Omicron. Overall, the researchers found, the tests were less sensitive to Omicron than to previous variants. “They missed samples with infectious virus, and they missed samples that had quite a decent viral load,” Dr. Eckerle said. The work has not yet been published in a scientific journal. But there was also vast variability in the performance of the different tests, most of which are not available in the United States. And an Australian study, which examined a mostly different collection of antigen tests, found that the tests had a similar sensitivity to Omicron and Delta. More data are needed, experts said. “Each test is going to have to be evaluated independently any time there’s a new variant,” said David O’Connor, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison who urged people not to stop using rapid tests. “And that takes some time.” The new study focused on five New York and California workplaces that had virus outbreaks in December. In 29 of 30 people, samples of the virus produced a telltale genetic pattern on P.C.R. tests, suggesting that these individuals were most likely infected with Omicron. Each participant took P.C.R. and antigen tests daily over a period of up to 10 days. The discordant results overwhelmingly came during the first three days of infection. “A negative result may not actually be a negative result,” said Anne Wyllie, a microbiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and an author of the new study. “People should not ignore high risk exposures. They should not ignore symptoms.” The study’s other authors are Blythe Adamson, the founder of Infectious Economics, a public health consulting company, and Dr. Prem Premsrirut, the chief executive of Mirimus Laboratories, which offers saliva-based P.C.R. testing. An Abbott spokesman, John Koval, said on Wednesday that the finding that a P.C.R. test is more sensitive is “not new.” “Due to immediate turnaround time, frequent rapid antigen testing does slow transmission — and with a highly infectious variant frequent testing is needed, which is not realistic with P.C.R.,” he wrote in an email. Quidel’s president, Douglas Bryant, said in a statement that the company performed recent testing using samples from South Africa and confirmed that its rapid tests are detecting the Omicron variant. A company spokesperson also said that it was not surprising that saliva-based P.C.R. tests detected the virus before nasal swabs did, if the study accurately concluded that viral load peaks first in saliva. The company noted that its rapid tests only have F.D.A. clearance to collect nasal swab specimens. In a smaller analysis, of five participants who took both nasal and saliva-based P.C.R. tests, the researchers found that the levels of virus peaked in saliva samples a day or two before they peaked in samples collected from the nose. Those findings are consistent with a recent report from South Africa, which has not yet been reviewed by experts. The researchers found that P.C.R. tests picked up a higher share of Omicron infections when saliva samples — produced by the rubbing of a swab inside the cheeks, around the gums and tongue — were used instead of nasal samples. The reverse was true for Delta. “Ideally, until we can directly compare the relative sensitivity of the antigen tests, my suggestion would be to test both sites,” Diana Hardie, a clinical virologist at the University of Cape Town, who led the research, said in an email. One possible explanation for the findings is that Omicron replicates faster or earlier in the throat and mouth than in the nose. “While we’ll have to wait to see if the science bears out, that might be an indicator that that’s where the virus is growing first,” said Gigi Gronvall, an immunologist and testing expert at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “So if you’re going to look for the virus, which is what the tests do, then you may find more of it faster in the throat swab over the nose.” Anecdotal reports have also emerged that some people who tested negative on antigen tests when they swabbed inside their noses received a positive result when they instead swabbed the back of their throats. “There’s a lot of chatter around this,” said Nathan Grubaugh, a virologist at the Yale School of Public Health. “Obviously, that warrants further investigation.” Some tests available in Britain call for swabbing both the nose and the throat, but the antigen tests available in the United States are not authorized for the collection of saliva or samples from the throat. Omicron’s rapid replication also means that there is a narrower window to catch the virus before it begins spreading, and that people may need to test themselves sooner after a potential exposure and as close as possible to an upcoming gathering or event, experts said. They may also need to test themselves more frequently overall, a particular challenge when the tests are in short supply. People who may have been exposed to the virus should take at least two antigen tests over the course of about two days, experts said."

The third 100 million came even faster, in barely five months, as large segments of countries, rich and poor alike, remain unvaccinated and a fast-spreading new variant has proved able to infect even those who are. Case counts, though imperfect, have been a key barometer throughout the pandemic, a benchmark not only for governments implementing mitigation measures but also for people trying to discern the threat in their own communities. Yet surpassing 300 million known cases — a milestone that was reached on Thursday, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University — comes as a growing number of experts argue that it is time to stop focusing on case numbers. So far, the new Omicron variant appears to produce severe illness in fewer people than previous versions of the virus did, and research indicates that Covid vaccines still offer protection against the worst outcomes. And though cases are rising faster than ever — the United States, Australia, France and many other nations are seeing record surges — hospitalizations and deaths from Covid are increasing more slowly. But experts do worry that the sheer number of possible cases may still burden health care systems already strained by previous waves of infection.  This week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert, suggested that it was time to stop focusing on case counts. “As you get further on and the infections become less severe, it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations,” Dr. Fauci told ABC News on Sunday. About 60 percent of the world has received at least a single dose of a Covid vaccine, but nearly three-quarters of all the shots have been administered in the world’s wealthiest nations, leaving people in parts of Africa and Asia vulnerable. In the United States, cases are averaging a staggering 610,000 each day, a 227 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are rising at a slower rate, up 60 percent in the past two weeks, while deaths are up by 2 percent. In France, average daily cases have quadrupled to a record, while hospitalizations have risen by about 70 percent and deaths have doubled, according to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. The trend suggests that the grim cadence seen for the past two years — a wave of infections, followed by a matching surge of hospitalizations, then deaths — may have been altered, in large part because of the protection offered by vaccines. However, because of the way deaths lag cases, it will be weeks before the full effect of the current case surge is reflected in death counts. And because of the widening availability of at-home tests in the United States and Europe, official case numbers — which scientists have long argued are an undercount — may diverge more than ever from actual totals. Not all home tests are reported to authorities and many people may never get tested. Even before Omicron emerged, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that only one in four U.S. infections was reported. Case numbers “definitely mean less than they did” earlier in the pandemic, said Robert West, a professor of health psychology at University College London. “If we had this number of infections then, we’d have had an astronomical number of deaths.” Still, the known death toll remains devastating: more than 830,000 in the United States, 620,000 in Brazil, nearly half a million in India. In many developing nations with huge gaps in health data, the true number may never be known. And Omicron’s impact could be harsher among populations with less protection from vaccines. Some of the fastest increases in cases are occurring in African countries, which have the lowest vaccination rates. Less than a handful of the countries on the continent are on track to meet a World Health Organization goal of administering two doses to 70 percent of their populations, even as rich nations have offered a third. “Booster after booster in a small number of countries will not end a pandemic while billions remain completely unprotected,” the W.H.O. director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Thursday. What is clear, many experts say, is that the virus is likely to become endemic, something that the world will have to live with for years to come, like the flu — and that by the time the world records case 400 million, as it surely will, that statistic will mean even less than it does now. “I think when we had the first wave, a lot of people felt — not experts, but the public and many politicians felt — that if we could only weather the storm, we could come out the other side in the summer of 2020 and everything would be rosy,” Professor West said. “We know now that is never going to be true.” The Mayo Clinic, one of the top-rated health care systems in the United States, said it would dismiss about 1 percent of its employees after they failed to comply with the clinic’s Monday deadline for its vaccine program. Mayo said that about 700 workers would lose their jobs for not meeting the deadline, which required either having received one dose of a vaccine or not being overdue for a second dose. The company employs about 73,000 people. Mayo said it had granted a majority of medical and religious exemption requests. “The needs of the patient come first,” the health system said, citing scientific consensus that coronavirus vaccines are safe and effective. Nationwide, vaccine mandates have often pushed health care workers to receive shots ahead of a looming deadline. But there are usually determined holdouts who choose to lose their jobs instead of getting vaccinated. In October, Northwell Health, the largest health care provider in New York, announced that 1,400 employees — less than 2 percent of its staff — had to leave their jobs after refusing vaccines. Norwell employs more than 77,000 people. Now, during the surge of cases fueled by the Omicron variant, the terminations place a burden on already strained doctors and nurses. More than 100,000 Covid patients are hospitalized nationwide, and hospitalizations have increased 58 percent in the past 14 days, according to data from The New York Times. As patients fill wards, systems face staff shortages as workers test positive. Even before the highly contagious Omicron variant began circulating, health care workers were leaving their jobs, burned out after almost two years of working through the pandemic. The Mayo Clinic — a Minnesota-based hospital system with campuses in Arizona and Florida — left the door open for the employees to apply for future jobs and return if they chose to get vaccinated. But it stressed its standard of care in its statement. “While Mayo Clinic is saddened to lose valuable employees,” the health system said, “we need to take all steps necessary to keep our patients, work force, visitors and communities safe.” Thousands of police officers, firefighters, bus drivers and other public employees across the United States are off the job with what officials have said are record numbers of coronavirus cases, leaving officials scrambling to reassure residents that crucial services will continue. In Dallas, 204 of the roughly 2,100 total employees of the city’s fire and rescue department were in quarantine on Thursday because of positive coronavirus tests — the most since the beginning of the pandemic, according to Jason Evans, a department spokesman. He said that approximately one-quarter of the department’s total positive tests since March 2020 had taken place in the last two weeks. In New York City, on any given day this week, 21 percent of subway operators and conductors — about 1,300 people out of a work force of 6,300 — have been absent from work, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which attributes the jump in absenteeism to the virus. Service has been suspended on three of the system’s 22 subway lines and schedules reduced on many others. The mayor of Cincinnati recently declared a 60-day emergency to address what he described as a “public danger” posed by depleted public-safety staffing. Los Angeles city officials said at a news conference on Thursday that almost 300 firefighters were off duty because of the virus, the most the department had seen at any one time. As recently as mid-December, the figure was 24. The Los Angeles Police Department said it had 505 officers out as a result of the virus. “The Omicron variant has taken off like wildfire,” Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said at a news conference on Thursday. Officials said that the city had authorized extra overtime and had canceled leave for Fire Department employees to cover the absences. The mayor said the police and fire departments “have maintained staffing needed to keep Angelenos safe.” The recent strain on police, fire and other public agencies has intensified disputes over vaccination mandates. In Los Angeles, officials said thousands of police and fire employees had requested medical or religious exemptions to the city’s vaccine mandate. Some have since complied with the rules and gotten shots, but others are still in the midst of lengthy reviews. Some workers who did not get vaccinated by the deadline have been sent home without pay while they go through disciplinary processes. Mr. Garcetti said that about 83 percent of the city’s police officers and firefighters were in compliance with the vaccine mandate. He urged employees, and all city residents, to get booster shots as well. In San Francisco, where rates of new coronavirus case reports are at their highest since the start of the pandemic, public health officials have urged residents to “layer their defenses” by getting booster shots and wearing masks, in part to help ensure that 911 calls are answered quickly and buses and trains run on time. “San Francisco is in a relatively good position, compared to other municipalities,” the city’s director of health, Dr. Grant Colfax, said in a statement. “But the Omicron variant is challenging us, even more than Delta, to manage this disease while keeping our economy, schools and other essential services open.” Jeff Cretan, spokesman for Mayor London Breed, said on Thursday that 140 Fire Department employees and 188 Police Department employees had tested positive or were out because of quarantine protocols; so were 110 workers at the city’s transit agency. Mr. Cretan said that having all of the city’s frontline workers be fully vaccinated had staved off worse trouble. “People aren’t getting sick and ending up in the hospital and dying from our work force,” he said. On the day President Biden was inaugurated, the advisory board of health experts who counseled him during his transition officially ceased to exist. But its members have quietly continued to meet regularly over Zoom, their conversations often turning to frustration with Mr. Biden’s coronavirus response. Now, six of these former advisers have gone public with an extraordinary, albeit polite, critique — and a plea to be heard. In three opinion articles published on Thursday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, they called for Mr. Biden to adopt an entirely new domestic pandemic strategy geared to the “new normal” of living with the virus indefinitely, not to wiping it out. The authors are all big names in American medicine. Several, including Dr. Luciana Borio, a former acting chief scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, and Dr. David Michaels, a former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration now with George Washington University’s School of Public Health, have held high-ranking government positions. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist, medical ethicist and University of Pennsylvania professor who advised former President Barack Obama, organized the effort. Like any White House, Mr. Biden’s prizes loyalty and prefers to keep its differences in house; in that regard, the articles are an unusual step. The authors say they wrote them partly because they have not made headway talking directly to White House officials. “From a macroperspective, it feels like we are always fighting yesterday’s crisis and not necessarily thinking what needs to be done today to prepare us for what comes next,” Dr. Borio said. The authors shared the articles with White House officials before they were published, but it was unclear whether the administration would adopt any of their suggestions. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, Mr. Biden’s top medical adviser for the pandemic, declined to comment on the articles. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters she had not read the articles, and dismissed a question about whether the president “is coming around to accepting” that Covid-19 is here to stay, even though several recent media accounts suggested that the administration was beginning to operate under that assumption. Mr. Biden’s recent emphasis on keeping schools open and businesses running even when cases are soaring also suggests a recalibration, as does a recent decision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend that people with Covid isolate for five days instead of 10. SEOUL — North Korea said on Friday that it would not participate in the Beijing Winter Olympics because of the coronavirus pandemic and moves by “hostile forces.” Its no-show at the Beijing ​Games would deprive South Korea of a rare opportunity to establish official contact with the ​North. Officials from the South had hoped that the ​Olympics would provide a venue for​ official delegates from both Koreas to meet to discuss issues beyond sports. In a letter hand-delivered on Wednesday to China by the North’s ambassador, the country’s Olympic Committee and its ministry of sports wished Beijing a successful Games even though “the U.S. and its vassal forces are getting evermore undisguised in their moves against China aimed at preventing the successful opening of the Olympics,” according to the North’s official Korean Central News Agency on Friday. The letter added that although North Korea “could not take part in the Olympics due to the hostile forces’ moves and the worldwide pandemic,” it “would fully support the Chinese comrades in all their work to hold a splendid and wonderful Olympic festival.” North Korea has maintained some of the world’s toughest restrictions to guard against the spread of the virus. It has rejected outside aid and shut its borders, reportedly placing its guards there under “shoot to kill” orders. The country has claimed no Covid-19 cases, and it has rejected offers of millions of vaccine doses, leaving its population vulnerable to explosive outbreaks should its borders reopen. The pandemic has deepened the North’s diplomatic isolation and economic difficulties. ​On Wednesday, it launched what it called a hypersonic missile. Gov. Jim Justice of West Virginia said he would ask the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for authorization to begin offering fourth doses of a coronavirus vaccine to residents. At a news conference, Mr. Justice, a Republican, said he wanted to start offering fourth doses to people 50 and older, as well as to essential workers, which would make West Virginia the first state to do so. “We’re going to end up with a run on our hospitals like you can’t imagine,” Mr. Justice said, pointing to the highly contagious Omicron variant. Mr. Justice pointed to Israel, one of the first countries to broadly offer a fourth dose to its older citizens, and cited preliminary data from Israel that suggests immunity wanes a few months after a booster shot. Some experts, however, have warned that a fourth shot may be premature. In interviews this week with The New York Times, nearly a dozen scientists said that trying to boost the entire population every few months is not realistic. Nor does it make much scientific sense. Still, the idea may be gaining popularity. Chile said Thursday that it would begin offering fourth shots to immunocompromised citizens next week, Reuters reported, making it the first country in Latin America to do so. But extra shots still lag in the U.S. So far just over a third of American adults have opted for a booster. There are no data to support the effectiveness of a fourth dose of the current vaccines, but cases are rising swiftly and data on fourth doses is coming. “In the midst of this epidemic, the Omicron epidemic, we need to respond swiftly and we need to assess the data,” said Dr. Jorge Salinas, a hospital epidemiologist at Stanford. “If the data is convincing, I think it could be reasonable for certain populations.” In early 2021, West Virginia had one of the highest vaccination rates in the country. Residents are among America’s oldest and least healthy, and officials had partnered with a network of pharmacies and about 200 long-term care facilities to deliver first doses. The state finished its first round of vaccinations at nursing homes in late January, when many other states were just getting started. West Virginia got a jump on delivering nursing home residents their second shots, too. But after the notably rapid start, the state now lags in vaccinations. About 55 percent of people in West Virginia are fully vaccinated, below the national average of 62 percent, according to data from The New York Times. Mr. Justice said that he had anticipated vaccine holdouts, and said he would continue to push for more shots. Dr. Clay Marsh, the official running the state’s coronavirus response, noted that the most vulnerable people, like those who live in nursing homes, had received their vaccines first. Citing the data from Israel, he said their protection may be waning. “We can’t afford in West Virginia to have our most vulnerable get sick with Covid-19,” Dr. Marsh said. Mr. Justice said the federal government had bungled the pandemic response, and suggested that individual states take control. “We’ve got to do something,” Mr. Justice said. “Either we sit back and just let our people die, and we sit back and let our hospitals be overrun, or we try.” James Corden joined the ranks of late-night TV hosts who have recently tested positive for the coronavirus, disclosing his diagnosis on Thursday as tapings of his CBS program, “The Late Late Show,” were halted for the next several days. Corden said in a social media post on Thursday, “I just tested positive for covid 19. I’m fully vaccinated, boosted and because of this am fortunate enough to say I feel completely fine. The show will be off the air for the next few days. Stay safe everyone. All my love, James x.” A programming schedule released by CBS on Thursday indicated that “The Late Late Show,” which is recorded in Los Angeles, would air repeat broadcasts starting Thursday night and running through Jan. 17. Corden’s announcement came two days after Seth Meyers, the host of NBC’s “Late Night,” said that he had tested positive and halted tapings of his show. Jimmy Fallon, the host of “The Tonight Show” on NBC, said that he had tested positive for coronavirus during a holiday break, but he has returned to the program this week. Ian Karmel, a head writer for “The Late Late Show,” joked about Corden in a Twitter post on Thursday: “I told him it was hacky to do this after Fallon and Seth both did it, but whatever,” Karmel wrote. “Saturday Night Live,” which like “The Tonight Show” and “Late Night” is produced at NBC’s headquarters in New York, ran its 2021 year-end episode without a studio audience, a musical guest or many of its cast members amid concerns about Covid. NBC said on Thursday that “S.N.L.” would resume live episodes on Jan. 15. Stephen Colbert told his audience earlier this week that he intended to continue hosting CBS’s flagship “Late Show” from the stage of the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York for as long as possible. “It’s a privilege to do this show,” Colbert said on the program, “and if I do get it, I promise you, I will not be doing my show.” The Biden administration has largely responded to the near vertical rise in coronavirus cases by pushing for more people to get not only their initial doses of vaccine, but booster shots as well. This week, federal health officials endorsed boosters for youths 12 to 17 who had initially gotten the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The government also changed the definition of “up to date” Covid vaccination to include boosters. But even as the United States has moved rapidly to expand who is eligible for boosters, progress in persuading Covid-fatigued Americans to get them has stalled. About 62 percent of Americans — about 206 million people — are fully vaccinated, according to federal data. But according to a C.D.C. database, only about 35 percent of Americans have received a booster since mid-August, when additional shots were first authorized, even as eligibility has greatly expanded. On Nov. 19, the F.D.A. authorized boosters for everyone 18 and older who had received two doses of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, and on Dec. 9, it authorized boosters of the Pfizer vaccine for 16- and 17-year-olds. Those changes led to more Americans getting boosters, according to the federal database, but that has since leveled off. After the discovery of the Omicron variant in late November, the pace of all vaccinations sped up, but it peaked in early December, and then it plateaued. (Reporting lags around the Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s holidays have affected the daily numbers throughout this period.) Omicron, which is highly transmissible, has shown that it is better at evading vaccines than other variants. But scientists say booster shots can offer substantial protection, especially against severe disease. The United States is averaging a staggering 585,000 cases a day, a record and a 247 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are rising more slowly, up 53 percent in the past two weeks, and a smaller percentage of patients are landing in intensive care units or requiring mechanical ventilation, compared with those in previous waves. Deaths are down by 3 percent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention went even further in encouraging booster shots on Wednesday, when health officials recommended that to remain up to date, people should get three doses of Pfizer’s or Moderna’s vaccines. The agency also recommended that recipients of Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose vaccine receive a second dose, preferably of Moderna’s or Pfizer’s. “There really isn’t debate here in what people should do,” the C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, said in an interview on Tuesday. “If they’re eligible for a boost, they should get boosted.” Still, the expansion of booster shot eligibility has not been met with an equal amount of demand. Dr. Rebekah E. Gee, the former health secretary of Louisiana, chalked up the resistance to boosters to pandemic fatigue. Referring to the pandemic’s many problems, Dr. Gee said some people simply “don’t want this to be there” and are trying to “will it out of existence.” Shortly after coronavirus vaccines were rolled out about a year ago, women started reporting erratic menstrual cycles after receiving the shots. Some said their periods were late. Others reported heavier bleeding than usual or painful bleeding.  A study published on Thursday found that women’s menstrual cycles did indeed change following vaccination against the coronavirus. The authors reported that women who were inoculated had slightly longer menstrual cycles after receiving the vaccine than those who were not vaccinated. Their periods themselves, which came almost a day later on average, were not prolonged, however, and the effect was transient, with cycle lengths bouncing back to normal within one or two months.  The study, in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, is one of the first to support anecdotal reports from women that their menstrual cycles were off after vaccination, said Dr. Hugh Taylor, the chair of the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at Yale School of Medicine. “It validates that there is something real here,” said Dr. Taylor, who has heard about irregular cycles from his own patients. At the same time, he added, the changes seen in the study were not significant and appeared to be transient. “I want to make sure we dissuade people from those untrue myths out there about fertility effects,” Dr. Taylor said. “A cycle or two where periods are thrown off may be annoying, but it’s not going to be harmful in a medical way.” It’s not clear why the menstrual cycle might be affected by vaccination, but most women with regular periods experience an occasional unusual cycle or missed period. Hormones secreted by the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland and the ovaries regulate the monthly cycle, and they can be affected by environmental factors, stressors and life changes. (The changes observed in the study were not caused by pandemic-related conditions, the authors said, since women in the unvaccinated group were also living in the pandemic.) Novak Djokovic, the top player in men’s tennis and its leading vaccine skeptic, was stopped at the border in Melbourne late Wednesday after flying from Dubai to defend his Australian Open title. State government and Australian tennis officials had granted Mr. Djokovic an exemption from Covid vaccination rules that would allow him to compete in the event. But upon his arrival, federal border officials said that Mr. Djokovic did not meet the country’s requirements for entry because he was unvaccinated, and they canceled his visa. He filed a legal appeal on Thursday. The exemption had stirred anger in Australia, which has enforced tough rules to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and has maintained one of the world’s lowest Covid death rates. Citizens who endured long lockdowns, and for months faced strict limits on leaving or returning to the country, demanded to know if Mr. Djokovic had been given special treatment. Mr. Djokovic’s limbo appears to be rooted in confusion over the exemption granted by Australian tennis officials and local authorities in Victoria, the state where the tournament is held. The exemption was believed to have been approved because of Mr. Djokovic’s previous coronavirus infections — grounds that federal officials had warned were invalid. As a dizzying surge in coronavirus cases spurred by the fast-spreading Omicron variant has disrupted life in New York City and undermined its economic recovery, its subway system — the nation’s largest — has confronted a staggering worker shortage that has hampered its ability to keep trains running. On any given day this week, 21 percent of subway operators and conductors — about 1,300 people out of a work force of 6,300 — have been absent from work, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the city’s subways, buses and two commuter-rail lines. The soaring jump in absenteeism, which the transportation authority attributes to the virus, has meant a lack of workers to keep up with the regular train schedules, leading officials to suspend service this week on three of the system’s 22 subway lines and reduce schedules on many others, leading to longer wait times. The unraveling of train schedules is the latest hit to a transit network that has been battered by the pandemic, which has killed more than 150 workers and chased away millions of daily riders and the fares they pay, inflicting a brutal financial blow that threatens the system’s future. The worker shortage has not shut down service at any of the system’s 472 subway stations — all those on the suspended lines are served by other trains. But the disruptions have led to longer commutes and travel delays for riders, a major challenge for transit officials who were hoping to lure back more passengers at the start of the year. “I feel like it’s been bad since Christmas,” Jennifer Hall, 41, said Wednesday morning as she waited with her son for a D train in the Bronx. Portugal’s government said on Thursday it would loosen pandemic rules for people who have received a booster dose of the coronavirus vaccine, in order to encourage residents to maintain the country’s status as one of Europe’s most vaccinated. People who have received a booster will no longer be required to present a negative Covid test to attend events or enter sites where that is otherwise mandatory. People with booster shots will also no longer have to isolate themselves after coming in contact with a person diagnosed with the coronavirus, unless the infected person lives with them. People without booster shots will still be required to isolate after any contact. The new rules, announced by Prime Minister António Costa, will come into force on Monday. Portugal is relaxing its rules in part to forestall staff shortages and disruptions in workplaces and schools as it grapples with the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, which is better at bypassing vaccine protection than earlier virus variants were. Portugal mounted one of Europe’s most successful vaccination rollouts last year, and 89 percent of its population of about 10 million people has now been fully vaccinated, Mr. Costa said. About three million residents have also received a booster so far. Last month, as Omicron started to spread, Portugal reintroduced a battery of restrictions, including the closure of nightclubs and bars and a requirement for negative tests to enter hotels and restaurants. The government said on Thursday that bars and clubs could reopen on Jan. 14. Portugal reported 39,000 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, its highest daily since the appearance of Omicron. Mr. Costa noted that Omicron accounted for about 90 percent of the new cases, and that so far at least, they were not overwhelming hospitals. “Despite having many more cases, we thankfully have a much lower level of hospitalization” than a year ago, Mr. Costa said. As a result, he said, Portugal was in a “quiet situation” that allowed for the lifting of some restrictions “with caution.” Xi’an, a city of 13 million people, has been under a citywide lockdown since Dec. 22. It is the longest lockdown in China since the first one in Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak began almost two years ago. In scenes recalling the early days of the pandemic, hungry residents have traded coffee for eggs and cigarettes for instant noodles. A pregnant woman and an 8-year-old boy with leukemia are among those who have been denied medical care. People in need of lifesaving medications have struggled to obtain them. China’s ability to control the virus has come a long way since the pandemic started: The country has inoculated nearly 1.2 billion people and set up a nationwide electronic health database for contact tracing. Yet it has continued to rely on the same authoritarian virus-fighting methods from early 2020, including strict quarantines, border closings and lockdowns. These have led to food and medical shortages and growing questions about how much longer its zero-Covid strategy, the last in the world, can continue. Parents across Chicago raced to find child care on Wednesday morning after jarring news: Classes in the nation’s third-largest public school district were canceled. The teachers’ union and Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration had failed to agree on how to keep schools open during an Omicron-fueled virus surge. Across the country, the wildly contagious Omicron variant has infected millions and complicated the return to classrooms and workplaces. But nowhere has returning to school been more acrimonious and unpredictable than in Chicago, where, after two days back in classrooms following winter break, 73 percent of teachers voted to stop reporting to work. The city responded by calling off school altogether, refusing the teachers’ call for remote instruction. With no deal reached by Wednesday evening, district officials said classes would be canceled again on Thursday. The abrupt pause in the academic calendar, rooted in years of enmity between the Chicago Teachers Union and City Hall, jumbled plans for hundreds of thousands of students and posed another major test for Ms. Lightfoot, a Democrat whose tenure has been marked by labor strife, the pandemic and a surge in homicides. “If they are in class and Covid is rampaging, that’s a problem. If they are not there and out on the streets, that’s a problem,” said Tamar Manasseh, who leads an anti-violence group in the city, and who said she was looking into ways to help children with nowhere to go during the day. “This has put us in an untenable situation.” Ms. Lightfoot, whose disagreements with the Chicago Teachers Union date back to a strike in the early months of her term, said in an interview that the two sides remained far apart as negotiations continued. Ms. Lightfoot said she intended to take legal action against the union, and on Monday evening said the city had filed an unfair labor practices complaint. The school district opened buildings for meal distribution on Wednesday and published a list of places where parents could get emergency child care. “The consequences of the union acting like this time and time again are profound,” Ms. Lightfoot said. She added, “You think about the consequences for the families to be faced with the hostage choice of either going to work or taking care of their kids and home-schooling — no parent should be put in that position.” TOKYO — Japan asked the United States on Thursday to impose lockdowns on its military bases in the country as it tries to stanch a rapid climb in Covid infections linked in part to outbreaks among American service members. While Japan has not yet seen the kind of explosion in cases experienced by other countries grappling with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, daily case numbers passed 2,600 on Wednesday after remaining in the low hundreds through late December. “The government of Japan is deeply concerned about the spread of infections on Japanese and American military facilities and in the surrounding areas,” the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, told reporters. Japan’s foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, made the lockdown request to his American counterpart, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, during a phone call to discuss diplomatic issues, Mr. Matsuno said. It was unclear what steps the United States would take. The spread of the virus on American military bases in Japan has outpaced that in the country at large, and local authorities have linked outbreaks in their communities to contact among residents and U.S. personnel. Japan has largely closed its borders to foreigners since the beginning of the pandemic, and it further tightened restrictions soon after the first cases of Omicron were identified in southern Africa in November. Travelers to Japan must present a negative Covid test before departure. But American service members have been allowed to enter the country without testing, Mr. Matsuno told reporters in late December. The requirement was waived under the status of forces agreement that governs the large U.S. military presence in the country. On Thursday, the governor of Okinawa said he would ask the government to help prepare the prefecture to go onto an emergency footing as daily case counts approach 1,000. Cases there have increased significantly after an outbreak at one of the island’s American military bases. Another outbreak has been linked to the Marine Corps base in Iwakuni, southwest of Hiroshima. In response, local officials asked the facility to restrict the movement of its personnel in an effort to stem the transmission. A senior Hong Kong official was sent to quarantine after attending a birthday party with a person who later tested positive for the coronavirus, the government said on Thursday, fueling public scorn in a city facing the threat of a new wave of the pandemic. Hong Kong has largely managed to keep the coronavirus at bay, but health officials have warned that the Omicron variant could change that. Carrie Lam, the chief executive, announced a series of new restrictions on Wednesday, including a two-week ban on flights from eight countries, among them the United States. Mrs. Lam said Thursday that she was “disappointed” in the officials who attended the party on Monday, days after Hong Kong began reporting the local spread of Omicron cases. The first local cluster of the variant is believed to have started on Dec. 27, when a flight attendant for Cathay Pacific violated quarantine to dine out with family members. While Monday’s party did not break any current rules, it was a bad look at a time when the government has been urging extra caution. But Mrs. Lam dismissed comparisons between her and the management of Cathay Pacific, whom she had criticized for its staff’s rule violations. “If all you want is for me to say the chief executive should take responsibility for every matter and every action of the principal officials, this is not the duty of chief executive,” she said at a news conference. “All I can say is we are making an all-out effort in fighting the epidemic.” Ten senior government officials were among 100 people who attended Monday’s party, at a Spanish restaurant in the Wan Chai District of Hong Kong Island. They included the police chief, the immigration director and the head of the city’s anticorruption body. Eight of them are believed to have left before the person later confirmed to be infected arrived, Mrs. Lam said. Caspar Tsui, the secretary for home affairs, stayed longer and is considered a close contact of the positive case. He has been sent to a government-run quarantine center at Penny’s Bay, Mrs. Lam said. Mr. Tsui posted an apology on Facebook, saying that as an official, he “should be more vigilant and cautious to take action with epidemic prevention as the first consideration!” Comments on the post were filled with schadenfreude that a top official would have to face the same onerous quarantine that Hong Kong residents who travel abroad must undergo. One posted a 2020 headline quoting Mr. Tsui saying that punishments should be increased against rule-breakers who risked making the pandemic worse. WASHINGTON — President Biden came into office vowing to restore public trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after the Trump White House had tied the agency’s hands and manipulated its scientific judgments on the pandemic for political ends. Yet in his first year, Mr. Biden has presided over a series of messaging failures that have followed a familiar pattern, with the agency’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, and her team making what experts say are largely sound decisions, but fumbling in communicating them to America. Dr. Walensky, a highly regarded infectious disease expert from Boston with no prior government experience, insisted in February that schools must keep students six feet apart; in March, she said three feet was enough. She said in February that teachers did not need to be vaccinated to reopen schools; the White House said the next day that she was speaking “in her personal capacity.” In May, she said that vaccinated people generally did not need to wear masks in public, a sudden change that flummoxed state health officials. Two months later, she reversed that guidance after it was shown that vaccinated people could still transmit the coronavirus. More recently, with the Omicron variant driving a near vertical rise in cases, Dr. Walensky alerted the White House that she planned to recommend that people infected with the virus isolate for five days instead of 10. To avoid another messaging fiasco, she briefed other top Biden health officials on her proposal so they would all be on the same page, according to two people familiar with her actions. But both Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, and Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, the surgeon general, took issue on national television with the agency’s policy of not requiring a negative Covid test before ending the shorter isolation. Dr. Tom Frieden, the agency’s director under President Barack Obama, said he did not believe the latest recommendations on isolation were significantly wrong, but “the way they were released was very problematic.” The crux of the problem, several administration officials said, is a failure by the C.D.C. and the Biden administration’s messaging experts to work in concert. Dr. Walensky’s critics say she is not collaborative enough, too often springing decisions on other federal officials who then struggle to defend them in public. Her defenders say that she strives to coordinate, but that it is not her job to ensure consensus across the entire administration. Some suggest the White House has gone too far in its hands-off, let-the-scientists-rule approach, leaving a vacuum of leadership and forcing ad hoc coordination between the various public health agencies. There is vaccine hesitancy, but on the flip side, there is Brahmdeo Mandal. Mr. Mandal is so excited about the healing promise of a jab that he says he has received 12 coronavirus vaccine doses — so far. How, you may ask? Mr. Mandal, an 85-year-old retired postman from the northern Indian state of Bihar, is happy to share. He said he received his first dose on Feb. 13 at a local clinic, and he hasn’t stopped since. He has recorded the date and location of each jab in a pocket notebook. His ninth shot, he said, was on Sept. 24 at 12:32 p.m. at a hospital in Kalashan, Madhepura District. “I felt that it was helping my general health,” he said in a phone interview. “My backache has improved, my general weakness improved, and my appetite improved.” “I was always looking for new vaccine camps and would go there,” Mr. Mandal said. “Nobody would recognize me.” Dr. Amarendra Narayan Shahi, the chief medical officer in Madhepura, said he had spoken to Mr. Mandal who had told him about his quest to get more doses because he believed it cured his ailments, many of them natural at his age. “Yes, he is claiming that he got 12 doses,” Dr. Shahi said. “I have constituted a three-member investigating team to find the truth.” For nine of the 12 shots Mr. Mandal registered to receive, he said he used his national identity card and his mobile number. After that, he said, he switched to alternative forms of identification, like his voting card and the mobile numbers of his wife and his friends. Exactly how Mr. Mandal was found out is unclear, but it appeared to be a case of him boasting about his many boosters to someone who had then tipped off the local news media. Authorities in the district of Madhepura say they have also started an investigation. There is no indication that supercharging the immune system with 12 shots brings any real benefits, or would help with anything other than what the vaccine is intended to do. In fact, there is an ongoing debate on whether boosting the immune system over and over can cause it to become fatigued, or to prevent it from responding to future versions of the vaccine. Only an investigation will confirm whether Mr. Mandal received the multitude of doses that he claims. But there have certainly been many irregularities in Bihar during India’s vaccination drive — a massive undertaking with 1.5 billion doses administered so far. In September, when a remarkable 25 million doses were administered to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday, Bihar topped the list of states with about 3.4 million doses. But media reports later suggested that Bihar’s vaccination numbers were likely inaccurate — that data from offline vaccinations from previous days were intentionally withheld and uploaded on the campaign day to inflate the total. Weeks later, it also emerged that one district in Bihar had been reporting ghost vaccinations: Among those recorded as having received the vaccine in the district, but who clearly had not, were Prime Minister Modi himself, as well as some Bollywood celebrities. It is precisely the manual registration that would have come in handy in Mr. Mandal’s quest to keep getting shots before boosters were being offered — and then to keep on boosting every month or so, he said. Mr. Mandal admitted that each time he registered for a new jab, he was asked whether or not he had previously received the shot. “Every time I told them a lie — that I had not,” he said. Dr. Shahi, the district medical chief, said internet problems in Madhepura were such that in many areas vaccinations happened offline and the data was uploaded later. He said what was surprising, if Mr. Mandal’s claim turns out true, is that the portal did not detect repeat uploads when the data went online. As for Mr. Mandal, he said he would keep looking for new opportunities. “I still want more,” he said. New York City will require police officers to conduct more frequent and regular sweeps of the subway system and work with homeless outreach teams to reassure current riders and lure back more commuters to a transit system that needs them, Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a joint announcement on Thursday. The plan mirrors one that Mr. Adams promoted repeatedly during his mayoral campaign: the redeployment of some officers across the transit system and a partnership with trained health professionals who can better address the needs of unhoused and mentally ill people. As transit officials have tried to lure back riders who fled the system at the start of the pandemic and have yet to fully return, they have been contending for more than a year with a persistent perception that the subway system is unsafe. For months, officials have emphasized that serious crimes in the system are at their lowest numbers in decades. Through November, major felonies — murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary and grand larceny — were at their lowest combined total in 25 years. Still, the overall drop in crime may have been expected given the precipitous drop in ridership, which during the pandemic pushed the per rider crime rate higher than it has been in recent years and has added to a perception of greater danger. At least 20 Hong Kong lawmakers, the city’s police chief and several other senior officials are being sent to centralized quarantine after attending a birthday party on Monday, in an embarrassing political and public health headache for the city’s already deeply unpopular government. In all, around 170 people — all the guests at the party, as well as their close contacts — are to be sent to a centralized quarantine facility, city officials announced on Friday, after two people who attended tested positive for the coronavirus. Already, around 60 people have been sent to Penny’s Bay, a facility of shipping-container-like dormitories on an outlying island. The revelation came as Hong Kong, which had gone months without any local transmission, prepares for a new outbreak linked to the Omicron variant. And it followed vigorous calls from the government — which has imposed some of the harshest quarantine and social distancing measures in the world — for residents to avoid public gatherings. The party, at a Spanish tapas restaurant, was for Witman Hung, a local delegate to the Chinese national legislature. Attendees included Caspar Tsui, the city’s home affairs secretary; Raymond Siu, the police commissioner; Au Ka-wang, the immigration director; and 20 lawmakers, who were sworn in this week for a new term. At least one of those lawmakers, Junius Ho, also traveled to Shenzhen two days after the party to meet with a top Chinese government official. At a news conference on Thursday after news of the party emerged, Carrie Lam, the city’s leader, said she was “very disappointed” in the government officials. Several of them have also issued apologies. “I have reflected on this incident and shall be more vigilant in future,” Mr. Au, the immigration director, said in a statement on Friday.  Mr. Au had already been fined last year for breaching social distancing rules at a hot-pot dinner in March. In other news from around the globe:"

The sculptures depict illustrious historical figures with strong ties to this northern Italian city. All 78 of them are of men. They have stood sentry for centuries. But since 1797, when the French Army invaded, there have been a couple of unoccupied pedestals on the canal. So just before the New Year, two city councilors proposed a motion to include a statue of the 17th-century philosopher Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia among those in Prato della Valle. When it comes to the city’s statuary, Prato della Valle is “the symbol of historical male predominance,” said Simone Pillitteri, one of the councilors. “The fact that there were these vacant spots was a glaring reminder that women are underrepresented here and elsewhere and that they were marginalized in the past, certainly not put on pedestals.” Including a statue of Cornaro Piscopia — the first woman in the world to graduate with a university degree, obtained at the University of Padua in philosophy in 1678 — would be a strong sign that “today, our culture has completely changed,” Mr. Pillitteri said. “It would be a sign for the future.” But that simple proposal has spawned a debate over cancel culture, male chauvinism in the 18th century, the underrepresentation of women in art and the historical significance of monuments. Academics, politicians and feminists have weighed in. Critics have cited the findings of a 2021 report by a cultural heritage association that counted barely 200 statues of women in public spaces in Italy. A head count of male statuary in Italy does not exist, but a useful comparison might be found among the 229 busts on Rome’s Pincian Hill. Only three depict women. Some commentators saw the proposal as an example of “cancel culture,” an attempt to rewrite history through the lens of contemporary gender equality. For other opponents, the debate has centered upon the inviolability of a historical monument. “Like it or not, Prato della Valle is an expression of the past,” one in which it was acceptable for a monument of illustrious locals to be all male, said David Tramarin, a local politician and art historian. “We must learn from the past, not change it.” Mr. Tramarin said adding a statue of a woman to the all-male monument felt more like an afterthought. He suggested instead installing several female statues in a centrally located park now under development. “Let’s define a new space and look to the future, a space with many women would be interesting and unique in Italy,” he said. To be fair, Prato della Valle does have a female figure — a bust of the 16th-century poet Gaspara Stampa — but it is relegated to a spot at the feet of the statue of the Renaissance sculptor Andrea Briosco. The other statues depict popes, notable admirals and physicians, but also celebrated Italians who taught at the university, like Galileo. Rosanna Carrieri, a spokeswoman for Mi Riconosci, the association of cultural heritage professionals that worked on the 2021 report and is still counting statues, noted that though women were increasingly represented in public spaces, the iconography often showcased stereotypes. She cited a statue of nude washerwoman in Bologna dating to 2001, as well as a statue of a scantily clad gleaner unveiled last year. “They are symptomatic of a problem of representation, of how women continue to be considered,” she said. Daniela Mapelli, the rector of the University of Padua, said the issue was less about “which statue or which woman to honor, but to invert the tendency and give greater recognition to the role of women in society.” She added, “Even in 2022, this is an issue that struggles to come to the fore.” Last year, Ms. Mapelli made history herself, becoming the first woman to guide the university in 800 years, and one of only eight female rectors at Italy’s more than 80 universities.  She noted that the University of Padua already had a statue of Cornaro Piscopia “prominently located” in its main building. Of late, Padua’s municipal committee, tasked with the city’s new place names, has been giving a lot of thought to “balancing a very strong historical imbalance when it comes to the female presence in streets and piazzas,” said Carlo Fumian, a history professor at the University of Padua who is on the committee. But a proposal to name roundabouts after women had been deemed “not noble enough.” The idea of changing the name of existing streets “risked putting citizens on the warpath,” because of lost mail and other possible problems. Mr. Fumian said that Prato della Valle, which was commissioned in 1775, reflects a specific moment in the city’s past, and that even the vacant pedestals, once adorned by statues of Venetian doges that the French Army destroyed in 1797, “are a piece of Padua’s history.” “You can’t rewrite history with a hammer or scalpel,” he said. “It’s a grave cultural error.” Better to place a placard next to a vacant pedestal, he added, and explain why it is vacant. Margherita Colonnello, the other city councilor who drafted the motion, said its intent was not to “pervert or destroy” the Prato della Valle monument “but to add something new, something that represents present-day history where women play a prominent role,” she said. The “enormous reaction to the proposal,” was unexpected, she said. It reflected the reality that while things were changing in Italy, there still remained “some conservative intellectuals” who did not understand the importance of discussing the underrepresentation of “half the population.” The motion will be discussed in City Hall later this month, she said. Mr. Pillitteri, the city councilor, pointed out that the University of Padua would be celebrating its 800th anniversary in 2022, led by a female rector. “It would be great to mark the event with a new statue of a woman,” and why not, he said, “with some debate.”"

Trump and his allies on Thursday for holding “a dagger at the throat of America” by promoting lies and violence as the nation’s capital fractured into sparring camps a year after the Jan. 6 mob assault on Congress. In his most sustained and scathing repudiation of his predecessor since taking office, Mr. Biden used the anniversary of the Capitol siege to condemn Mr. Trump for waging an “undemocratic” and “un-American” campaign against the legitimacy of the election system, much as autocrats and dictators do, all to avoid admitting defeat. “The former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election,” Mr. Biden said, standing in the National Statuary Hall, which had been invaded by throngs of Trump supporters a year ago. “He’s done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interests as more important than his country’s interests and America’s interests, and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution. He can’t accept he lost.” The president’s address began a commemoration that, instead of showcasing American unity against threats to democracy, only underscored just how riven the country remains a year after rioters armed with hockey sticks, baseball bats, crutches, flagpoles, fire extinguishers, bear spray and stolen police batons broke into the Capitol to disrupt the counting of the Electoral College votes ratifying Mr. Trump’s defeat. Democrats, warning of the undiminished dangers posed by Mr. Trump and his followers, marked the anniversary with a day of events, including speeches, personal testimony, a panel of historians, videos, moments of silence and a candlelight vigil, while Republicans by and large stayed away and refused to participate. No Republican senators showed up on the floor for a session of remarks recalling that day. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of Mr. Trump’s most vocal critics, was the only elected member of her party to join a moment of silence in the House chamber, bringing along her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney. The disparate approaches to the anniversary made clear that Jan. 6 has become just another barometer of America’s partisan divide. Democrats view the storming of the Capitol as an existential attack on the Constitution unlike any in modern times. Most Republicans would rather focus on anything else, with some convinced that Democrats are exploiting it as a weapon against them while others fear crossing Mr. Trump, who continues to dominate the party. Feelings remained raw on Capitol Hill, a place of post-traumatic stress that has yet to fully recover from the psychological and political scars of an assault that led to at least seven deaths as well as injuries to 150 police officers. More than the usual acrimony over legislative differences, the legacy of Jan. 6 has exacerbated the toxic rift between members and staff aides on opposite sides of the aisle. While the elaborate fencing around the Capitol has come down and the National Guard has gone home, many were on edge as the anniversary approached and security forces were on guard. Federal officials saw an uptick in online threats, including a video calling for a mass hanging of lawmakers, but cited no new, credible evidence of organized plots, according to a memo obtained by The New York Times. Online chatter about celebrations and rallies by right-wing groups protesting what they call the persecution of the hundreds of rioters who have been arrested did not translate into large-scale events, and the day passed peacefully in Washington. But emotions were high for Democrats who recalled the fear and dread of that day as lawmakers were rushed out of their chambers by overwhelmed police officers who could not contain rioters chanting “Hang Mike Pence” and hunting for Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont paused to compose himself as he remembered the police officer who took his arm and vowed to protect him. Representative Colin Allred of Texas, a powerfully built former National Football League player, described shedding his coat, expecting to have to physically guard his colleagues. To emphasize the significance of the event, Ms. Pelosi hosted a discussion led by Carla Hayden, the librarian of Congress, with the historians Doris Kearns Goodwin and Jon Meacham, who talked about other moments of peril, like the years leading up to the Civil War. The panel was introduced with a video specially produced by the cast of “Hamilton,” performing a song from the hit musical about the founding of the country. “In my lifetime, this is the hardest moment for democracy,” said Ms. Goodwin. Mr. Meacham, who helped write Mr. Biden’s speech, called this moment “democracy’s hour of maximum danger” and said “it’s either a step on the way to the abyss or it is a call to arms, figuratively, for citizens to engage and say no, we are more important” than “the whim of a single man or a single party.” The absence of Republicans indicated that 1/6 will never be remembered like 9/11, as a moment to come together. The surreal scene of Dick Cheney, himself a former member of the House, being welcomed cordially in the chamber by Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats who once deemed him a war criminal illustrated how much Mr. Trump has transformed the political dynamics of the country. “It’s not a leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for 10 years,” Mr. Cheney said, when asked about top Republicans and their response to the riot. Earlier in the morning, his daughter, who serves as vice chairwoman of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot, castigated fellow Republicans for “looking the other way” rather than confronting the import of the Capitol attack. “All of my colleagues, anyone who attempts to minimize what happened, anyone who denies the truth of what happened, they ought to be ashamed of themselves,” Ms. Cheney said on the “Today” show on NBC. “History is watching, and history will judge them.” In the Senate chamber, Democrats assailed Mr. Trump, “the worst president in modern times,” as Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic majority leader, put it. “It was Donald Trump’s big lie that soaked our political landscape in kerosene,” Mr. Schumer said. “It was Donald Trump’s rally on the Mall that struck the match. And then came the fire.” Mr. Biden’s decision to go after Mr. Trump so directly broke a year of mostly silence in which he avoided acknowledging his predecessor while he tried to fulfill his campaign promise of working across party lines. But with bipartisanship elusive and Washington stalemated, Mr. Biden dispensed with the restraint and gave the sort of full-throated denunciation no sitting president other than the voluble Mr. Trump has issued against a predecessor in modern times. Without using Mr. Trump’s name, the president goaded him by referring to him as the “defeated former president.” He assailed Mr. Trump for encouraging supporters and then “doing nothing for hours as police were assaulted, lives were at risk, and the nation’s capital under siege.” Mr. Biden rejected efforts since then to rewrite history and cast the attackers as patriots. “Is that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the Capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways, rifling through desks of senators and representatives, hunting down members of Congress?” Mr. Biden asked. “Patriots? Not in my view.” “Those who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated and incited and those who called on them to do so,” he added, “held a dagger at the throat of America, at American democracy.” He repeated the imagery in vowing to safeguard the system: “I will stand in this breach. I will defend this nation. And I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy.” Mr. Trump fired back in written statements from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. “This political theater is all just a distraction for the fact Biden has completely and totally failed,” he wrote. “The Democrats want to own this day of Jan. 6 so they can stoke fears and divide America,” he added. “I say, let them have it because America sees through theirs [sic] lies and polarizations.” Mr. Biden offered his most extended rebuttal of the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen, noting that multiple recounts, court battles and inquiries had turned up no meaningful fraud. He pointed out that Republicans had not challenged Republican victories for Congress and governorships based on the same balloting they claim was illegitimate in the presidential race. Mr. Biden also touched on voting rights legislation stalled in the Senate, although he has a separate speech on the subject scheduled for next week. Vice President Kamala D. Harris, who spoke before Mr. Biden, said, “We must pass voting rights bills that are now before the Senate.” Republicans accused the White House and Democrats of politicizing the attack to promote legislation meant to benefit their own party, and rejected Mr. Biden’s indictment of Mr. Trump. “What brazen politicization of Jan. 6 by President Biden,” Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina wrote on Twitter. Mr. Graham himself broke with Mr. Trump on that day a year ago, saying, “All I can say is count me out, enough is enough.” But it did not take long for him, like most Republicans, to fall in line behind the former president again. In a series of tweets on Thursday, Mr. Graham decried the violence on Jan. 6 but not Mr. Trump. “President Biden and Vice President Harris’s speeches today,” he wrote, “were an effort to resurrect a failed presidency more than marking the anniversary of a dark day in American history.” Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House Republican whip, said Mr. Biden and Democrats have a “mass obsession” with Mr. Trump and were distracting from their own failures. “They just want to continue talking about Donald Trump and anything else other than the problems they created,” he said on Fox News. Still, even as Republicans went after Mr. Biden and Democrats, no senior party leaders offered any real defense of Mr. Trump. The former president was left to be defended only by some of his most faithful fringe allies, like Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, who is under federal investigation for sex trafficking, and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a onetime QAnon follower who asserted that a California wildfire was started by a space laser controlled by a Jewish banking family. The two lawmakers offered conspiracy theories blaming the riot on Democrats and federal authorities at a news conference and on a podcast hosted by Stephen K. Bannon, a former adviser to Mr. Trump who himself is under indictment for contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate with the House investigation. “We’re ashamed of nothing,” Mr. Gaetz told Mr. Bannon. “We’re proud of the work we did on Jan. 6 to make legitimate arguments about election integrity.” On the steps of the Capitol, Democrats ended the day with a solemn candlelight vigil, featuring prayer and patriotic song and tributes to the police officers who defended them and in some cases lost their lives. What the nation did not end the day with was a consensus, either about what happened then or what will happen now."

The third 100 million came even faster, in barely five months, as large segments of countries, rich and poor alike, remain unvaccinated and a fast-spreading new variant has proved able to infect even those who are. Case counts, though imperfect, have been a key barometer throughout the pandemic, a benchmark not only for governments implementing mitigation measures but also for people trying to discern the threat in their own communities. Yet surpassing 300 million known cases — a milestone that was reached on Thursday, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University — comes as a growing number of experts argue that it is time to stop focusing on case numbers. So far, the new Omicron variant appears to produce severe illness in fewer people than previous versions of the virus did, and research indicates that Covid vaccines still offer protection against the worst outcomes. And though cases are rising faster than ever — the United States, Australia, France and many other nations are seeing record surges — hospitalizations and deaths from Covid are increasing more slowly. But experts do worry that the sheer number of possible cases may still burden health care systems already strained by previous waves of infection.  This week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert, suggested that it was time to stop focusing on case counts. “As you get further on and the infections become less severe, it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations,” Dr. Fauci told ABC News on Sunday. About 60 percent of the world has received at least a single dose of a Covid vaccine, but nearly three-quarters of all the shots have been administered in the world’s wealthiest nations, leaving people in parts of Africa and Asia vulnerable. In the United States, cases are averaging a staggering 610,000 each day, a 227 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are rising at a slower rate, up 60 percent in the past two weeks, while deaths are up by 2 percent. In France, average daily cases have quadrupled to a record, while hospitalizations have risen by about 70 percent and deaths have doubled, according to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. The trend suggests that the grim cadence seen for the past two years — a wave of infections, followed by a matching surge of hospitalizations, then deaths — may have been altered, in large part because of the protection offered by vaccines. However, because of the way deaths lag cases, it will be weeks before the full effect of the current case surge is reflected in death counts. And because of the widening availability of at-home tests in the United States and Europe, official case numbers — which scientists have long argued are an undercount — may diverge more than ever from actual totals. Not all home tests are reported to authorities and many people may never get tested. Even before Omicron emerged, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that only one in four U.S. infections was reported. Case numbers “definitely mean less than they did” earlier in the pandemic, said Robert West, a professor of health psychology at University College London. “If we had this number of infections then, we’d have had an astronomical number of deaths.” Still, the known death toll remains devastating: more than 830,000 in the United States, 620,000 in Brazil, nearly half a million in India. In many developing nations with huge gaps in health data, the true number may never be known. And Omicron’s impact could be harsher among populations with less protection from vaccines. Some of the fastest increases in cases are occurring in African countries, which have the lowest vaccination rates. Less than a handful of the countries on the continent are on track to meet a World Health Organization goal of administering two doses to 70 percent of their populations, even as rich nations have offered a third. “Booster after booster in a small number of countries will not end a pandemic while billions remain completely unprotected,” the W.H.O. director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Thursday. What is clear, many experts say, is that the virus is likely to become endemic, something that the world will have to live with for years to come, like the flu — and that by the time the world records case 400 million, as it surely will, that statistic will mean even less than it does now. “I think when we had the first wave, a lot of people felt — not experts, but the public and many politicians felt — that if we could only weather the storm, we could come out the other side in the summer of 2020 and everything would be rosy,” Professor West said. “We know now that is never going to be true.” The Mayo Clinic, one of the top-rated health care systems in the United States, said it would dismiss about 1 percent of its employees after they failed to comply with the clinic’s Monday deadline for its vaccine program. Mayo said that about 700 workers would lose their jobs for not meeting the deadline, which required either having received one dose of a vaccine or not being overdue for a second dose. The company employs about 73,000 people. Mayo said it had granted a majority of medical and religious exemption requests. “The needs of the patient come first,” the health system said, citing scientific consensus that coronavirus vaccines are safe and effective. Nationwide, vaccine mandates have often pushed health care workers to receive shots ahead of a looming deadline. But there are usually determined holdouts who choose to lose their jobs instead of getting vaccinated. In October, Northwell Health, the largest health care provider in New York, announced that 1,400 employees — less than 2 percent of its staff — had to leave their jobs after refusing vaccines. Norwell employs more than 77,000 people. Now, during the surge of cases fueled by the Omicron variant, the terminations place a burden on already strained doctors and nurses. More than 100,000 Covid patients are hospitalized nationwide, and hospitalizations have increased 58 percent in the past 14 days, according to data from The New York Times. As patients fill wards, systems face staff shortages as workers test positive. Even before the highly contagious Omicron variant began circulating, health care workers were leaving their jobs, burned out after almost two years of working through the pandemic. The Mayo Clinic — a Minnesota-based hospital system with campuses in Arizona and Florida — left the door open for the employees to apply for future jobs and return if they chose to get vaccinated. But it stressed its standard of care in its statement. “While Mayo Clinic is saddened to lose valuable employees,” the health system said, “we need to take all steps necessary to keep our patients, work force, visitors and communities safe.” Thousands of police officers, firefighters, bus drivers and other public employees across the United States are off the job with what officials have said are record numbers of coronavirus cases, leaving officials scrambling to reassure residents that crucial services will continue. In Dallas, 204 of the roughly 2,100 total employees of the city’s fire and rescue department were in quarantine on Thursday because of positive coronavirus tests — the most since the beginning of the pandemic, according to Jason Evans, a department spokesman. He said that approximately one-quarter of the department’s total positive tests since March 2020 had taken place in the last two weeks. In New York City, on any given day this week, 21 percent of subway operators and conductors — about 1,300 people out of a work force of 6,300 — have been absent from work, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which attributes the jump in absenteeism to the virus. Service has been suspended on three of the system’s 22 subway lines and schedules reduced on many others. The mayor of Cincinnati recently declared a 60-day emergency to address what he described as a “public danger” posed by depleted public-safety staffing. Los Angeles city officials said at a news conference on Thursday that almost 300 firefighters were off duty because of the virus, the most the department had seen at any one time. As recently as mid-December, the figure was 24. The Los Angeles Police Department said it had 505 officers out as a result of the virus. “The Omicron variant has taken off like wildfire,” Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said at a news conference on Thursday. Officials said that the city had authorized extra overtime and had canceled leave for Fire Department employees to cover the absences. The mayor said the police and fire departments “have maintained staffing needed to keep Angelenos safe.” The recent strain on police, fire and other public agencies has intensified disputes over vaccination mandates. In Los Angeles, officials said thousands of police and fire employees had requested medical or religious exemptions to the city’s vaccine mandate. Some have since complied with the rules and gotten shots, but others are still in the midst of lengthy reviews. Some workers who did not get vaccinated by the deadline have been sent home without pay while they go through disciplinary processes. Mr. Garcetti said that about 83 percent of the city’s police officers and firefighters were in compliance with the vaccine mandate. He urged employees, and all city residents, to get booster shots as well. In San Francisco, where rates of new coronavirus case reports are at their highest since the start of the pandemic, public health officials have urged residents to “layer their defenses” by getting booster shots and wearing masks, in part to help ensure that 911 calls are answered quickly and buses and trains run on time. “San Francisco is in a relatively good position, compared to other municipalities,” the city’s director of health, Dr. Grant Colfax, said in a statement. “But the Omicron variant is challenging us, even more than Delta, to manage this disease while keeping our economy, schools and other essential services open.” Jeff Cretan, spokesman for Mayor London Breed, said on Thursday that 140 Fire Department employees and 188 Police Department employees had tested positive or were out because of quarantine protocols; so were 110 workers at the city’s transit agency. Mr. Cretan said that having all of the city’s frontline workers be fully vaccinated had staved off worse trouble. “People aren’t getting sick and ending up in the hospital and dying from our work force,” he said. On the day President Biden was inaugurated, the advisory board of health experts who counseled him during his transition officially ceased to exist. But its members have quietly continued to meet regularly over Zoom, their conversations often turning to frustration with Mr. Biden’s coronavirus response. Now, six of these former advisers have gone public with an extraordinary, albeit polite, critique — and a plea to be heard. In three opinion articles published on Thursday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, they called for Mr. Biden to adopt an entirely new domestic pandemic strategy geared to the “new normal” of living with the virus indefinitely, not to wiping it out. The authors are all big names in American medicine. Several, including Dr. Luciana Borio, a former acting chief scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, and Dr. David Michaels, a former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration now with George Washington University’s School of Public Health, have held high-ranking government positions. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist, medical ethicist and University of Pennsylvania professor who advised former President Barack Obama, organized the effort. Like any White House, Mr. Biden’s prizes loyalty and prefers to keep its differences in house; in that regard, the articles are an unusual step. The authors say they wrote them partly because they have not made headway talking directly to White House officials. “From a macroperspective, it feels like we are always fighting yesterday’s crisis and not necessarily thinking what needs to be done today to prepare us for what comes next,” Dr. Borio said. The authors shared the articles with White House officials before they were published, but it was unclear whether the administration would adopt any of their suggestions. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, Mr. Biden’s top medical adviser for the pandemic, declined to comment on the articles. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters she had not read the articles, and dismissed a question about whether the president “is coming around to accepting” that Covid-19 is here to stay, even though several recent media accounts suggested that the administration was beginning to operate under that assumption. Mr. Biden’s recent emphasis on keeping schools open and businesses running even when cases are soaring also suggests a recalibration, as does a recent decision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend that people with Covid isolate for five days instead of 10. SEOUL — North Korea said on Friday that it would not participate in the Beijing Winter Olympics because of the coronavirus pandemic and moves by “hostile forces.” Its no-show at the Beijing ​Games would deprive South Korea of a rare opportunity to establish official contact with the ​North. Officials from the South had hoped that the ​Olympics would provide a venue for​ official delegates from both Koreas to meet to discuss issues beyond sports. In a letter hand-delivered on Wednesday to China by the North’s ambassador, the country’s Olympic Committee and its ministry of sports wished Beijing a successful Games even though “the U.S. and its vassal forces are getting evermore undisguised in their moves against China aimed at preventing the successful opening of the Olympics,” according to the North’s official Korean Central News Agency on Friday. The letter added that although North Korea “could not take part in the Olympics due to the hostile forces’ moves and the worldwide pandemic,” it “would fully support the Chinese comrades in all their work to hold a splendid and wonderful Olympic festival.” North Korea has maintained some of the world’s toughest restrictions to guard against the spread of the virus. It has rejected outside aid and shut its borders, reportedly placing its guards there under “shoot to kill” orders. The country has claimed no Covid-19 cases, and it has rejected offers of millions of vaccine doses, leaving its population vulnerable to explosive outbreaks should its borders reopen. The pandemic has deepened the North’s diplomatic isolation and economic difficulties. ​On Wednesday, it launched what it called a hypersonic missile. Gov. Jim Justice of West Virginia said he would ask the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for authorization to begin offering fourth doses of a coronavirus vaccine to residents. At a news conference, Mr. Justice, a Republican, said he wanted to start offering fourth doses to people 50 and older, as well as to essential workers, which would make West Virginia the first state to do so. “We’re going to end up with a run on our hospitals like you can’t imagine,” Mr. Justice said, pointing to the highly contagious Omicron variant. Mr. Justice pointed to Israel, one of the first countries to broadly offer a fourth dose to its older citizens, and cited preliminary data from Israel that suggests immunity wanes a few months after a booster shot. Some experts, however, have warned that a fourth shot may be premature. In interviews this week with The New York Times, nearly a dozen scientists said that trying to boost the entire population every few months is not realistic. Nor does it make much scientific sense. Still, the idea may be gaining popularity. Chile said Thursday that it would begin offering fourth shots to immunocompromised citizens next week, Reuters reported, making it the first country in Latin America to do so. But extra shots still lag in the U.S. So far just over a third of American adults have opted for a booster. There are no data to support the effectiveness of a fourth dose of the current vaccines, but cases are rising swiftly and data on fourth doses is coming. “In the midst of this epidemic, the Omicron epidemic, we need to respond swiftly and we need to assess the data,” said Dr. Jorge Salinas, a hospital epidemiologist at Stanford. “If the data is convincing, I think it could be reasonable for certain populations.” In early 2021, West Virginia had one of the highest vaccination rates in the country. Residents are among America’s oldest and least healthy, and officials had partnered with a network of pharmacies and about 200 long-term care facilities to deliver first doses. The state finished its first round of vaccinations at nursing homes in late January, when many other states were just getting started. West Virginia got a jump on delivering nursing home residents their second shots, too. But after the notably rapid start, the state now lags in vaccinations. About 55 percent of people in West Virginia are fully vaccinated, below the national average of 62 percent, according to data from The New York Times. Mr. Justice said that he had anticipated vaccine holdouts, and said he would continue to push for more shots. Dr. Clay Marsh, the official running the state’s coronavirus response, noted that the most vulnerable people, like those who live in nursing homes, had received their vaccines first. Citing the data from Israel, he said their protection may be waning. “We can’t afford in West Virginia to have our most vulnerable get sick with Covid-19,” Dr. Marsh said. Mr. Justice said the federal government had bungled the pandemic response, and suggested that individual states take control. “We’ve got to do something,” Mr. Justice said. “Either we sit back and just let our people die, and we sit back and let our hospitals be overrun, or we try.” James Corden joined the ranks of late-night TV hosts who have recently tested positive for the coronavirus, disclosing his diagnosis on Thursday as tapings of his CBS program, “The Late Late Show,” were halted for the next several days. Corden said in a social media post on Thursday, “I just tested positive for covid 19. I’m fully vaccinated, boosted and because of this am fortunate enough to say I feel completely fine. The show will be off the air for the next few days. Stay safe everyone. All my love, James x.” A programming schedule released by CBS on Thursday indicated that “The Late Late Show,” which is recorded in Los Angeles, would air repeat broadcasts starting Thursday night and running through Jan. 17. Corden’s announcement came two days after Seth Meyers, the host of NBC’s “Late Night,” said that he had tested positive and halted tapings of his show. Jimmy Fallon, the host of “The Tonight Show” on NBC, said that he had tested positive for coronavirus during a holiday break, but he has returned to the program this week. Ian Karmel, a head writer for “The Late Late Show,” joked about Corden in a Twitter post on Thursday: “I told him it was hacky to do this after Fallon and Seth both did it, but whatever,” Karmel wrote. “Saturday Night Live,” which like “The Tonight Show” and “Late Night” is produced at NBC’s headquarters in New York, ran its 2021 year-end episode without a studio audience, a musical guest or many of its cast members amid concerns about Covid. NBC said on Thursday that “S.N.L.” would resume live episodes on Jan. 15. Stephen Colbert told his audience earlier this week that he intended to continue hosting CBS’s flagship “Late Show” from the stage of the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York for as long as possible. “It’s a privilege to do this show,” Colbert said on the program, “and if I do get it, I promise you, I will not be doing my show.” The Biden administration has largely responded to the near vertical rise in coronavirus cases by pushing for more people to get not only their initial doses of vaccine, but booster shots as well. This week, federal health officials endorsed boosters for youths 12 to 17 who had initially gotten the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The government also changed the definition of “up to date” Covid vaccination to include boosters. But even as the United States has moved rapidly to expand who is eligible for boosters, progress in persuading Covid-fatigued Americans to get them has stalled. About 62 percent of Americans — about 206 million people — are fully vaccinated, according to federal data. But according to a C.D.C. database, only about 35 percent of Americans have received a booster since mid-August, when additional shots were first authorized, even as eligibility has greatly expanded. On Nov. 19, the F.D.A. authorized boosters for everyone 18 and older who had received two doses of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, and on Dec. 9, it authorized boosters of the Pfizer vaccine for 16- and 17-year-olds. Those changes led to more Americans getting boosters, according to the federal database, but that has since leveled off. After the discovery of the Omicron variant in late November, the pace of all vaccinations sped up, but it peaked in early December, and then it plateaued. (Reporting lags around the Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s holidays have affected the daily numbers throughout this period.) Omicron, which is highly transmissible, has shown that it is better at evading vaccines than other variants. But scientists say booster shots can offer substantial protection, especially against severe disease. The United States is averaging a staggering 585,000 cases a day, a record and a 247 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are rising more slowly, up 53 percent in the past two weeks, and a smaller percentage of patients are landing in intensive care units or requiring mechanical ventilation, compared with those in previous waves. Deaths are down by 3 percent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention went even further in encouraging booster shots on Wednesday, when health officials recommended that to remain up to date, people should get three doses of Pfizer’s or Moderna’s vaccines. The agency also recommended that recipients of Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose vaccine receive a second dose, preferably of Moderna’s or Pfizer’s. “There really isn’t debate here in what people should do,” the C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, said in an interview on Tuesday. “If they’re eligible for a boost, they should get boosted.” Still, the expansion of booster shot eligibility has not been met with an equal amount of demand. Dr. Rebekah E. Gee, the former health secretary of Louisiana, chalked up the resistance to boosters to pandemic fatigue. Referring to the pandemic’s many problems, Dr. Gee said some people simply “don’t want this to be there” and are trying to “will it out of existence.” Shortly after coronavirus vaccines were rolled out about a year ago, women started reporting erratic menstrual cycles after receiving the shots. Some said their periods were late. Others reported heavier bleeding than usual or painful bleeding.  A study published on Thursday found that women’s menstrual cycles did indeed change following vaccination against the coronavirus. The authors reported that women who were inoculated had slightly longer menstrual cycles after receiving the vaccine than those who were not vaccinated. Their periods themselves, which came almost a day later on average, were not prolonged, however, and the effect was transient, with cycle lengths bouncing back to normal within one or two months.  The study, in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, is one of the first to support anecdotal reports from women that their menstrual cycles were off after vaccination, said Dr. Hugh Taylor, the chair of the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at Yale School of Medicine. “It validates that there is something real here,” said Dr. Taylor, who has heard about irregular cycles from his own patients. At the same time, he added, the changes seen in the study were not significant and appeared to be transient. “I want to make sure we dissuade people from those untrue myths out there about fertility effects,” Dr. Taylor said. “A cycle or two where periods are thrown off may be annoying, but it’s not going to be harmful in a medical way.” It’s not clear why the menstrual cycle might be affected by vaccination, but most women with regular periods experience an occasional unusual cycle or missed period. Hormones secreted by the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland and the ovaries regulate the monthly cycle, and they can be affected by environmental factors, stressors and life changes. (The changes observed in the study were not caused by pandemic-related conditions, the authors said, since women in the unvaccinated group were also living in the pandemic.) Novak Djokovic, the top player in men’s tennis and its leading vaccine skeptic, was stopped at the border in Melbourne late Wednesday after flying from Dubai to defend his Australian Open title. State government and Australian tennis officials had granted Mr. Djokovic an exemption from Covid vaccination rules that would allow him to compete in the event. But upon his arrival, federal border officials said that Mr. Djokovic did not meet the country’s requirements for entry because he was unvaccinated, and they canceled his visa. He filed a legal appeal on Thursday. The exemption had stirred anger in Australia, which has enforced tough rules to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and has maintained one of the world’s lowest Covid death rates. Citizens who endured long lockdowns, and for months faced strict limits on leaving or returning to the country, demanded to know if Mr. Djokovic had been given special treatment. Mr. Djokovic’s limbo appears to be rooted in confusion over the exemption granted by Australian tennis officials and local authorities in Victoria, the state where the tournament is held. The exemption was believed to have been approved because of Mr. Djokovic’s previous coronavirus infections — grounds that federal officials had warned were invalid. As a dizzying surge in coronavirus cases spurred by the fast-spreading Omicron variant has disrupted life in New York City and undermined its economic recovery, its subway system — the nation’s largest — has confronted a staggering worker shortage that has hampered its ability to keep trains running. On any given day this week, 21 percent of subway operators and conductors — about 1,300 people out of a work force of 6,300 — have been absent from work, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the city’s subways, buses and two commuter-rail lines. The soaring jump in absenteeism, which the transportation authority attributes to the virus, has meant a lack of workers to keep up with the regular train schedules, leading officials to suspend service this week on three of the system’s 22 subway lines and reduce schedules on many others, leading to longer wait times. The unraveling of train schedules is the latest hit to a transit network that has been battered by the pandemic, which has killed more than 150 workers and chased away millions of daily riders and the fares they pay, inflicting a brutal financial blow that threatens the system’s future. The worker shortage has not shut down service at any of the system’s 472 subway stations — all those on the suspended lines are served by other trains. But the disruptions have led to longer commutes and travel delays for riders, a major challenge for transit officials who were hoping to lure back more passengers at the start of the year. “I feel like it’s been bad since Christmas,” Jennifer Hall, 41, said Wednesday morning as she waited with her son for a D train in the Bronx. Portugal’s government said on Thursday it would loosen pandemic rules for people who have received a booster dose of the coronavirus vaccine, in order to encourage residents to maintain the country’s status as one of Europe’s most vaccinated. People who have received a booster will no longer be required to present a negative Covid test to attend events or enter sites where that is otherwise mandatory. People with booster shots will also no longer have to isolate themselves after coming in contact with a person diagnosed with the coronavirus, unless the infected person lives with them. People without booster shots will still be required to isolate after any contact. The new rules, announced by Prime Minister António Costa, will come into force on Monday. Portugal is relaxing its rules in part to forestall staff shortages and disruptions in workplaces and schools as it grapples with the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, which is better at bypassing vaccine protection than earlier virus variants were. Portugal mounted one of Europe’s most successful vaccination rollouts last year, and 89 percent of its population of about 10 million people has now been fully vaccinated, Mr. Costa said. About three million residents have also received a booster so far. Last month, as Omicron started to spread, Portugal reintroduced a battery of restrictions, including the closure of nightclubs and bars and a requirement for negative tests to enter hotels and restaurants. The government said on Thursday that bars and clubs could reopen on Jan. 14. Portugal reported 39,000 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, its highest daily since the appearance of Omicron. Mr. Costa noted that Omicron accounted for about 90 percent of the new cases, and that so far at least, they were not overwhelming hospitals. “Despite having many more cases, we thankfully have a much lower level of hospitalization” than a year ago, Mr. Costa said. As a result, he said, Portugal was in a “quiet situation” that allowed for the lifting of some restrictions “with caution.” Xi’an, a city of 13 million people, has been under a citywide lockdown since Dec. 22. It is the longest lockdown in China since the first one in Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak began almost two years ago. In scenes recalling the early days of the pandemic, hungry residents have traded coffee for eggs and cigarettes for instant noodles. A pregnant woman and an 8-year-old boy with leukemia are among those who have been denied medical care. People in need of lifesaving medications have struggled to obtain them. China’s ability to control the virus has come a long way since the pandemic started: The country has inoculated nearly 1.2 billion people and set up a nationwide electronic health database for contact tracing. Yet it has continued to rely on the same authoritarian virus-fighting methods from early 2020, including strict quarantines, border closings and lockdowns. These have led to food and medical shortages and growing questions about how much longer its zero-Covid strategy, the last in the world, can continue. Parents across Chicago raced to find child care on Wednesday morning after jarring news: Classes in the nation’s third-largest public school district were canceled. The teachers’ union and Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration had failed to agree on how to keep schools open during an Omicron-fueled virus surge. Across the country, the wildly contagious Omicron variant has infected millions and complicated the return to classrooms and workplaces. But nowhere has returning to school been more acrimonious and unpredictable than in Chicago, where, after two days back in classrooms following winter break, 73 percent of teachers voted to stop reporting to work. The city responded by calling off school altogether, refusing the teachers’ call for remote instruction. With no deal reached by Wednesday evening, district officials said classes would be canceled again on Thursday. The abrupt pause in the academic calendar, rooted in years of enmity between the Chicago Teachers Union and City Hall, jumbled plans for hundreds of thousands of students and posed another major test for Ms. Lightfoot, a Democrat whose tenure has been marked by labor strife, the pandemic and a surge in homicides. “If they are in class and Covid is rampaging, that’s a problem. If they are not there and out on the streets, that’s a problem,” said Tamar Manasseh, who leads an anti-violence group in the city, and who said she was looking into ways to help children with nowhere to go during the day. “This has put us in an untenable situation.” Ms. Lightfoot, whose disagreements with the Chicago Teachers Union date back to a strike in the early months of her term, said in an interview that the two sides remained far apart as negotiations continued. Ms. Lightfoot said she intended to take legal action against the union, and on Monday evening said the city had filed an unfair labor practices complaint. The school district opened buildings for meal distribution on Wednesday and published a list of places where parents could get emergency child care. “The consequences of the union acting like this time and time again are profound,” Ms. Lightfoot said. She added, “You think about the consequences for the families to be faced with the hostage choice of either going to work or taking care of their kids and home-schooling — no parent should be put in that position.” TOKYO — Japan asked the United States on Thursday to impose lockdowns on its military bases in the country as it tries to stanch a rapid climb in Covid infections linked in part to outbreaks among American service members. While Japan has not yet seen the kind of explosion in cases experienced by other countries grappling with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, daily case numbers passed 2,600 on Wednesday after remaining in the low hundreds through late December. “The government of Japan is deeply concerned about the spread of infections on Japanese and American military facilities and in the surrounding areas,” the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, told reporters. Japan’s foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, made the lockdown request to his American counterpart, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, during a phone call to discuss diplomatic issues, Mr. Matsuno said. It was unclear what steps the United States would take. The spread of the virus on American military bases in Japan has outpaced that in the country at large, and local authorities have linked outbreaks in their communities to contact among residents and U.S. personnel. Japan has largely closed its borders to foreigners since the beginning of the pandemic, and it further tightened restrictions soon after the first cases of Omicron were identified in southern Africa in November. Travelers to Japan must present a negative Covid test before departure. But American service members have been allowed to enter the country without testing, Mr. Matsuno told reporters in late December. The requirement was waived under the status of forces agreement that governs the large U.S. military presence in the country. On Thursday, the governor of Okinawa said he would ask the government to help prepare the prefecture to go onto an emergency footing as daily case counts approach 1,000. Cases there have increased significantly after an outbreak at one of the island’s American military bases. Another outbreak has been linked to the Marine Corps base in Iwakuni, southwest of Hiroshima. In response, local officials asked the facility to restrict the movement of its personnel in an effort to stem the transmission. A senior Hong Kong official was sent to quarantine after attending a birthday party with a person who later tested positive for the coronavirus, the government said on Thursday, fueling public scorn in a city facing the threat of a new wave of the pandemic. Hong Kong has largely managed to keep the coronavirus at bay, but health officials have warned that the Omicron variant could change that. Carrie Lam, the chief executive, announced a series of new restrictions on Wednesday, including a two-week ban on flights from eight countries, among them the United States. Mrs. Lam said Thursday that she was “disappointed” in the officials who attended the party on Monday, days after Hong Kong began reporting the local spread of Omicron cases. The first local cluster of the variant is believed to have started on Dec. 27, when a flight attendant for Cathay Pacific violated quarantine to dine out with family members. While Monday’s party did not break any current rules, it was a bad look at a time when the government has been urging extra caution. But Mrs. Lam dismissed comparisons between her and the management of Cathay Pacific, whom she had criticized for its staff’s rule violations. “If all you want is for me to say the chief executive should take responsibility for every matter and every action of the principal officials, this is not the duty of chief executive,” she said at a news conference. “All I can say is we are making an all-out effort in fighting the epidemic.” Ten senior government officials were among 100 people who attended Monday’s party, at a Spanish restaurant in the Wan Chai District of Hong Kong Island. They included the police chief, the immigration director and the head of the city’s anticorruption body. Eight of them are believed to have left before the person later confirmed to be infected arrived, Mrs. Lam said. Caspar Tsui, the secretary for home affairs, stayed longer and is considered a close contact of the positive case. He has been sent to a government-run quarantine center at Penny’s Bay, Mrs. Lam said. Mr. Tsui posted an apology on Facebook, saying that as an official, he “should be more vigilant and cautious to take action with epidemic prevention as the first consideration!” Comments on the post were filled with schadenfreude that a top official would have to face the same onerous quarantine that Hong Kong residents who travel abroad must undergo. One posted a 2020 headline quoting Mr. Tsui saying that punishments should be increased against rule-breakers who risked making the pandemic worse. WASHINGTON — President Biden came into office vowing to restore public trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after the Trump White House had tied the agency’s hands and manipulated its scientific judgments on the pandemic for political ends. Yet in his first year, Mr. Biden has presided over a series of messaging failures that have followed a familiar pattern, with the agency’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, and her team making what experts say are largely sound decisions, but fumbling in communicating them to America. Dr. Walensky, a highly regarded infectious disease expert from Boston with no prior government experience, insisted in February that schools must keep students six feet apart; in March, she said three feet was enough. She said in February that teachers did not need to be vaccinated to reopen schools; the White House said the next day that she was speaking “in her personal capacity.” In May, she said that vaccinated people generally did not need to wear masks in public, a sudden change that flummoxed state health officials. Two months later, she reversed that guidance after it was shown that vaccinated people could still transmit the coronavirus. More recently, with the Omicron variant driving a near vertical rise in cases, Dr. Walensky alerted the White House that she planned to recommend that people infected with the virus isolate for five days instead of 10. To avoid another messaging fiasco, she briefed other top Biden health officials on her proposal so they would all be on the same page, according to two people familiar with her actions. But both Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, and Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, the surgeon general, took issue on national television with the agency’s policy of not requiring a negative Covid test before ending the shorter isolation. Dr. Tom Frieden, the agency’s director under President Barack Obama, said he did not believe the latest recommendations on isolation were significantly wrong, but “the way they were released was very problematic.” The crux of the problem, several administration officials said, is a failure by the C.D.C. and the Biden administration’s messaging experts to work in concert. Dr. Walensky’s critics say she is not collaborative enough, too often springing decisions on other federal officials who then struggle to defend them in public. Her defenders say that she strives to coordinate, but that it is not her job to ensure consensus across the entire administration. Some suggest the White House has gone too far in its hands-off, let-the-scientists-rule approach, leaving a vacuum of leadership and forcing ad hoc coordination between the various public health agencies. There is vaccine hesitancy, but on the flip side, there is Brahmdeo Mandal. Mr. Mandal is so excited about the healing promise of a jab that he says he has received 12 coronavirus vaccine doses — so far. How, you may ask? Mr. Mandal, an 85-year-old retired postman from the northern Indian state of Bihar, is happy to share. He said he received his first dose on Feb. 13 at a local clinic, and he hasn’t stopped since. He has recorded the date and location of each jab in a pocket notebook. His ninth shot, he said, was on Sept. 24 at 12:32 p.m. at a hospital in Kalashan, Madhepura District. “I felt that it was helping my general health,” he said in a phone interview. “My backache has improved, my general weakness improved, and my appetite improved.” “I was always looking for new vaccine camps and would go there,” Mr. Mandal said. “Nobody would recognize me.” Dr. Amarendra Narayan Shahi, the chief medical officer in Madhepura, said he had spoken to Mr. Mandal who had told him about his quest to get more doses because he believed it cured his ailments, many of them natural at his age. “Yes, he is claiming that he got 12 doses,” Dr. Shahi said. “I have constituted a three-member investigating team to find the truth.” For nine of the 12 shots Mr. Mandal registered to receive, he said he used his national identity card and his mobile number. After that, he said, he switched to alternative forms of identification, like his voting card and the mobile numbers of his wife and his friends. Exactly how Mr. Mandal was found out is unclear, but it appeared to be a case of him boasting about his many boosters to someone who had then tipped off the local news media. Authorities in the district of Madhepura say they have also started an investigation. There is no indication that supercharging the immune system with 12 shots brings any real benefits, or would help with anything other than what the vaccine is intended to do. In fact, there is an ongoing debate on whether boosting the immune system over and over can cause it to become fatigued, or to prevent it from responding to future versions of the vaccine. Only an investigation will confirm whether Mr. Mandal received the multitude of doses that he claims. But there have certainly been many irregularities in Bihar during India’s vaccination drive — a massive undertaking with 1.5 billion doses administered so far. In September, when a remarkable 25 million doses were administered to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday, Bihar topped the list of states with about 3.4 million doses. But media reports later suggested that Bihar’s vaccination numbers were likely inaccurate — that data from offline vaccinations from previous days were intentionally withheld and uploaded on the campaign day to inflate the total. Weeks later, it also emerged that one district in Bihar had been reporting ghost vaccinations: Among those recorded as having received the vaccine in the district, but who clearly had not, were Prime Minister Modi himself, as well as some Bollywood celebrities. It is precisely the manual registration that would have come in handy in Mr. Mandal’s quest to keep getting shots before boosters were being offered — and then to keep on boosting every month or so, he said. Mr. Mandal admitted that each time he registered for a new jab, he was asked whether or not he had previously received the shot. “Every time I told them a lie — that I had not,” he said. Dr. Shahi, the district medical chief, said internet problems in Madhepura were such that in many areas vaccinations happened offline and the data was uploaded later. He said what was surprising, if Mr. Mandal’s claim turns out true, is that the portal did not detect repeat uploads when the data went online. As for Mr. Mandal, he said he would keep looking for new opportunities. “I still want more,” he said. New York City will require police officers to conduct more frequent and regular sweeps of the subway system and work with homeless outreach teams to reassure current riders and lure back more commuters to a transit system that needs them, Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a joint announcement on Thursday. The plan mirrors one that Mr. Adams promoted repeatedly during his mayoral campaign: the redeployment of some officers across the transit system and a partnership with trained health professionals who can better address the needs of unhoused and mentally ill people. As transit officials have tried to lure back riders who fled the system at the start of the pandemic and have yet to fully return, they have been contending for more than a year with a persistent perception that the subway system is unsafe. For months, officials have emphasized that serious crimes in the system are at their lowest numbers in decades. Through November, major felonies — murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary and grand larceny — were at their lowest combined total in 25 years. Still, the overall drop in crime may have been expected given the precipitous drop in ridership, which during the pandemic pushed the per rider crime rate higher than it has been in recent years and has added to a perception of greater danger. At least 20 Hong Kong lawmakers, the city’s police chief and several other senior officials are being sent to centralized quarantine after attending a birthday party on Monday, in an embarrassing political and public health headache for the city’s already deeply unpopular government. In all, around 170 people — all the guests at the party, as well as their close contacts — are to be sent to a centralized quarantine facility, city officials announced on Friday, after two people who attended tested positive for the coronavirus. Already, around 60 people have been sent to Penny’s Bay, a facility of shipping-container-like dormitories on an outlying island. The revelation came as Hong Kong, which had gone months without any local transmission, prepares for a new outbreak linked to the Omicron variant. And it followed vigorous calls from the government — which has imposed some of the harshest quarantine and social distancing measures in the world — for residents to avoid public gatherings. The party, at a Spanish tapas restaurant, was for Witman Hung, a local delegate to the Chinese national legislature. Attendees included Caspar Tsui, the city’s home affairs secretary; Raymond Siu, the police commissioner; Au Ka-wang, the immigration director; and 20 lawmakers, who were sworn in this week for a new term. At least one of those lawmakers, Junius Ho, also traveled to Shenzhen two days after the party to meet with a top Chinese government official. At a news conference on Thursday after news of the party emerged, Carrie Lam, the city’s leader, said she was “very disappointed” in the government officials. Several of them have also issued apologies. “I have reflected on this incident and shall be more vigilant in future,” Mr. Au, the immigration director, said in a statement on Friday.  Mr. Au had already been fined last year for breaching social distancing rules at a hot-pot dinner in March. In other news from around the globe:"

But upon his arrival, federal border officials said that Mr. Djokovic did not meet the country’s requirements for entry because he was unvaccinated, and they canceled his visa. He filed a legal appeal on Thursday. The exemption had stirred anger in Australia, which has enforced tough rules to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and has maintained one of the world’s lowest Covid death rates. Citizens who endured long lockdowns, and for months faced strict limits on leaving or returning to the country, demanded to know if Mr. Djokovic had been given special treatment. Mr. Djokovic’s limbo appears to be rooted in confusion over the exemption granted by Australian tennis officials and local authorities in Victoria, the state where the tournament is held. The exemption was believed to have been approved because of Mr. Djokovic’s previous coronavirus infections — grounds that federal officials had warned were invalid. Here’s a look at how the standoff has unfolded: Mr. Djokovic has received scrutiny for his unscientific beliefs, including his assertion that positive emotions can purify toxic water or food. He has been dismissive toward the pandemic and said vaccinations should not be mandated for travel. In June 2020, with tennis and other sports paused because of the coronavirus, he organized a charity tournament in his native Serbia and nearby Croatia. Masks and social distancing were minimal, and several players, including Mr. Djokovic, later tested positive for the coronavirus. Mr. Djokovic has won the last three Australian Opens, and nine overall. But his vaccine stance put in doubt his ability to defend his title. Last year, the Australian Open said participants would have to be fully vaccinated, in line with requirements for entering the country. Mr. Djokovic’s participation was seen as unlikely until he announced on Tuesday that he would play after receiving an exemption. He did not say why he had received the exemption; neither did Australian tennis officials. But they explained that 26 people who had applied for a vaccine waiver had had their requests reviewed by panels of medical officials from both Tennis Australia and the state of Victoria. A small number were granted. The requests were reviewed under guidelines from an official government advisory body on vaccinations. The group listed several possible reasons for exemptions, including a Covid-19 infection within the last six months, inflammatory cardiac illness, or acute medical conditions such as major surgery. Mr. Djokovic’s application was based on a recent infection, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. Mr. Djokovic’s exemption was denounced by many in Australia as the Omicron variant has driven a jump in new cases and residents have faced long delays in testing. After Mr. Djokovic arrived in Melbourne, he was questioned for hours at the airport before being sent to a quarantine hotel. Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, who has faced criticism over the government’s Covid response in recent days, announced that Mr. Djokovic’s entry had been denied. “Rules are rules, especially when it comes to our borders,” Mr. Morrison wrote on Twitter. “No one is above these rules.” In November, Greg Hunt, the Australian health minister, said in a letter to Craig Tiley, the head of Tennis Australia, that people who had contracted Covid-19 and had not been fully vaccinated would not qualify for quarantine-free entry. Mr. Hunt added that the grounds for an exemption, such as a recent infection, are meant “for domestic purposes only — such as interstate travel, or meeting workplace vaccination requirements — and does not apply in the context of international borders.” It was not clear why Tennis Australia and the Victoria government then granted Mr. Djokovic the exemption. Mr. Morrison said on Thursday that there had “not necessarily” been any problem with Australia’s initial granting of a visa to Mr. Djokovic, and that it was up to travelers with visas to show proof of full vaccination at the border. Mr. Djokovic filed an appeal in federal court in Victoria, and he will be allowed to remain in the country at least until Monday as he awaits a hearing. It was unclear if quarantine remained an option, or whether Mr. Djokovic would accept it. The tournament starts in 11 days, sooner than Australia’s usual two-week quarantine."

When the South belatedly discovered the breach, it began an extensive manhunt. The man was not found until the next day, half a mile south of the world’s most heavily armed border. It was one of the South Korean military’s most embarrassing moments in years. On New Year’s Day, officials say, the man humiliated the military again by making the trip in reverse, climbing the same fences and crossing the Demilitarized Zone to return to the North. His extraordinary feat not only highlighted South Korean security flaws at the 2.5-mile-wide buffer zone, known as the DMZ, but raised the bewildering question of why someone would risk his life by crossing it twice. The DMZ is lined with barbed-wire fences, minefields and armed sentries. Few North Koreans who defect to the South do so by crossing it directly (most go through China), and it is even rarer for a defector to return that way. “We are sorry for causing concerns to the people,” Gen. Won In-choul, the chairman of South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff, told lawmakers on Wednesday. “We will make every effort so there is no recurrence of similar incidents.” At the same hearing, Defense Minister Suh Wook confirmed that South Korea believed the border-crosser was the former gymnast who defected in 2020. The government has not released his name, but other North Korean defectors have identified him as Kim Woo-joo, 29. They said he had few friends, and his motive for going home was still a mystery on Thursday. Some lawmakers have speculated that he was a spy, but President Moon Jae-in’s government said it had found no evidence of that. A series of lapses let him slip through the DMZ, said Lt. Gen. Jeon Dong-jin, who led the army’s investigation into the security breach. He was first picked up by a military security camera about 1 p.m. on Saturday, as he was walking toward an area just south of the DMZ, in the eastern province of Gangwon, that is off-limits to civilians. A warning was broadcast over loudspeakers, but the military took no further action after the man seemed to change course and head for a nearby village. Six hours later, he was climbing the first tall fence on the southern edge of the DMZ. Three cameras captured the scene, but a soldier on duty, who was monitoring real-time feeds from nine cameras on a single computer screen, missed it. Sensors on the fence triggered an alarm, but a first-response team ruled that nothing was amiss. Hours later, in the dead of night, the military’s thermal observation devices detected the man deep inside the DMZ, on his way to North Korea. Of the roughly 34,000 North Koreans who have defected to South Korea, 30 have mysteriously resurfaced in the North in the past decade. Some are believed to have been blackmailed into returning. Others have fled criminal charges in South Korea. Still others are thought to have gone back because, after growing up in North Korea’s highly regimented, totalitarian society, they could not adjust to the hypercompetitive life of the South, where defectors are often treated like second-class citizens. What little is known about Mr. Kim’s life in the South suggests that he may fall into that category. Fellow defectors say that Mr. Kim, like most North Koreans who come to the South, adopted a new name: Kim Woo-jeong. He appears to have had a hard life in both Koreas, according to officials and lawmakers who received briefings from military and intelligence officials. Like all defectors, Mr. Kim was debriefed by the South Korean government upon arrival. He said he had fled the North to escape an abusive stepfather. At the time, Mr. Kim weighed barely more than 110 pounds; he stood just taller than 4-foot-11. Crossing the North’s border with China — the usual route for refugees — had become nearly impossible because of the coronavirus pandemic. To keep the virus out, North Korea had greatly tightened its controls at that border, reportedly placing its guards under “shoot to kill” orders. Instead, Mr. Kim crossed the DMZ, where, South Korean officials said, his gymnastic skills helped him climb the tall fences. In South Korea, his life seems to have been a difficult one. He made few friends, officials said. He found work at cleaning services whose employees worked mostly at night in empty office buildings. He apparently never socialized with his neighbors. Since Sunday, when reports first emerged of his return to the North, no one in the South has come forward to say that they knew him personally. Kang Mi-jin, a North Korean who lives in Seoul, said that a defector’s early experiences could be crucial. “It’s important what first jobs they find in the South and how they are treated here,” she said. “That’s where they learn whether their dream is supported by reality.” Their first friends are usually fellow North Koreans, whom they meet during the government’s 12-week resettlement training program. Before the pandemic, when as many as 3,000 defectors were arriving every year, those classrooms were full. But with the North’s Chinese border locked down, only 229 North Koreans came to the South in 2020, the year Mr. Kim defected. “He had few classmates and few friends,” said Ahn Chan-il, the leader of a defectors’ group in Seoul. South Korean churches, where many defectors have found communities, have been under restrictions during the pandemic. If Mr. Kim was suffering from poverty and loneliness in the South, he was hardly the only defector who felt that way. Nearly a quarter of North Korean defectors — six times the national average — are receiving government subsidies for basic necessities because they are in the lowest income bracket. Those among them who earn wages make 70 percent of the national average, according to a survey of 407 defectors conducted last year by the Seoul-based Database Center for North Korean Human Rights. Thirty-five percent of those defectors reported experiencing depression and despair, and 18.5 percent said they had thought of returning to the North, mainly because they missed their families and hometowns, according to the survey. One reason many unhappy defectors endure life in the South is that they can save money and send it to their families in the North through middlemen in China, who usually charge a 30 percent fee. But temporary jobs like the ones held by many defectors were among the first to be cut by employers as the pandemic raged. Living alone in a tiny, $117-a-month apartment in northern Seoul, Mr. Kim received $418 a month in welfare support from the government. He rarely cooked and skimped on gas, water and electricity, and he had unpaid bills for rent and medical insurance, according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap. “We help the North Korean refugees resettle when they first arrive, but we have been miserly in helping them find jobs and make their life here sustainable,” Park Soo-hyun, Mr. Moon’s senior secretary for public communications, said this week. For some defectors, the transition to the South is like that experienced by a prisoner, released after many years, who cannot readjust to the outside world, said Lee Min-bok, a longtime North Korean refugee. “They are strangers to the sudden freedom in the South, finding it more difficult than life in North Korea, which is essentially a prison,” Mr. Lee said. “The ostracism they feel in the South is not much different from the discrimination ex-prisoners suffer on the outside.” The culture shock is especially hard for the few who cross the DMZ. Many defectors spend years living in China, which is far more open to the world than North Korea is. By the time they come to the South, they have some idea of what to expect. As of Thursday, North Korea had said nothing about Mr. Kim’s return. It has often used returning defectors for propaganda, releasing videos and articles in which they describe a hellish life in the capitalist South. Mr. Kim left few traces behind. At the fence where he crossed, investigators found thin footprints and bits of feather, which apparently fell from his winter coat when it was torn by barbed wire. Reporters who went to his home found it empty, with a neatly folded blanket put outside for the garbage collector to pick up."

Read more in a note from Times Opinion’s politics editor Ezekiel Kweku in our Opinion Today newsletter. The Jan. 6 attack on Congress by a mob inspired by former President Donald Trump marked an ominous precedent for U.S. politics. Not since the Civil War had the country failed to effect a peaceful transfer of power, and no previous candidate purposefully contested an election’s results in the face of broad evidence that it was free and fair. The event continues to reverberate in American politics — but its impact is not just domestic. It has also had a large impact internationally and signals a significant decline in American global power and influence. Jan. 6 needs to be seen against the backdrop of the broader global crisis of liberal democracy. According to Freedom House’s 2021 Freedom in the World report, democracy has been in decline for 15 straight years, with some of the largest setbacks coming in the world’s two largest democracies, the United States and India. Since that report was issued, coups took place in Myanmar, Tunisia and Sudan, countries that had previously taken promising steps toward democracy. The world had experienced a huge expansion in the number of democracies, from around 35 in the early 1970s to well over 110 by the time of the 2008 financial crisis. The United States was critical to what was labeled the “Third Wave” of democratization. America provided security to democratic allies in Europe and East Asia, and presided over an increasingly integrated global economy that quadrupled its output in that same period. But global democracy was underpinned by the success and durability of democracy in the United States itself — what the political scientist Joseph Nye labels its “soft power.” People around the world looked up to America’s example as one they sought to emulate, from the students in Tiananmen Square in 1989 to the protesters leading the “color revolutions” in Europe and the Middle East in subsequent decades. The decline of democracy worldwide is driven by complex forces. Globalization and economic change have left many behind, and a huge cultural divide has emerged between highly educated professionals living in cities and residents of smaller towns with more traditional values. The rise of the internet has weakened elite control over information; we have always disagreed over values, but we now live in separate factual universes. And the desire to belong and have one’s dignity affirmed are often more powerful forces than economic self-interest. The world thus looks very different from the way it did roughly 30 years ago, when the former Soviet Union collapsed. There were two key factors I underestimated back then — first, the difficulty of creating not just democracy, but also a modern, impartial, uncorrupt state; and second, the possibility of political decay in advanced democracies. The American model has been decaying for some time. Since the mid-1990s, the country’s politics have become increasingly polarized and subject to continuing gridlock, which has prevented it from performing basic government functions like passing budgets. There were clear problems with American institutions — the influence of money in politics, the effects of a voting system increasingly unaligned with democratic choice — yet the country seemed to be unable to reform itself. Earlier periods of crisis like the Civil War and the Great Depression produced farsighted, institution-building leaders; not so in the first decades of the 21st century, which saw American policymakers presiding over two catastrophes — the Iraq war and the subprime financial crisis — and then witnessed the emergence of a shortsighted demagogue egging on an angry populist movement. Up until Jan. 6, one might have seen these developments through the lens of ordinary American politics, with its disagreements on issues like trade, immigration and abortion. But the uprising marked the moment when a significant minority of Americans showed themselves willing to turn against American democracy itself and to use violence to achieve their ends. What has made Jan. 6 a particularly alarming stain (and strain) on U.S. democracy is the fact that the Republican Party, far from repudiating those who initiated and participated in the uprising, has sought to normalize it and purge from its own ranks those who were willing to tell the truth about the 2020 election as it looks ahead to 2024, when Mr. Trump might seek a restoration. The impact of this event is still playing out on the global stage. Over the years, authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin of Russia and Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus have sought to manipulate election results and deny popular will. Conversely, losing candidates in elections in new democracies have often charged voter fraud in the face of largely free and fair elections. This happened last year in Peru, when Keiko Fujimori contested her loss to Pedro Castillo in the second round of the country’s presidential election. Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been laying the grounds for contesting this year’s presidential election by attacking the functioning of Brazil’s voting system, just as Mr. Trump spent the lead-up to the 2020 election undermining confidence in mail-in ballots. Before Jan. 6, these kinds of antics would have been seen as the behavior of young and incompletely consolidated democracies, and the United States would have wagged its finger in condemnation. But it has now happened in the United States itself. America’s credibility in upholding a model of good democratic practice has been shredded. This precedent is bad enough, but there are potentially even more dangerous consequences of Jan. 6. The global rollback of democracy has been led by two rising authoritarian countries, Russia and China. Both powers have irredentist claims on other people’s territory. President Putin has stated openly that he does not believe Ukraine to be a legitimately independent country but rather part of a much larger Russia. He has massed troops on Ukraine’s borders and has been testing Western responses to potential aggression. President Xi of China has asserted that Taiwan must eventually return to China, and Chinese leaders have not excluded the use of military force, if necessary. A key factor in any future military aggression by either country will be the potential role of the United States, which has not extended clear security guarantees to either Ukraine or Taiwan but has been supportive militarily and ideologically aligned with those countries’ efforts to become real democracies. If momentum had built in the Republican Party to renounce the events of Jan. 6 the way it ultimately abandoned Richard Nixon in 1974, we might have hoped that the country might move on from the Trump era. But this has not happened, and foreign adversaries like Russia and China are watching this situation with unconstrained glee. If issues like vaccinations and mask-wearing have become politicized and divisive, consider how a future decision to extend military support — or to deny such support — to either Ukraine or Taiwan would be greeted. Mr. Trump undermined the bipartisan consensus that existed since the late 1940s over America’s strong support for a liberal international role, and President Biden has not yet been able to re-establish it. The single greatest weakness of the United States today lies in its internal divisions. Conservative pundits have traveled to illiberal Hungary to seek an alternative model, and a dismaying number of Republicans see the Democrats as a greater threat than Russia. The United States retains a huge amount of economic and military power, but that power is not usable in the absence of domestic political consensus over the country’s international role. If Americans cease to believe in an open, tolerant and liberal society, our capacity to innovate and lead as the world’s foremost economic power will also diminish. Jan. 6 sealed and deepened the country’s divisions, and for that reason it will have consequences echoing across the globe in the years to come."

The crisis in the oil-rich country marks the biggest challenge yet for the country’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, in power less than three years, and also threatens to destabilize an already volatile region. Mr. Tokayev requested the Russia-led intervention. The foreign soldiers were dispatched after the city hall in Almaty, the country’s largest city and former capital, was set ablaze on Wednesday, and the airport was overrun by an angry mob. Violence spread through the night. The police opened fire on the demonstrators, some of them armed, but also accused them of killing 18 law enforcement officers and troops, and leaving 750 injured. Throughout the day on Thursday, there were reports of continued clashes in Almaty, with the police saying they were “cleansing the city of militants.” Heavy gunfire echoed through the city. People hunkered in their homes posted videos of smoke billowing from buildings around the city. On Thursday night, the internal affairs ministry said it had regained control of all government buildings in Almaty. The reports of deaths could not immediately be independently confirmed. Kazakhstan, the world’s largest landlocked country, has some of the largest oil fields on earth and more than 40 percent of the world’s uranium production. But the average salary in Kazakhstan is the equivalent of $570 a month, according to the government’s statistics, and many are angry at socio-economic disparities, which have been made worse by the pandemic. The Russian-led effort to quell the unrest, described as a temporary peacekeeping mission by the military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, will be limited in time and will aim at protecting government buildings and military objects, the group said in a statement. The group has dispatched about 2,500 troops to Kazakhstan, and that figure could rise, its secretary general told the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. He would not say if they had been sent only to Almaty, or to other cities, as well. This is the first time in the history of the alliance, which is Russia’s version of NATO, that its protection clause has been invoked. Russian state-run outlets posted videos of Russian troops boarding military aircraft and others driving to Kazakhstan in armored vehicles. Saltanat Azirbek, a police spokeswoman in Almaty, said that dozens of people had been “eliminated” by the authorities when they tried to storm government buildings and the headquarters and district offices of the police, the first widespread fatalities since the protests started.  The authorities reported that in addition to those who had been killed, about a thousand people had been injured and up to 400 had been hospitalized. By Thursday, around 2,000 people had been detained in Almaty, the Kazakh interior ministry said in a statement read out on state television. Two of the members of the security staff that were killed had been beheaded, Almaty’s commandant’s office said in a statement carried by Khabar-24, Kazakhstan’s state news channel. The protesters also surrounded two hospitals in the city, the statement said. The police warned people living near main government buildings to stay at home. The Biden administration is closely watching Moscow’s military intervention in Kazakhstan, a Russian neighbor and former Soviet republic that Washington has cultivated as a friendly partner in recent years. U.S. officials see President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia’s response to the crisis as a test of his ability and determination to maintain a Russian sphere of influence in neighboring countries. Mr. Putin has warned against deepening Western involvement in Ukraine, and has massed troops along Ukraine’s eastern border for what American officials warn is a potential invasion of that country. Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, requested the troop deployment by a Russian-led alliance to help put down the uprising in his country. “We have questions about the nature of this request and whether it was a legitimate invitation or not. We don’t know at this point,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday. The State Department spokesman, Ned Price, noted in a separate press briefing that the Kazakh government has ample resources and is “well fortified,” but he said the U.S. would “defer” to the Kazakh government to explain its request for help. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke on Thursday morning with his Kazakh counterpart, Mukhtar Tileuberdi, the State Department said, and “reiterated the United States’ full support for Kazakhstan’s constitutional institutions and media freedom and advocated for a peaceful, rights-respecting resolution to the crisis,” the State Department said in a statement. Mr. Price also said on Thursday that the U.S. condemns acts of violence and destruction of property, and urged protesters “to express their grievances peacefully and for authorities to respond with restraint in order to seek a rights-respecting resolution to the crisis.” He added that the U.S. will watch closely for potential human rights violations, and what he called “any actions that may lay the predicate for the seizure of Kazakh institutions.” He also called on the government to restore internet service in the country. Among the Central Asian former Soviet Republics, Kazakhstan has been the friendliest country with Washington, a bond formed thanks to major energy investments by American corporations and the cooperation of the former Khazak president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, with the United States on nuclear nonproliferation. Mr. Nazarbayev also supported the American military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Kremlin blamed foreign influence for the unrest, but didn’t point to a particular country. In the past, Russia has accused the United States of fomenting protests in Ukraine and Georgia. “We consider the recent events in a friendly country to be a foreign-inspired attempt to use armed and trained groups of people forcibly to undermine the security and integrity of the state,” the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said in a statement, according to the Russian news outlet Sputnik. John R. Bolton, who served as national security adviser in the Trump White House, wrote on Twitter Thursday that Mr. Putin’s intervention in Kazakhstan was evidence that President Biden lacks a successful strategy for dealing with the Russian leader. “Putin is on the march, today in Kazakhstan. Are Belarus or Ukraine next? Biden’s ‘relentless diplomacy’ with Putin is failing,” Mr. Bolton said. Kazakhstan has long been regarded one of the most successful post-Soviet states. It has by far the highest G.D.P. per capita in the region and plenty of reserves, driven by billions in profits derived from its oil-rich western region. Most of this wealth, however, has not been equally distributed, with the elites living lavishly while many others survive on meager salaries and are left to complain in vain about widespread government corruption. Still, the scale of protests rocking the country has caught most Central Asian observers off guard.  According to Vladislav Inozemtsev, an analyst of post-Soviet affairs and special adviser to Russian Media Studies Project, the situation in Kazakhstan is a warning for the Kremlin: Under a surface appearance of stability, a pool of discontent might be brewing that could explode at any moment. “In Russia, the government must realize that 10 years without economic growth cannot make the population happy,” said Mr. Inozemtsev. “No geopolitical adventures can rescue it if the Kremlin doesn’t offer a mechanism that would increase the standards of living.” Another lesson of this week’s protests, Mr. Inozemtsev said, was that succession creates turbulence in authoritarian systems. In 2019, Mr. Tokayev formally succeeded Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan’s longtime president. But Mr. Nazarbayev continued to wield power. Mr. Nazarbayev handpicked Mr. Tokayev, whose first order of business was to rename the country’s capital in his predecessor’s honor. However, the new arrangement left the country’s bureaucracy disoriented.  On Wednesday, Mr. Tokayev appeared to be trying to use the unrest to consolidate power. He dismissed Mr. Nazarbayev from his post as chairman of the country’s Security Council, and also removed Mr. Nazarbayev’s nephew as deputy head of the main security service. All night and into the day on Thursday, young men roamed the streets of Kazakhstan’s largest city, Almaty, flanked by flames and buttressed by barricades. As stun grenades exploded and tear gas wafted in the air, demonstrators set fire to trucks, police cars and other vehicles, their smoldering hulks littering the streets. The first foreign soldiers from countries led by Russia landed in the Central Asian nation and found a land that had, for the moment, been plunged into anarchy. Some protesters came with firearms and started looting shops and malls, according to video footage posted from the scene. They set government buildings on fire, including the City Hall and the former office of the country’s president. They also captured the airport. Security forces responded with force, gunfire rattled the city throughout the day, and there were reports of dozens of people killed. On Thursday night, the government claimed to have retaken control of all official buildings in Almaty. The scale of the violence, which was evident in videos, postings on social media and official government statements, was still coming into focus on Thursday as unconfirmed reports of continued, sporadic clashes circulated on social media. With intermittent internet access and few independent witnesses, information coming out of the country was hard to verify. Galym Ageleulov, who has witnessed the events of the past few days, said he believed that a protest movement that was calling for peaceful change had been co-opted by throngs of criminals. Overnight, the streets were filled with mostly young men, many posing on social media with riot shields and helmets captured from the police. They were highly organized and managed by gang leaders, he said. “The police have disappeared from the city,” said Mr. Ageleulov, director of the human rights center Liberty in Almaty. “These gang members marched through the city looting stores and setting cars ablaze as they moved; they stormed the City Hall,” he said in a phone interview. “It was a horrible scene,” he said. By the morning, Almaty had been transformed: Commercial banks were ordered closed with many Kazakhs rushing to A.T.M.s desperate to withdraw cash; stores were closed, causing many residents to line up for bread, a scene unseen in the country for decades; at times, the internet has been shut down, disrupting basic infrastructure work. Almaty’s City Hall, an imposing white building that once served as the Communist Party headquarters, was charred black from the flames that burned through the night. Members of the special forces roamed the surrounding streets firing live ammunition trying to quell the uprising. The revolt began on Sunday in western Kazakhstan as a protest against a surge in fuel prices. Even though the government said it would rescind the price increase, the protests widened, spreading across the country, with broader demands for increased political representation and improved social benefits. The Kazakh president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, issued a statement late Wednesday night calling the protesters “a band of terrorists” who had been trained abroad. He declared Kazakhstan to be under attack and asked for intervention from Russia’s answer to NATO, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, to which his country belongs. The group is effectively led by Russia and also includes former Soviet countries in the Kremlin sphere of influence: Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The protests have paralyzed a nation of 19 million. In addition to the bank closures and internet shutdowns, the telephone system has been shut off sporadically, schools have extended their winter break by a week and flights in and out of airports in the cities of Almaty, Aktau and Aktobe have been suspended. Kazakhstan, where violent protests against the government have been raging, has some of the largest oil fields on earth and more than 40 percent of the world’s uranium production. So far the unrest does not seem to have cut into production of either oil or uranium, but it has the potential to ripple through critical energy markets. Uranium prices, which have risen in recent months on hopes of a revival of the nuclear industry to combat climate change, rose 8 percent on Wednesday amid reports of clashes in the Central Asian country. Some 22 percent of the uranium purchased by nuclear plants in the United States in 2020 came from Kazakhstan, according to U.S. government statistics. “Without Kazakhstan right now, the world would not be anywhere near well-supplied for uranium,” said Jonathan Hinze, president of UxC, which tracks the market, though he noted that utilities buy the fuel with long lead times. Any drop in oil output from Kazakhstan, which produces about 2 percent of world supplies, would also likely be felt in an already tight market. Some oil producers are not meeting the quotas allocated to them under agreements by the so-called OPEC Plus producers group. Kazakhstan, a member of the group, has been substantially exceeding its quota and is one of the few producers that looked likely to be able to increase output in the coming months. Oil prices jumped more than 2 percent on Thursday in futures trading on global markets, in part reflecting concerns about Kazakh unrest. “This is the sort of supply risk that has not been on anybody’s radar screen,” said Bill Farren-Price, director for intelligence at Enverus, an energy research firm. He added that oil analysts had mostly focused on problems elsewhere, including tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and recent cuts in production in Libya because of political turmoil. Since becoming independent with the fall of the Soviet Union three decades ago, Kazakhstan has been a magnet for Western energy investment. The Tengiz oil field, in the western part of the country near the Caspian Sea, is one of the world’s largest. Chevron and Exxon Mobil, the two largest American oil companies, are in the midst of an estimated $37 billion expansion at Tengiz field, which is a critical source of earnings for Chevron. Exxon, Shell, France’s Total, and Italy’s Eni are all shareholders in another huge field called Kashagan in the Caspian. These fields have helped make Kazakhstan a substantial oil producer, pumping about 1.6 million barrels a day (more than Nigeria, comparable to Mexico) and one of the few that is growing. The oil operations are also a crucial source of revenue for the Kazakh government. The fields are in remote areas, but oil workers have demonstrated at the Chevron-operated Tengiz field in sympathy with the protests. “A number of contractor employees are gathered at the Tengiz field in support of protests taking place across Kazakhstan,” said a statement on Thursday from Tengizchevroil, the Chevron-led joint venture in the country. It added, “Production operations continue.” Mr. Farren-Price said that the locations of these fields would tend to insulate them from disruption. But if the unrest gains momentum, he said, the oil companies might encounter operating problems, like difficulties moving people and supplies in and out of the sites.  The widespread disorder could also hurt Kazakhstan’s prospects for investment and credit. In a comment on Thursday, Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating group, attributed the civil unrest to what it called “structural weaknesses” in Kazakhstan’s institutions. The agency said that government policy was subject to what it called “succession risk,” with the longtime leader Nursultan Nazarbayev having been succeeded by another strongman, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, in 2019, and noted that “perceived corruption is high.” Central Asian governments have cracked down on previous popular uprisings with unflinching brutality in episodes that carry geopolitical consequences more than a decade later.  In Uzbekistan in 2005, security forces opened fire on crowds in the city of Andijan. In that incident, an Islamic opposition group called Akramia — named for its founder Akram Yuldashev — seized government buildings and released detainees from a prison. Soldiers surrounded a group protesting on a city square, then opened fire. The final toll is disputed. The president of Uzbekistan at the time, Islam Karimov, acknowledged 187 deaths. Human rights groups put the toll at around 750. Mr. Karimov retained power after the uprising. But the violence steered Uzbekistan more firmly into Russia’s orbit, as Russia largely backed Mr. Karimov while the United States criticized the shootings. In the wake of the American criticism, Mr. Karimov expelled the U.S. military from a logistics base in the country supporting the war effort in Afghanistan. In another mass shooting in Kyrgyzstan in 2010, protests that began in a regional city spread quickly to the capital, Bishkek. A crowd gathered outside the presidential office. The police opened fire but failed to control protesters who climbed over a security fence. The president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, fled the capital and within days was deposed. The new government estimated the death toll at 88 protesters. In that instance, the shootings tainted the United States’ standing in Kyrgyzstan; Washington was seen as supportive of Mr. Bakiyev despite troubling signs of corruption because his government provided access to an airfield and base used by the U.S. military to fly troops into Afghanistan. Sandwiched between Russia and China, Kazakhstan is the world’s largest landlocked country, bigger than the whole of Western Europe, though with a population of just 19 million. The latest demonstrations matter because the country has been regarded until now as a pillar of political and economic stability in an unstable region, even as that stability has come at the price of a repressive government that stifles dissent. The protests are also significant as Kazakhstan has been aligned with Russia, whose president, Vladimir V. Putin, views the country — a body double of sorts for Russia in terms of its economic and political systems — as part of Russia’s sphere of influence. For the Kremlin, the events represent another possible challenge to autocratic power in a neighboring country. This is yet another uprising against an authoritarian, Kremlin-aligned nation, following pro-democracy protests in Ukraine in 2014 and in Belarus in 2020. The chaos threatens to undermine Moscow’s sway in the region at a time when Russia is trying to assert its economic and geopolitical power in countries like Ukraine and Belarus. The countries of the former Soviet Union are also watching the protests closely, and the events in Kazakhstan could help energize opposition forces elsewhere. Kazakhstan also matters to the United States, because it has become a significant country for American energy concerns, with Exxon Mobil and Chevron having invested tens of billions of dollars in western Kazakhstan, the region where the unrest began this month. Although it has close ties with Moscow, consecutive Kazakh governments have also maintained close links to the United States, with oil investment seen as a counterweight to Russian influence. The United States government has long been less critical of post-Soviet authoritarianism in Kazakhstan than in Russia and Belarus."

The two harmful pollutants are a result of worsening wildfires and extreme heat, and researchers suggest the increase is linked to climate change. “These trends are congruent with what you would expect with a warming and drying climate,” said Dmitri A. Kalashnikov, a doctoral student at Washington State University Vancouver and the lead author of a study that analyzed summer air pollution data from 2000 to 2020. “We would expect to see more of these kinds of widespread co-occurring air pollution events in the Western U.S.” Surface-level ozone is a large component of smog, and is produced when vehicle and other emissions react with sunlight, especially on hot summer days. Smoke contains fine soot particles, and much of this kind of pollution, called PM2.5 because it is smaller than 2.5 micrometers, comes from wildfires. High levels of either pollutant can affect the lungs and cardiovascular system, aggravate chronic diseases like asthma and lead to premature death. “But when they both occur at once, then you’re getting the worst of both worlds,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and another author of the study, which was published in Science Advances. Dr. Swain said the idea for the research came about through discussions among colleagues. “All of us live in the West and all of us have experienced, along with everyone else, these extreme wildfire smoke episodes in recent years,” he said. And it seemed possible that more days of extreme smoke would coincide with days of high ozone. “So we really just said, OK, but to what extent is this actually the case?” he said. The researchers looked at simultaneous occurrences of high levels of both smoke and ozone and linked the geographic extent of these events to the extent of wildfires and extreme hot weather. Overall, the study found that between 2000 and 2020, millions of people in the Western United States were exposed to more days of combined harmful smoke and ozone pollution each year. The researchers also found a connection between the pollution and patterns of atmospheric “ridging,” the development of stagnant zones of high-pressure air. These zones, sometimes called heat domes, lead to increasing heat and drying that can cause wildfires to ignite and spread more readily, and can also cause dangerous heat waves. The frequency of these ridging patterns has increased significantly since 2000, according to the new research. The study analyzed data only through 2020. “But I think 2021 would show up pretty high on some of these metrics, too,” Mr. Kalashnikov said. There were several enormous wildfires in the West last summer that spread smoke across the West, and extreme heat and drought persisted throughout the region. Colleen Reid, a health geographer at the University of Colorado who has studied the combined effects of wildfire smoke and ozone but was not involved in this research, said the findings showed that the seasonality and extent of PM2.5 pollution in the West is changing and now overlapping more with high-ozone days. “What has been happening a lot lately is that we’ve been having really bad air quality as well as extreme heat,” she said. Dr. Reid said the study also highlights how heat has to be taken into account when it comes to helping the public cope with air pollution, because the recommended public health measures for extreme heat and extreme air pollution can be completely opposite, especially for those who cannot afford air conditioning. “When it’s hot, you want to open your windows so that you don’t overheat in your home,” Dr. Reid said. “But when the air quality is bad, you want to close your windows to keep as much of the air pollution out.” Dr. Swain said that with wildfires, the short-term dangers to individuals and communities usually get the most attention. But this study looks at the longer-term risks to the broader public. “Something may not necessarily have a high likelihood of killing you personally in the short term,” he said. “But if you impose that same risk on tens of millions of people over and over again, the societal burden is actually very high.”"

It was in a dented aluminum canister. Florida’s heat and humidity had nearly solidified the celluloid into a mass “like a hockey puck,” Kurtz said. But someone had transferred part of it onto VHS tape in the 1980s, so Kurtz could see what it contained: a home movie titled “Our Trip to Holland, Belgium, Poland, Switzerland, France and England, 1938.” The 16-millimeter film, made by his grandfather, David Kurtz, on the eve of World War II, showed the Alps, quaint Dutch villages and three minutes of footage of a vibrant Jewish community in a Polish town. Old men in yarmulkes, skinny boys in caps, girls with long braids. Smiling and joking. People pour through the large doors of a synagogue. There’s some shoving in a cafe and then, that’s it. The footage ends abruptly. Kurtz, nevertheless, understood the value of the material as evidence of Jewish life in Poland just before the Holocaust. It would take him nearly a year to figure it out, but he discovered that the footage depicted Nasielsk, his grandfather’s birthplace, a town about 30 miles northwest of Warsaw that some 3,000 Jews called home before the war. Fewer than 100 would survive it. Now, the Dutch filmmaker Bianca Stigter has used the fragmentary, ephemeral footage to create “Three Minutes: A Lengthening,” a 70-minute feature film that helps to further define what and who were lost. “It’s a short piece of footage, but it’s amazing how much it yields,” Stigter said in an interview in Amsterdam recently. “Every time I see it, I see something I haven’t really seen before. I must have seen it thousands and thousands of times, but still, I can always see a detail that has escaped my attention before.” Almost as unusual as the footage is the journey it took before gaining wider exposure. All but forgotten within his family, the videotape was transferred to DVD and sent to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington in 2009. “We knew it was unique,” said Leslie Swift, chief of the film, oral history and recorded sound branch of the museum. “I immediately communicated with him and said, ‘If you have the original film, that’s what we want.’” The Holocaust museum was able to restore and digitize the film, and it posted the footage on its website. At the time, Kurtz didn’t know where it had been shot, nor did he know the names of any of the people in the town square. His grandfather had emigrated from Poland to the United States as a child and had died before he was born. Thus began a four-year process of detective work, which led Kurtz to write an acclaimed book, “Three Minutes in Poland: Discovering a Lost World in a 1938 Family Film,” published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 2014. Stigter relied on the book in completing the film, which is co-produced by her husband, Steve McQueen, the British artist and Academy Award-winning director of “12 Years a Slave,” and narrated by Helena Bonham Carter. It has garnered attention in documentary circles and has been screened at Giornate degli Autori, an independent film festival held in parallel with the Venice film fest; the Toronto International Film Festival; Telluride Film Festival; the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam; and DOC NYC. It was recently selected for this month’s Sundance Film Festival. Nasielsk, which had been home to Jews for centuries, was overtaken on Sept. 4, 1939, three days after the German invasion of Poland. Three months later, on Dec. 3, the entire Jewish population was rounded up and expelled. People were forced into cattle cars, and traveled for days without food and water, to the towns of Lukow and Miedzyrzec, in the Lublin region of Nazi-occupied Poland. From there, they were mostly deported to the Treblinka extermination camp. “When you see it, you want to scream to these people run away, go, go, go,” Stigter said. “We know what happens and they obviously don’t know what starts to happen, just a year later. That puts a tremendous pressure on those images. It is inescapable.” Stigter stumbled across the footage on Facebook in 2014 and found it instantly mesmerizing, especially because much of it was shot in color. “My first idea was just to prolong the experience of seeing these people,” she said. “For me, it was very clear, especially with the children, that they wanted to be seen. They really look at you; they try to stay in the camera’s frame.” A historian, author and film critic for a Dutch national newspaper, NRC Handelsblad, Stigter worked on this film, her directorial debut, for five years. She started it after the International Film Festival Rotterdam invited her to produce a short video essay for its Critic’s Choice program. Instead of choosing a feature film, she decided to explore this found footage. After making a 25-minute “filmic essay,” shown at the Rotterdam festival in 2015, she received support to expand it into a feature film. “Three Minutes: A Lengthening” never steps out of the footage. Viewers never see the town of Nasielsk as it is today, or the faces of the interviewees as talking heads. Stigter tracks out, zooms in, stops, rewinds; she homes in on the cobblestones of a square, on the types of caps worn by the boys, and on the buttons of jackets and shirts, which were made in a nearby factory owned by Jews. She creates still portraits of each of the 150 faces — no matter how vague or blurry — and puts names to some of them. Maurice Chandler, a Nasielsk survivor who is in his 90s, is one of the smiling teenage boys in the footage. He was identified after a granddaughter in Detroit recognized him in a digitized clip on the Holocaust museum’s website. Chandler, who was born Moszek Tuchendler, lost his entire family in the Holocaust; he said the footage helped him recall a lost childhood. He joked that he could finally prove to his children and grandchildren “that I’m not from Mars.” He was also able to help identify seven other people in the film. Kurtz, an author and journalist, had discovered a tremendous amount through his own research, but Stigter helped solve some additional mysteries. He couldn’t decipher the name on a grocery store sign, because it was too blurry to read. Stigter found a Polish researcher who figured out the name, one possible clue to the identity of the woman standing in the doorway. Leslie Swift said that the David Kurtz footage is one of the “more often requested films” from the Holocaust Museum’s moving picture archives, but most often it is used by documentary filmmakers as stock footage, or background imagery, to indicate prewar Jewish life in Poland “in a generic way,” she said. What Kurtz’s book, and Stigter’s documentary do, by contrast, is to explore the material itself to answer the question “What am I seeing?” over and over again, she said. By identifying people and details of the life of this community, they manage to restore humanity and individuality. “We had to work as archaeologists to extract as much information out of this movie as possible,” Stigter said. “What’s interesting is that, at a certain moment you say, ‘we can’t go any further; this is where it stops.’ But then you discover something else.”"

Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of the capital region of Delhi, swiftly introduced night curfews, shut down movie theaters, and slashed restaurants and public transport to half capacity. Then, both men hit the campaign trail, often appearing without masks in packed rallies of thousands. “When it is our bread and butter at stake, they force restrictions and lockdowns,” said Ajay Tiwari, a 41-year-old taxi driver in New Delhi. “There are much bigger crowds at political rallies, but they don’t impose any lockdown in those areas. It really pains us deep in the heart.” As Omicron fuels a rapid spread of new infections through India’s major urban hubs, the country’s pandemic fatigue has been intensified by a sense of déjà vu and the frustration of mixed signals. It has been just a few months since the deadly Delta variant ravaged the country, when government leaders vastly underestimated its threat and publicly flouted their own advice. The memories of overwhelmed hospitals and funeral pyres working around the clock are still all too fresh here. The metropolis of Mumbai on Wednesday reported more than 15,000 new infections in 24 hours — the highest daily caseload since the pandemic began, beating the city’s previous record of about 11,000 cases during the second wave in the spring. In New Delhi, the number of daily infections increased by nearly 100 percent overnight. The sheer size of India’s population, at 1.4 billion, has always kept experts wary about the prospects of a new coronavirus variant. In few places around the world was the toll of Delta as stark as in India. The country’s official figures show about half a million pandemic deaths — a number that experts say vastly undercounts the real toll. Omicron’s high transmissibility is such that cases are multiplying at a dangerously rapid pace, and it appears to be ignoring India’s main line of defense: a vaccination drive that has covered about half of the population. Initial studies show that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, a locally manufactured version of which has been used for about 90 percent of India’s vaccinations, does not protect against Omicron infections, though it appears to help reduce the severity of the illness. Sitabhra Sinha, a professor of physics and computational biology at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Chennai, said his research into the reproduction rate of the virus — an indicator of how fast it is spreading that is called the “R value” — in major cities like Delhi and Mumbai shows “insanely high” numbers for cities that had built decent immunity. Both had a large number of infections in the spring, and a majority of their adult populations have been vaccinated. “Given this high R value, one is looking at incredibly large numbers unless something is done to stop the spread,” he said. But officials appear to be latching onto the optimism of the early indications from places like South Africa, where a fast spread of the variant did not cause devastating damage, rather than drawing lessons from the botched response to the Delta wave in the spring that ravaged India. Dr. Anand Krishnan, a professor of epidemiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, said India’s messaging of the new variant as “a mild illness” has led to complacency. “The health system has stopped being complacent. But the population is complacent. People are not wearing masks or changing their behavior,” Dr. Krishnan said. “They think it is a mild illness, and whatever restrictions are being imposed are seen more as a nuisance than necessary.” Scientists say any optimism about Omicron is premature simply because of how many people the variant could infect. “Even if it is a microscopic percentage who require hospitalization,” Dr. Sinha said, “the fact is that the total population we’re talking about is huge.” Although the percentage of newly infected people turning to hospitals has been increasing in recent days, data from India’s worst-hit cities — Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata — showed that only a small number of Covid-designated beds were occupied so far. Data compiled by the Observer Research Foundation showed that about three percent of the known active cases in Delhi and about 12 percent in Mumbai have required hospitalization. Dr. J. A. Jayalal, until recently the president of The Indian Medical Association, said what worried him was not hospital beds or oxygen running out — capacity that Indian officials have been trying to expand after the deadly shortfalls during the Delta wave — but that the health system might face an acute shortfall of health workers. About 1,800 Indian doctors are known to have died from Covid-19 since the pandemic began, Dr. Jayalal said. Health workers are struggling with pandemic fatigue. Tens of thousands of doctors only recently called off a strike protesting being overworked and a delay in recruiting new doctors. Reports in local media suggest hundreds of doctors and medical workers have tested positive in recent days. “In our medical fraternity, a lot of positive cases have been reported. That means they will not be available for work,” Dr. Jayalal said. “The problem with mild infections is that they may not come to a major hospital for admission, but they will still go to their family doctor or a general practitioner,” putting those doctors at risk of infection, he added. As with the Delta wave, Omicron is spreading in India at a time of high public activity — busy holiday travel, and large election rallies across several states that are going to the polls in the coming months. Prime Minister Modi and his lieutenants have been holding large rallies in Uttar Pradesh, the state of 200 million people run by a Modi protégé who is up for re-election. Mr. Kejriwal, the chief minister of Delhi and a prominent opposition leader, has also been a ubiquitous figure at rallies. He has been trying to expand his small party in the several states that are up for elections this year. Even as he put Delhi under restrictions, he continued campaigning in those states. A day after a large rally in the state of Uttarakhand where Mr. Kejriwal appeared on stage without a mask, he had some bad news to share on Twitter. “I have tested positive for Covid,” he said. “Those who came in touch with me in last few days, kindly isolate.” Hours later, his party’s Facebook page put out new instructions to residents of Delhi with a poster bearing Mr. Kejriwal’s picture. “The war against corona continues,” it said. “WEEKEND CURFEW announced in Delhi.”"

Esa no es la misión principal del comité que planea redactar un informe exhaustivo sobre el origen de la violencia del 6 de enero y, al mismo tiempo, realizar recomendaciones para evitar que algo parecido vuelva a ocurrir. Sin embargo, mientras el comité y sus decenas de investigadores emiten citatorios para obtener documentos, registros telefónicos y registros bancarios, el panel busca pruebas de criminalidad que el Departamento de Justicia tal vez no haya descubierto. A continuación, analizamos algunos de los problemas que enfrenta el comité. Una remisión penal del Congreso simplemente sería una recomendación para que el Departamento de Justicia investigue un caso. No tendría ningún peso legal, pues el Congreso no tiene autoridad para ordenarles a los fiscales federales qué cargos deben presentar. Sin embargo, como el equipo del comité que estudia el ataque del 6 de enero está liderado por un par bipartidista de exfiscales estadounidenses, lo más probable es que los fiscales federales se tomen en serio cualquier recomendación que realicen. Una recomendación también podría tener un efecto político significativo, pues aumentaría la presión pública sobre el fiscal general Merrick Garland, quien en su mayor parte ha eludido los cuestionamientos sobre la labor de los fiscales para examinar la conducta de Trump y sus asistentes cuando estos últimos promovieron alegatos sin fundamentos sobre un fraude electoral. No obstante, al menos en el caso de un delito, la recomendación del Congreso sí conlleva un ordenamiento jurídico. Si la Cámara de Representantes vota que encontró a alguien culpable de cometer un desacato en contra del Congreso, el Departamento de Justicia debe llevar el caso ante un gran jurado. Los investigadores intentan determinar si se cometieron una serie de delitos, incluido el posible fraude electrónico de los republicanos que recaudaron millones de dólares promoviendo aseveraciones de que la elección presidencial de 2020 fue robada, a pesar de saber que esas afirmaciones no eran ciertas. Mientras los investigadores escudriñan esos esfuerzos de recaudación de fondos, están examinando si se violó alguna de las leyes o regulaciones de financiamiento de campañas que rigen cómo pueden gastar su dinero las organizaciones sin fines de lucro. El comité también intenta determinar si Trump y sus aliados obstruyeron al Congreso al intentar detener la certificación de los votos electorales. Liz Cheney, representante republicana por Wyoming y vicepresidenta del comité, ha sugerido que Trump pudo haber incurrido “por acción o inacción” en un cargo de obstrucción que los fiscales federales han usado para procesar a los alborotadores del ataque al Capitolio ocurrido el 6 de enero: la perturbación de las labores del Congreso para certificar la etapa final de una elección presidencial. Formular un cargo penal por “inacción” de un presidente sería una nueva estrategia legal. Para todos los miembros de alto rango del gobierno federal que sean acusados según una teoría legal de ese tipo, los fiscales tendrían que establecer que el funcionario tenía una labor específica que le permitía actuar para restaurar el orden que se había violado. Christopher C. Miller, quien era el secretario de Defensa interino el 6 de enero, ha testificado ante el Congreso que Trump no lo llamó durante el ataque, pero dijo que el vicepresidente Mike Pence sí lo llamó y le pidió que ejército despejara el Capitolio. Miller señaló que no era necesaria una llamada de Trump porque “tenía toda la autoridad que necesitaba” para desplegar a la Guardia Nacional. “En términos generales, las omisiones no son delitos”, comentó David Alan Sklansky, profesor de Derecho y codirector del Centro de Justicia Penal de la Universidad de Stanford. “Pero puede tratarse de un delito cuando alguien tiene un deber particular. Por lo tanto, si estamos hablando de un funcionario de Estados Unidos que está encargado de una tarea y no la realiza, y al no hacerla provoca una interferencia con la capacidad del Congreso para realizar su trabajo, eso sería un delito”. El comité también podría presentar casos como mentir bajo juramento, intimidación de testigos o desacato al Congreso en contra de testigos que obstruyan sus citatorios. La Cámara de Representantes ya ha votado para enviarle al Departamento de Justicia dos recomendaciones de desacato al Congreso en contra del exestratega de Trump, Stephen Bannon, y su exjefe de personal Mark Meadows. Un gran jurado ya acusó formalmente a Bannon, pero todavía no ha tomado una decisión en el caso de Meadows. Esta semana, Cheney señaló que creía que el 6 de enero Trump fue negligente en el cumplimiento de su deber a nivel moral y ético, pues tardó horas en divulgar un video para que se detuviera la violencia de la muchedumbre. “Una de las cosas en las que se debe fijar el comité es si necesitamos mejorar los castigos para ese tipo de negligencia en el cumplimiento del deber”, dijo Cheney en This Week de ABC. Cheney no estaba sugiriendo una acusación específica de “negligencia en el cumplimiento del deber” en contra de Trump, comentó un vocero de la representante. (Luego añadió que Cheney no ha descartado explorar cualquier vía legal). Más bien, la representante cree que el comité debería explorar si debe recomendar cambios a las leyes actuales que pudieran responsabilizar a un futuro presidente. Cheney también quiere que el público esté consciente de cómo fue que Trump esperó horas para disuadir a la muchedumbre, según la oficina de la representante. Aunque buscar cargos penales es el papel del Departamento de Justicia, el comité tiene un sólido equipo que podría descubrir evidencias mientras está en funciones. Con más de 40 miembros realizando la investigación, entre ellos exfiscales federales, el panel ha entrevistado a más de 300 testigos y ha obtenido más de 35.000 documentos. “Si encuentran pruebas de algo que perciben como un delito y creen que el Departamento de Justicia debería considerar iniciar un proceso, me parece totalmente apropiado que lo hagan saber”, comentó Sklansky. Si el comité decide hacer la remisión, el caso quedará en manos del Departamento de Justicia, donde los fiscales determinarán si hay una causa probable de que ocurrió un delito y evaluarán su capacidad para demostrar el caso más allá de una duda razonable. Garland testificó ante el Congreso en octubre y dijo que, mientras analiza el ataque del 6 de enero, el departamento no limita sus investigaciones a los alborotadores. A pesar de esto, dijo que no podía comentar más sobre los siguientes pasos de la agencia. “Tengo muchas limitaciones sobre lo que puedo decir”, dijo Garland. “Esta investigación está en manos de la fiscalía general de Estados Unidos y la oficina de campo del FBI. No los hemos restringido de ninguna manera”."

As the contagious Omicron variant spreads through the country, public health officials have seized on extra vaccine doses as a first line of defense. Pfizer-BioNTech boosters are now authorized for any American older than 12 who is five months past his or her second dose of the vaccine. An advisory committee recommended the changes following a meeting on Wednesday. They were endorsed by Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director, on Wednesday night. Adolescents ages 12 to 15 may begin to receive boosters immediately. Adolescents ages 16 and older were already permitted to receive booster shots, but on Wednesday the C.D.C. panel strengthened the recommendation. The advisory panel followed a similar move earlier this week by the Food and Drug Administration, which authorized Pfizer-BioNtech boosters for adolescents and shortened the recommended time interval between the initial vaccine regimen and the booster. The F.D.A. also endorsed “an additional primary dose” of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for moderately or severely immunocompromised children aged 5 to 11, to be given 28 days after their second shots.  Studies suggest that vaccine side effects are minimal in children, although there is lingering concern about a link to myocarditis, a rare inflammation of the heart muscle that occurs more frequently in young men, following vaccination. In Israel, which started administering boosters to adolescents aged 12 to 15 in June and rigorously tracks side effects, the health ministry identified two cases of myocarditis, among some 41,600 adolescents in this age group who received the booster. Both children were hospitalized briefly and have fully recovered, said Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, an Israeli health official who addressed the committee. The booster dramatically reduced infection rates among children aged 12 to 15, Dr. Alroy-Preis said. Although most infected youngsters generally did not experience severe Covid disease that required hospitalization, two children — one boy and one girl — have died, she said. But while much of the committee’s discussion focused on the risks of the vaccine and its side effects, Dr. Camille Kotton, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who specializes in transplant and immunocompromised patients, said the focus should be on the disease itself, which is having a devastating effect on vulnerable and immunocompromised patients. “This is an important thing to think about — the risk of myocarditis from the disease itself,” Dr. Kotton said. Though Omicron is generally perceived as causing less severe disease, she said, she now sees numerous patients on life support. Some have died. “It’s a horrible state of affairs,” she said. “The highly infectious nature of Omicron is such that patients who have been incredibly careful the last two years have been getting infected with awful outcomes.” Dr. Katherine Poehling, director of pediatric population health at Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., expressed similar sentiments. “There are children waiting in the emergency department 18 hours and longer to get into the hospital because we’re so full,” she said. “We have parents asking us can their children get a booster dose, like older children.” But several committee members said they were increasingly disturbed that only a minority of younger children are getting vaccinated at all, and said it is critical to increase the rates and adhere to other prevention strategies, like masking. “We can’t put all of the burden on the people who are willing to get vaccinated,” said Lynn Bahta, a committee member who is a registered nurse with the Minnesota Department of Health. “When we have only half our adolescents vaccinated, that adds more burden as well. I am so concerned that the burden of disease prevention is all falling on the vaccinated and them getting the boosters.” More than 70 percent of people 12 and older in the United States are fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C. Children younger than age 5 are still not eligible for vaccination. Americans aged 18 and older who received Moderna’s vaccine can get a booster of any available coronavirus vaccine six months after the second shot. Those who received Johnson & Johnson’s single-shot vaccine may get a booster dose of any available vaccine two months after their first shot. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are both strongly preferred over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the C.D.C. has said. Only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is authorized for children ages 5 to 11; boosters are not yet recommended for this group. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday said it was not changing its definition of “full vaccination” against the coronavirus. But the agency changed its emphasis on the appropriate regimen, tweaking how it referred to the shots. The agency said that three doses of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna’s vaccines should be considered “up-to-date” inoculations, and that Johnson & Johnson recipients should receive a second dose, preferably of Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech, to also be considered up to date. The move amounted to a recommendation from federal health officials that Americans should change how they talk about vaccination schedules. People 12 years and older are eligible for boosters. “Consistent with how public health has historically viewed or even talked about how we recommend vaccines, we are now recommending that individuals stay up to date with additional doses that they are eligible for,” Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, said at a White House news briefing on Wednesday. The C.D.C. did not change the definition of what qualifies as full vaccination — a subject of intense interest to corporations, schools, state health departments and professional sports leagues, which have themselves been reconsidering what it means to be fully vaccinated. “The technical definition of ‘fully vaccinated’ — two doses of an mRNA vaccine or one dose of the J & J vaccine — has not changed,” Kristen Nordlund, a C.D.C. spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Individuals are considered fully vaccinated once they have received their primary series.” She added that the agency recommend that people “stay ‘up to date’ by receiving any additional doses they are eligible for, according to C.D.C.’s recommendations, to ensure they have optimal protection.” Parents across Chicago raced to find child care on Wednesday morning after jarring news: Classes in the nation’s third-largest public school district were canceled. The teachers’ union and Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration had failed to agree on how to keep schools open during an Omicron-fueled virus surge. Across the country, the wildly contagious Omicron variant has infected millions and complicated the return to classrooms and workplaces. But nowhere has returning to school been more acrimonious and unpredictable than in Chicago, where, after two days back in classrooms following winter break, 73 percent of teachers voted to stop reporting to work. The city responded by calling off school altogether, refusing the teachers’ call for remote instruction. With no deal reached by Wednesday evening, district officials said classes would be canceled again on Thursday. The abrupt pause in the academic calendar, rooted in years of enmity between the Chicago Teachers Union and City Hall, jumbled plans for hundreds of thousands of students and posed another major test for Ms. Lightfoot, a Democrat whose tenure has been marked by labor strife, the pandemic and a surge in homicides. “If they are in class and Covid is rampaging, that’s a problem. If they are not there and out on the streets, that’s a problem,” said Tamar Manasseh, who leads an anti-violence group in the city, and who said she was looking into ways to help children with nowhere to go during the day. “This has put us in an untenable situation.” Ms. Lightfoot, whose disagreements with the Chicago Teachers Union date back to a strike in the early months of her term, said in an interview that the two sides remained far apart as negotiations continued. Ms. Lightfoot said she intended to take legal action against the union, and on Monday evening said the city had filed an unfair labor practices complaint. The school district opened buildings for meal distribution on Wednesday and published a list of places where parents could get emergency child care. “The consequences of the union acting like this time and time again are profound,” Ms. Lightfoot said. She added, “You think about the consequences for the families to be faced with the hostage choice of either going to work or taking care of their kids and home-schooling — no parent should be put in that position.” Australia blocked Novak Djokovic, the top-ranked men’s tennis player in the world, from entering the nation ahead of the Australian Open tournament, after immigration authorities said he didn’t meet entry requirements. “Mr. Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia, and his visa has been subsequently canceled,” the Australian Border Force said in a statement. “Noncitizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa canceled will be detained and removed from Australia.” His arrival in the country on Wednesday was mired in confusion after an airport dispute about the validity of his visa and questions about the evidence supporting an exemption from being vaccinated. Australia allows travelers who can show proof either of vaccination or of a valid medical reason for not being vaccinated to enter the country without quarantining. Djokovic, an outspoken critic of vaccine mandates, has not said publicly whether he has been vaccinated against the coronavirus. But he announced on Tuesday that he had received a medical exemption from the Australian Open’s vaccine mandate to defend his title in Melbourne, where the year’s first major tennis tournament is played. Tournament officials confirmed that in a statement on Tuesday, saying his application had been reviewed by two independent panels, a procedure that strongly suggested that he was unvaccinated. An Australian newspaper, The Age, reported that a plane carrying Djokovic landed at Tullamarine Airport in Melbourne around 11:30 p.m. local time on Wednesday, and that Djokovic, who is Serbian, was still being questioned by officials from the Australian Border Force more than six hours later. Kyrie Irving, the star Nets guard, made his regular-season debut against the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night following the team’s surprise reversal of its policy to bar him from practices and road games until he received the coronavirus vaccine. Irving looked rusty early on against the Pacers, missing his first three shots. But in the second quarter in Indianapolis, he began to heat up and scored 8 straight points. Irving declined to be vaccinated for Covid-19 before the season, making him ineligible to play in New York City because of a local vaccine mandate at sports arenas that went into effect in September. The Nets, citing concerns about team chemistry, announced in October that Irving would not be permitted to play in road games either, even if laws in those cities would allow him to participate. The N.B.A. does not require players to be vaccinated. For the most part, the team has played well in Irving’s absence, and has led the Eastern Conference for much of the season. Entering Wednesday, the Nets were No. 2 in the East, behind Chicago, with a 23-12 record after losing four of their last six games. But last month, as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus began ravaging N.B.A. rosters, the Nets announced they would let Irving play in road games. Sean Marks, the team’s general manager, said at the time that the Nets were “faced with a roster that has been decimated over the course of the last several days.” Several of the Nets’ top players, including Kevin Durant and James Harden, have missed games because of the league’s virus-related health and safety protocols. Irving was immediately placed into the protocols as well. The N.B.A.’s rules say an unvaccinated player can be placed into the protocols because of a positive or inconclusive test, or a confirmed exposure to a person who had tested positive. Players can be cleared to play again through testing and isolation periods that vary according to the players’ symptoms but that can be as short as a few days. When Irving returned to action on Wednesday night, all of the Nets’ roster was available except guard Joe Harris, who is out with an ankle injury. The United States Postal Service says it wants an exemption to the federal vaccine-or-test mandate because it could hinder its ability to deliver the mail. “The Postal Service is seeking temporary relief because it wants to ensure that its ability to deliver mail and packages is not hindered amid the current disruptions in the nation’s supply chain,” Darlene Casey, a U.S.P.S. spokeswoman, said in a statement on Wednesday. In November, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued an emergency order requiring that organizations with more than 100 employees require their workers to either be vaccinated against Covid-19 or be tested weekly and subjected to stricter face-covering requirements. The U.S.P.S. formally requested a variance from that order in a letter to OSHA dated Tuesday. “We are now in the middle of our peak season (mid-October through January), which is our busiest and most challenging time of year,” Deputy Postmaster General Doug A. Tulino wrote in the letter, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times. “The American people are relying on us to timely deliver their mail and packages throughout the holiday season — which aren’t limited to holiday packages but include critical items like Treasury checks, Covid-19 tests and pharmaceuticals.” He added that the mandate was “likely to result in the loss of many employees” just when they are needed most. Such a loss “would have a potentially catastrophic impact on our ability to provide service to the American public when demand is at its highest,” Mr. Tulino wrote. The Postal Service requires all employees and contractors “who interact with the public” to wear face coverings “when there is a state, local or tribal directive in place that requires face coverings to be worn,” Mr. Tulino wrote. Face coverings are also required for employees and contractors who cannot maintain social distancing, he wrote.  Those policies apply regardless of a person’s vaccination status, he said. In the last 18 months, the Postal Service has received “only a handful of citations” related to pandemic restrictions, which, Mr. Tulino wrote, “illustrates that the Postal Service’s established Covid-19 mitigation measures have been extremely successful to date.”   Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York said she would ask the State Legislature to make the sale of drinks to go at bars and restaurants legal, cementing in law a popular emergency policy that helped the battered hospitality industry weather the first year and a half of the pandemic. In her annual state of the state address, Governor Hochul said that legalizing to-go drinks was “something our bars and restaurants have been asking for” because it was “a critical revenue stream during the lean times last year.” Her aides said she would send a bill to the Legislature during the current session. She added, “Cheers, New York.” The previous governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, had used his emergency powers during the first year of the pandemic to put in place a special “off-premises privileges” rule allowing to-go alcohol sales. The measure was intended to throw a lifeline to the struggling food and beverage industry. Customers quickly grew accustomed to the convenience of takeout drinks. But the rule died when the state of emergency ended last June and the Legislature did not pass a measure that would extend it. Several other states, including Iowa and Arizona, have legalized the sale of takeout alcohol during the pandemic. Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, welcomed the news that Ms. Hochul would push for legislative action on the issue this year. “The drinks to go policy provides critically important revenue streams to struggling restaurants and bars and is extraordinarily popular with the public, unsurprisingly,” he said in a statement. Mr. Rigie added, “We commend Governor Hochul for her leadership, and we look forward to toasting her administration and the State Legislature once this important policy is reinstated.” The announcement on Wednesday came as the highly contagious Omicron variant has driven cases to record highs in New York State. New daily cases were averaging more than 66,000 by Jan. 4, according to a New York Times database. The Italian government made Covid-19 vaccination mandatory for people 50 and older on Wednesday, as it sought to curb the explosive growth in new cases because of the Omicron variant. The government also approved rules that prevent the unvaccinated from entering businesses, including banks, post offices and some stores. Previously, workers older than 50 could show proof of a negative test to do their jobs. Now they will have to be vaccinated or show proof they have recovered from an infection. The measures go into effect on Feb. 15. “We want to curb the growth of infections and push the Italians who haven’t gotten vaccinated yet to do so,” Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, said in a statement on Wednesday. “We are targeting in particular age groups that are at higher risk of being hospitalized to reduce the pressure on hospitals and save lives.” Mr. Draghi added that the government’s goal was to keep hospitals working while, at the same time, keeping schools and businesses open. With new infections rising fast, scientists fear that hospitals may soon have to shut down regular activities to devote beds and personnel to Covid patients. Almost 7 percent of Italians over 50 are estimated to have not received any vaccination yet. Vaccination rates are high in Italy, the first country outside China to be severely hit by the pandemic. But there still are millions of unvaccinated people. The government also set aside 92.5 million euros, or about $104.6 million, for free rapid testing in schools to lessen the effect of the virus and avoid the huge use of remote learning, said the education minister, Patrizio Bianchi. A small, new real-world study suggests that two widely used at-home antigen tests, the Abbott BinaxNOW and Quidel QuickVue, may fail to detect some Omicron infections even when people are carrying high levels of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, focused on 30 people infected with the virus at five workplaces that experienced what were most likely outbreaks of the Omicron variant in December. The people received both saliva-based P.C.R. tests and rapid antigen tests using nasal swabs. It took three days, on average, for people to test positive on a rapid antigen test after their first positive P.C.R. result. In four cases, people transmitted the virus to others while the rapid test showed the negative result, according to the study, which was conducted by several members of the Covid-19 Sports and Society Working Group. It is not clear whether the infections were missed because the antigen tests are inherently less sensitive to Omicron or because saliva tests may be better at detecting the new variant. But the results are consistent with other preliminary evidence that the at-home tests that many Americans have come to rely on — at least as currently administered, with a nasal swab — may fail to detect some Omicron cases in the first days of infection. The researchers said they shared their results with federal officials — including at the White House, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — in real-time, as the outbreaks were occurring last month. The study comes a week after the Food and Drug Administration released its own update on the effectiveness of the rapid antigen tests. “Early data suggests that antigen tests do detect the Omicron variant but may have reduced sensitivity,” the agency said. President Biden’s coronavirus response coordinator said Wednesday that, beginning next week, Americans struggling to get tested for the coronavirus will be able to have the cost of rapid at-home tests reimbursed by their insurers, but offered no specific promises about when free tests would be available. The remarks by Jeff Zients, who leads the White House pandemic response, come two weeks after Mr. Biden said his administration would buy half a billion rapid tests to distribute free to the public, and that insurance companies would begin reimbursing people for tests they purchased on their own. Mr. Biden said at the time that the free tests would be available “in the coming weeks.” With the Omicron variant of the coronavirus fueling a sharp rise in cases across the country, demand for all kinds of tests is far outpacing supply. In some areas, people are waiting in long lines to take the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., tests that are administered at medical clinics. Rapid at-home tests are flying off pharmacy shelves. “We know this remains frustrating for people getting tested in many parts of the country,” Mr. Zients said on Wednesday. “So we are working to do all we can.” The administration’s new “test to stay” guidance for schools, in which students exposed to the virus can remain in the classroom if they test negative, is among the factors driving up demand for the rapid tests. Last week, when Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, omitted a testing requirement from new isolation guidelines, she was greeted with a chorus of criticism from public health experts who said a negative test should be required before an infected person ends a five-day isolation period. On Tuesday, the C.D.C. amended the latest guidance — not to say that testing was required, but to say that people who wanted to end their isolation periods after five days and had access to tests may choose to take them. If the test results are positive, they should stay home for another five days, the guidance says; if negative, and their symptoms are resolving, they may go out, but should continue to wear masks in public for another five days. Addressing reporters on Wednesday, Dr. Walensky said she omitted a testing requirement from the guidance because rapid tests are not authorized by the Food and Drug Administration to determine whether someone is infectious to others; they are authorized merely to detect infection, and are meant to be used serially, as is the case in schools. But after the guidance was released, she said, “it became very clear that people were interested in using the rapid tests,” and since that was the case, she at least wanted to “provide guidance on how they should be used.” The recommendation for the general public is different from the one for health care workers, who are required to test negative before going back to work. Dr. Walensky said the C.D.C. was always more conservative in its recommendations for health workers, because they care for vulnerable people, including those with weak immune systems. Matching testing supply with demand has been a challenge for both the Trump and Biden administrations. Early in the pandemic, there was a shortage of tests and the components that make up test kits. By late 2020, manufacturers had expanded production. But once vaccines arrived, the Biden administration put less emphasis on testing. Demand plunged, and manufacturers pulled back. Now the manufacturers are running at full speed again. Mr. Zients said manufacturers would begin delivering rapid tests kits to the federal government next week, and that the administration would set up a “free and easy system, including a website” where Americans could order them. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Wednesday that new federal testing sites would open this week in the District of Columbia and Philadelphia, followed soon after by Maine, Maryland, Nevada, Delaware, Texas and Washington state. She noted that mobile testing sites were already open in New York City and New Jersey. LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday scaled back restrictions on people traveling to England as the Omicron variant appears to be so widespread that measures tightened in November can no longer stem the spread. Starting Friday, vaccinated travelers will no longer need to take a test before their journey, Mr. Johnson said in a statement to Parliament on Wednesday. They will still need to take one within two days of arrival, he said, though a rapid antigen test is enough. As of Sunday, the government will not require a more expensive P.C.R. test. The changes were welcomed by the country’s hard-hit aviation industry. Mr. Johnson defended the stricter travel restrictions that were put in place in late November, when the Omicron variant was first identified, as necessary to slow its arrival. “But now,” he said, “Omicron is so prevalent, these measures are having limited impact on the growth in cases, while continuing to pose significant costs on our travel industry.” The decision announced Wednesday effectively takes Britain back to the same rules it operated in October. But unvaccinated passengers will still be required to take a pre-departure test and to self-isolate on arrival for 10 days, during which time they must take two P.C.R. tests. There were 194,747 daily cases recorded in the United Kingdom, according to data released on Wednesday, near the record of 218,724 cases announced on Tuesday. Mr. Johnson’s announcement covered England only, but Wales said it would take a similar step, and Scotland and Northern Ireland were expected to follow suit. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, an industry body, said the relaxed rules were a “hugely welcome move at a critical time in the booking season for passengers.” The change would, he said in a statement, “provide a massive boost to those wanting to travel abroad or come to the U.K. this year.” He added, “People will now be able to book knowing that, for the fully vaccinated, all emergency testing restrictions have been removed.” PARIS — Faced with a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant, President Emmanuel Macron of France said Wednesday that he wanted to “piss off” millions of his citizens who refuse to get vaccinated by squeezing them out of the country’s public spaces. By shocking the nation with a vulgarity three months before presidential elections, Mr. Macron was relaying not only a public health message, but also a political one. He appeared to be calculating that tapping into the growing public anger against the unvaccinated held more potential electoral rewards than the risk of angering an anti-vaccination minority whose support he has little hope of ever getting. Using his harshest language yet to urge the recalcitrant to get their shots, Mr. Macron said he would not “throw them in prison” or “vaccinate them by force.” But he made it clear he meant to make their lives harder. In doing so, Mr. Macron, an inveterate political gambler who became the nation’s youngest leader ever five years ago, effectively kicked off his campaign for re-election Wednesday, drawing clear lines between his supporters and opponents. He also moved the focus of debate away from themes like immigration and Islam that have dominated the political race so far and that are advantageous to his strongest rivals, on the right and far right. Mr. Macron was clearly seeking to tap into a rich political vein that his counterparts have been more cautious to exploit: anger among the majority of vaccinated people at a minority who refuse to get vaccinated and disproportionately occupy hospital beds. More than 77 percent of French people, and 92 percent of those 12 and older, have received at least two doses, according to the government. “The unvaccinated, I really want to piss them off,” Mr. Macron said, using a French word that is more vulgar, explaining that a new, reinforced vaccine pass would make it impossible for the unvaccinated to go to restaurants and cafes, or the theater and cinemas. Their recalcitrance, as well as the surge in cases in France, is threatening to undermine his success so far in tackling the pandemic. RIO DE JANEIRO — While Rio de Janeiro’s renowned Carnival parade will go on, the city will cancel its street parties, which ordinarily draw millions of revelers, the mayor says, citing the Omicron variant. The freewheeling public celebrations “won’t be possible,” Mayor Eduardo Paes Casaid at a news conference on Tuesday. “It’s been decided: there won’t be street carnival in the tradition of the past.” Mr. Paes said the official parade, in which samba groups put on elaborately choreographed shows flanked by bleachers that seat 56,000 people, would be held, with some health precautions. Last year, Carnival was canceled in its entirely because of the pandemic, but for many Brazilians, the real show is the street parties, and Cariocas, as Rio residents are known, were devastated to learn that they would not take place. “I was very excited, very hopeful, for the 2022 Carnival, even more so after a year without Carnival,” said João Ramos, 26. Mr. Ramos, a designer, said that as soon as he read the news, he shared it with friends, who had already been discussing what costumes to wear. “It poured cold water on us, everyone was so sad,” he said. Still, Mr. Ramos said, the decision is understandable. Already the effect of year-end celebrations can be seen: The number of cases is ticking up again, after plunging for months. As Carnival approached, many Brazilians had begun cautiously rehearsing again, planning for that outburst of samba-fueled joy when they and millions of visitors take over public spaces and shake off the previous year’s sorrows. After two years of a pandemic, they said, it was sorely needed. “With most Brazilians fully immunized, we thought it was happening,” said Tatiana Paz, the organizer of one street performance group. “But then the situation worsened again, and there is nothing we can do about it.” Other major cities such as Olinda, São Luís, and Florianópolis have also canceled their carnival events in the past 24 hours. Rio canceled both the parade and the street parties in 2021, when Brazil’s death toll surged as its vaccination campaign was off to a slow start. But toward the end of the year, as shots became more widely available, Brazilians embraced them: About 68 percent of the country’s population is fully vaccinated, and the country’s caseload and death toll plunged. The period of relative calm that followed allowed the population to begin socializing again. Streets, beaches, and bars became packed as summer set in. On Copacabana beach, the sky was filled with fireworks as onlookers welcomed the New Year.  However, cases started rising again as Omicron spread around the world. Rio’s annual Carnival, considered to be one of the largest in the world, takes place in the weeks leading up to Ash Wednesday, the Western Christian holy day that marks the start of Lent. Ash Wednesday falls on March 2 this year. The city’s tradition, with its lively music and elaborate costumes, has endured and often thrived even in difficult times. Brazilians have danced through wars, hyperinflation, repressive military rule, runaway street violence and the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic. Official calls to postpone Carnival in Brazil in 1892 (for sanitation reasons) and 1912 (to mourn the death of a national hero) were largely ignored. In another city famous for Carnival, New Orleans, this year’s Mardi Gras parades appear to be moving forward. The event was canceled in 2021. For the second year in a row, the Grammy Awards have been pushed back by the coronavirus pandemic. The 64th annual ceremony, which had been set for Jan. 31 in Los Angeles, has been rescheduled, according to a joint statement on Wednesday from the Recording Academy and CBS, as the Omicron variant has led to a surge in cases nationwide. The new date will be announced soon, the statement said, noting, “The health and safety of those in our music community, the live audience, and the hundreds of people who work tirelessly to produce our show remains our top priority.” Last year’s show was postponed by six weeks as cases spiked, and before vaccinations were widely available. Last week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, predicted that the latest wave of the pandemic may reach its peak in the United States by the end of January. This year the composer and bandleader Jon Batiste has 11 Grammy nominations, more than any other artist, and will compete for both album and record of the year. Other top nominees include Olivia Rodrigo, Justin Bieber, Billie Eilish and Doja Cat. No performers have been announced yet. Gov. Kathy M. Hochul of New York said Wednesday that she would propose spending $10 billion to help rebuild a health care work force that has been exhausted and depleted by the nearly two-year-old pandemic. “We simply do not have enough health care workers in our hospitals, or in our long-term care facilities, in our ambulances, or in the homes of our loved ones,” the governor said in her first State of the State speech in Albany, labeling the moment a crisis.  The state health work force is about 6 percent smaller than it was before the pandemic. Even before the coronavirus strained the system, officials had projected the work force would need to grow by 11 percent by the end of 2022 to meet demand, the governor’s office reported. “We must stop the current hemorrhaging of health care workers,” Ms. Hochul said in her speech. “And we’re going to do it. Not just by saying we owe them a debt of gratitude, but actually paying them the debt we owe.” She proposed spending more than $4 billion to support wages and bonuses to increase the number of health care workers in the state by 20 percent over the next five years. That would include up to $3,000 in bonuses for all full-time health care workers who remain in their positions for a year, and $2 billion in spending on health care capital infrastructure and improved lab capacity. The governor also wants to offer free tuition to students who are preparing to work in high-demand health occupations and to provide stipends to make up for lost income while they are in school. Doctors could receive loan forgiveness up to $120,000 if they work in underserved areas for three years. She also wants to start a “Nurses Across N.Y.” Program to place nurses in underserved areas. Hospitals across the state are reporting that staffing is the biggest challenge of this stage of the pandemic, as new cases soared this week to levels not seen since the first wave in May 2020. The result has been packed emergency rooms and waits for beds at some institutions, though fewer patients are requiring intensive care because of vaccinations and what scientists say is the milder nature of the Omicron variant. As the governor spoke in Albany, the new mayor of New York, Eric Adams, laid out a plan to provide $111 million in new funding for the city’s public hospitals to help them cope with the surge in patients caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant. He also announced a $27 million loan program for the city’s so-called safety-net hospitals, which are outside the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation network. A small, new real-world study suggests that two widely used at-home antigen tests, the Abbott BinaxNow and Quidel QuickVue, may fail to detect Omicron infections when people are carrying high levels of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, focused on 30 people, who were most likely infected with Omicron, who tested positive for the virus at workplace surveillance programs. They took both saliva-based P.C.R. tests and rapid antigen tests using nasal swabs. It took three days, on average, for people to test positive on a rapid antigen test after their first positive P.C.R. result. In four cases, people transmitted the virus to others while the rapid test showed the negative result, the study noted. It is not clear whether the infections were missed because the antigen tests are inherently less sensitive for Omicron or because saliva samples may be a better way to detect the new variant. But the results suggest that the at-home tests that many Americans have come to rely on — at least as currently administered, with a nasal swab — may be failing to detect Omicron in the first days of infection. Anne Wyllie, a microbiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and a co-author of the study, urged people to interpret negative test results with caution. “People should not ignore high risk exposures,” she said. “They should not ignore symptoms.” Rapid antigen tests, which are designed to detect proteins on the surface of the coronavirus, have always been less sensitive than P.C.R. tests, which amplify the virus’s genetic material and can detect even very small traces of the virus. But in the new study, the rapid antigen tests failed to detect the virus even in people who had high viral loads, and who were thus likely to be infectious. The tests were done over a series of up to 10 days. The discordant results overwhelmingly came during the first three days of infection. The study, by researchers at the University of Washington, the Yale School of Public Health and others, concluded: “In real-world antigen testing, the limit of detection was substantially lower than manufacturers have reported to the F.D.A. based on laboratory validation.” In 29 of 30 people, samples of the virus produced a telltale genetic pattern on P.C.R. tests, suggesting that they were likely infected with Omicron. Although the study is small and has not yet been reviewed by experts, it fits with emerging research suggesting that some rapid antigen tests may be less sensitive to Omicron than to other variants. It is also consistent with a recent report from South Africa, which suggests that saliva samples might be a better way to detect Omicron than nasal swabs. The study comes a week after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released an update that made headlines by stating: “Early data suggests that antigen tests do detect the omicron variant but may have reduced sensitivity.” An Abbott spokesman, John Koval, said on Wednesday that the finding that a P.C.R. test is more sensitive is “not new.”  “Due to immediate turnaround time, frequent rapid antigen testing does slow transmission — and with a highly infectious variant frequent testing is needed, which is not realistic with P.C.R.,” he wrote in an email. Quidel’s president, Douglas Bryant, said in a statement that the company performed recent testing using samples from South Africa and confirmed that its rapid tests are detecting the Omicron variant. “The QuickVue antigen tests are able to detect the live Omicron variant with similar performance as with other variants,” he said. Hong Kong announced a series of strict pandemic control measures on Wednesday, including suspending flights from the United States and seven other countries, as it scrambled to contain an incipient coronavirus outbreak. The new measures came as the authorities held thousands of passengers of a cruise ship under mandatory quarantine to trace a Covid case. The flight bans will deepen the city’s isolation from the outside world and mark a return to the tough restrictions the city imposed in the early days of the pandemic. Hong Kong has largely brought the coronavirus under control, but the arrival of the highly transmissible Omicron variant threatens to set off the city’s fifth wave of the pandemic. “Given the very dire situation of the pandemic, we have to grasp this critical moment,” Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said at a news conference. Mrs. Lam had said on Tuesday that no new social distancing measures were expected. But the spread of Omicron, including the infection of a person with no clear connections to the city’s first detected Omicron cluster, evidently forced a change. “We have to contain the pandemic to make sure there will not be a major outbreak in the community again,” she said. “We are racing with Omicron.” The restrictions will make it even harder to enter Hong Kong, which already imposes some of the world’s longest quarantines — up to three weeks. Under the new rules, no flights will be allowed from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines or United States for two weeks, starting on Saturday. People who have recently been in those countries will also be barred from entering Hong Kong by other routes. Large public events will be canceled, and several types of public venues — including bars, gyms and karaoke parlors — will be closed. Visitors will be barred from hospitals and nursing homes for two weeks. Dining in restaurants after 6 p.m. will be banned. But the government decided not to stop in-person instruction in schools, or to require government officials to work from home. Hong Kong has reported a growing number of imported cases involving the Omicron variant, with 133 as of Tuesday.  “If this continues, there will be tremendous strain on our quarantine and health care facilities,” said Dr. Ronald Lam, Hong Kong’s director of health. An Omicron outbreak in the city has been traced to a Cathay Pacific flight attendant who ignored quarantine requirements after returning to the city from the United States. He dined at the Moon Palace restaurant in the upscale Fashion Walk shopping mall on Dec. 27, infecting his father and at least one other person, who then infected others. The restrictions came as Hong Kong health authorities on Wednesday ordered a Royal Caribbean cruise ship to return to port early as officials searched for the contacts of a Covid-19 patient. Nine people who boarded the ship, the Spectrum of the Seas, on Jan. 2 had come into contact with the patient, who did not board the ship, the government said in a statement. The nine were told to quarantine as soon as they were identified as contacts, though they preliminarily tested negative. The vessel, which was carrying about 2,500 guests and 1,200 staff members, was scheduled to return on Thursday but was back in port as ordered on Wednesday morning, a Royal Caribbean representative said. More than 3,000 passengers of the ship were subjected to mandatory quarantine, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said at a news conference on Wednesday. All crew members and guests 12 and older had to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and provide negative test results before boarding, the cruise line said in a statement. The passengers who sailed on the ship will receive a 25 percent refund on their cruise fare, it added. The cruise line also said that it had canceled another ship scheduled to depart on Thursday and that all guests who had booked it would receive a full refund. All nine of the justices on the Supreme Court have received booster shots of the coronavirus vaccine, a spokeswoman said. The justices have all been fully vaccinated since last March. The court is preparing to hear arguments on Friday in two major challenges to the Biden administration’s efforts to address the coronavirus in the workplace. As they have since the beginning of the current term in October, the justices will hear arguments on Friday in person in the Supreme Court’s courtroom. The courthouse remains closed to the public, and lawyers and credentialed journalists are required to wear N95 masks and to have recently received a negative test for the virus. The court does not require proof of vaccination. Friday’s arguments concern measures requiring vaccination or frequent testing of workers at large employers and vaccination of health care workers at facilities that receive federal money. The court will provide a live audio feed of the arguments on its website. The Sundance Film Festival announced Wednesday that it will cancel all in-person events set for Jan. 20-30. The news comes as virus cases are spiking because of the Omicron variant. The festival will now be virtual for a second year in a row. Sundance, in a news release, said it was “a difficult decision” to cancel its first hybrid festival, which would have allowed patrons to watch films either in-person in Park City, Utah, or online via a portal. The release noted that with case numbers expected to peak in Park City and the surrounding Summit County during the week of the festival, “we cannot knowingly put our staff and community at risk. The undue stress to Summit County’s health services and our more than 1,500 staff and volunteers would be irresponsible in this climate.” The news follows the announcement earlier today that the Recording Academy would postpone the Grammys, set to take place Jan. 31 in Los Angeles. In recent weeks, the Palm Springs International Film Festival canceled its event, and both the American Film Institute awards luncheon and the Critics Choice Awards, set for January, were postponed. Last year was the first time Sundance held a completely virtual event. The multiday affair was deemed a success considering the circumstances and generated one of the highest sales in the festival’s history when Apple paid $25 million for the film “CODA,” which is now looking for recognition in the awards race. The World Health Organization says that it is monitoring a coronavirus variant detected in a small number of patients in France, but that, for now, there is little reason to worry about its spread. The B.1.640.2 variant was first identified in October and uploaded to Gisaid, a database for disease variants, on Nov. 4. Only about 20 samples have been sequenced so far, experts said this week, and only one since early December. Abdi Mahmud, a Covid incident manager with the W.H.O., told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday that the variant had been on the agency’s radar since November, but added that it did not appear to have spread widely over the past two months. “That virus has had a lot of chances to pick up,” he said. By contrast, the Omicron variant, which was first uploaded to Gisaid on Nov. 23, has more than 120,000 sequences in the database. (The vast majority of Omicron cases have not been sequenced.) It has been detected in at least 128 countries, according to the W.H.O., and is fueling record-high case numbers in many parts of the world. Concerns over the variant in France arose after researchers found that it contained 46 mutations that differed from the original version of the coronavirus. Omicron also has a high number of mutations, which researchers believe made it far more transmissible. According to a research paper that was published on a preprint server in late December, but that has not been peer-reviewed, the B.1.640.2 variant was first detected in southeastern France in a vaccinated person who had recently traveled from Cameroon. Researchers found a total of 12 cases in the area and named the variant “I.H.U.,” after the research institute in Marseille that helped identify it. “It is too early to speculate on virological, epidemiological or clinical features of this I.H.U. variant based on these 12 cases,” researchers wrote. Numerous coronavirus variants have emerged over the past two years, and the reasons that some spread widely while others do not are complex. For now, several independent researchers say there is little reason to be concerned about the I.H.U. variant. Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College in London, tweeted this week that, so far, “this virus has had a decent chance to cause trouble but never really materialised.” After going virtual last year, CES, a mega-conference in Las Vegas that’s the traditional launchpad for many of the tech industry’s latest gadgets, is trying to make a comeback. The trade show kicks off on Wednesday, with an estimated 2,200 exhibitors set to show up in person. But with the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus surging, scores of major tech companies are still presenting mostly virtually. It’s a sign that decisions to hold big in-person events at this phase of the pandemic remain far from clear-cut, the DealBook newsletter reports. Yet the organizers of CES — like those of the Winter Olympics and the Australian Open, which are set to begin soon — have decided it’s time to gather in person again. Canceling the show would “hurt thousands of smaller companies, entrepreneurs and innovators” who depend on the show to introduce their products, Gary Shapiro, the chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, the trade group that organizes CES, wrote in an opinion column in The Las Vegas Review-Journal. (The conference is also important for Las Vegas, which reaped an estimated $291 million from spending tied to it in 2020.) Mr. Shapiro noted that the conference had embraced pandemic protections like requiring attendees to be fully vaccinated and masked while on the show floor, and that testing was readily available. But many large companies have chosen to attend remotely, including Amazon, AMD, AT&T, General Motors, Google, Intel, Lenovo, Meta, Nvidia, Pinterest, T-Mobile and Twitter. That will leave “big gaps on the show floor,” Mr. Shapiro said. And CES will end a day early, in what the organizers said was a concession to safety. Other big events are delaying their return to in-person gatherings. The World Economic Forum postponed its annual confab in Davos, Switzerland, which was set to take place this month. So is it safe to hold live in-person events again? Omicron cases appear to be less severe than cases from previous variants, and vaccines and new treatments are becoming available. More governments are also edging toward managing, not containing, the coronavirus, and are increasingly reluctant to reimpose restrictions. That could mean that a return to regular mass gatherings in some places may not be far-off. In hospitals around the country, doctors are taking notice: This wave of Covid seems different from the last one. Once again, as they face the highly contagious Omicron variant, medical personnel are exhausted and are contracting the virus themselves. And the numbers of patients entering hospitals with the variant are surging to staggering levels, filling up badly needed beds, delaying nonemergency procedures and increasing the risk that vulnerable uninfected patients will catch the virus. But in Omicron hot spots from New York to Florida to Texas, a smaller proportion of those patients are landing in intensive care units or requiring mechanical ventilation, doctors said. And many — roughly 50 to 65 percent of admissions in some New York hospitals — show up at the hospital for other ailments and then test positive for the virus. “We are seeing an increase in the number of hospitalizations,” said Dr. Rahul Sharma, emergency physician in chief for NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital. But the severity of the disease looks different from previous waves, he said. “We’re not sending as many patients to the I.C.U., we’re not intubating as many patients, and actually, most of our patients that are coming to the emergency department that do test positive are actually being discharged.” Though it’s still early for firm predictions, the shift in hospital patterns fits with emerging data that Omicron may be a variant with inherently milder effects than those that have come before, less prone to infecting the lungs, where it can cause serious disease. But the lower proportion of severe cases is also happening because, compared with previous variants, Omicron is infecting more people who have some prior immunity, whether through prior infection or vaccination. The vast majority of Omicron patients in I.C.U.s are unvaccinated or have severely compromised immune systems, doctors said. Hospitals, facing staff shortages, are under enormous strain. In New York City, hospitalizations have exceeded the peak of last winter’s surge. And Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, noting that the state had more hospitalized Covid-19 patients at that time than at any previous point during the pandemic. “We’re in truly crushed mode,” said Dr. Gabe Kelen, director of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s emergency department. The number of I.C.U. patients is a lagging indicator, likely to rise in the coming weeks, experts said. What’s more, some states are still struggling under the crush of hospitalizations from Delta, a previous version of the virus that may be more virulent. (Hospitals are frequently in the dark about which variant newly admitted patients are infected with.) NEW DELHI — When the Omicron coronavirus variant spread through India late in December, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged the nation to be vigilant and follow medical guidelines. Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of the capital region of Delhi, swiftly introduced night curfews, shut down movie theaters, and slashed restaurants and public transport to half capacity. Then, both men hit the campaign trail, often appearing without masks in packed rallies of thousands. “When it is our bread and butter at stake, they force restrictions and lockdowns,” said Ajay Tiwari, a 41-year-old taxi driver in New Delhi. “There are much bigger crowds at political rallies, but they don’t impose any lockdown in those areas. It really pains us deep in the heart.” As Omicron fuels a rapid spread of new infections through India’s major urban hubs, the country’s pandemic fatigue has been intensified by a sense of déjà vu and the frustration of mixed signals. It has been just a few months since the deadly Delta variant ravaged the country, when government leaders vastly underestimated its threat and publicly flouted their own advice. The memories of overwhelmed hospitals and funeral pyres working around the clock are still all too fresh here. The metropolis of Mumbai on Wednesday reported more than 15,000 new infections in 24 hours — the highest daily caseload since the pandemic began, beating the city’s previous record of about 11,000 cases during the second wave in the spring. In New Delhi, the number of daily infections increased by nearly 100 percent overnight. The sheer size of India’s population, at 1.4 billion, has always kept experts wary about the prospects of a new coronavirus variant. In few places around world was the toll of Delta as stark as in India. The country’s official figures show about half a million pandemic deaths — a number that experts say vastly undercounts the real toll. WASHINGTON — President Biden came into office vowing to restore public trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after the Trump White House had tied the agency’s hands and manipulated its scientific judgments on the pandemic for political ends. Yet in his first year, Mr. Biden has presided over a series of messaging failures that have followed a familiar pattern, with the agency’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, and her team making what experts say are largely sound decisions, but fumbling in communicating them to America. Dr. Walensky, a highly regarded infectious disease expert from Boston with no prior government experience, insisted in February that schools must keep students six feet apart; in March, she said three feet was enough. She said in February that teachers did not need to be vaccinated to reopen schools; the White House said the next day that she was speaking “in her personal capacity.” In May, she said that vaccinated people generally did not need to wear masks in public, a sudden change that flummoxed state health officials. Two months later, she reversed that guidance after it was shown that vaccinated people could still transmit the coronavirus. More recently, with the Omicron variant driving a near vertical rise in cases, Dr. Walensky alerted the White House that she planned to recommend that people infected with the virus isolate for five days instead of 10. To avoid another messaging fiasco, she briefed other top Biden health officials on her proposal so they would all be on the same page, according to two people familiar with her actions. But both Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, and Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, the surgeon general, took issue on national television with the agency’s policy of not requiring a negative Covid test before ending the shorter isolation. Dr. Tom Frieden, the agency’s director under President Barack Obama, said he did not believe the latest recommendations on isolation were significantly wrong, but “the way they were released was very problematic.” The crux of the problem, several administration officials said, is a failure by the C.D.C. and the Biden administration’s messaging experts to work in concert. Dr. Walensky’s critics say she is not collaborative enough, too often springing decisions on other federal officials who then struggle to defend them in public. Her defenders say that she strives to coordinate, but that it is not her job to ensure consensus across the entire administration. Some suggest the White House has gone too far in its hands-off, let-the-scientists-rule approach, leaving a vacuum of leadership and forcing ad hoc coordination between the various public health agencies. On the day President Biden was inaugurated, the advisory board of health experts who counseled him during his transition officially ceased to exist. But its members have quietly continued to meet regularly over Zoom, their conversations often turning to frustration with Mr. Biden’s coronavirus response. Now, six of these former advisers have gone public with an extraordinary, albeit polite, critique — and a plea to be heard. In three opinion articles published on Thursday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, they called for Mr. Biden to adopt an entirely new domestic pandemic strategy geared to the “new normal” of living with the virus indefinitely, not to wiping it out. The authors are all big names in American medicine. Several, including Dr. Luciana Borio, a former acting chief scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, and Dr. David Michaels, a former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration now with George Washington University’s School of Public Health, have held high-ranking government positions. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist, medical ethicist and University of Pennsylvania professor who advised former President Barack Obama, organized the effort. Like any White House, Mr. Biden’s prizes loyalty and prefers to keep its differences in house; in that regard, the articles are an unusual step. The authors say they wrote them partly because they have not made headway talking directly to White House officials. “From a macroperspective, it feels like we are always fighting yesterday’s crisis and not necessarily thinking what needs to be done today to prepare us for what comes next,” Dr. Borio said. The authors shared the articles with White House officials before they were published, but it was unclear whether the administration would adopt any of their suggestions. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, Mr. Biden’s top medical adviser for the pandemic, declined to comment on the articles. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters she had not read the articles, and dismissed a question about whether the president “is coming around to accepting” that Covid-19 is here to stay, even though several recent media accounts suggested that the administration was beginning to operate under that assumption. Mr. Biden’s recent emphasis on keeping schools open and businesses running even when cases are soaring also suggests a recalibration, as does a recent decision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend that people with Covid isolate for five days instead of 10."
21,The New York Times,nytimes,"The United States Postal Service says it wants an exemption to the federal vaccine-or-test mandate because it could hinder its ability to deliver mail. The rule could have a “catastrophic” effect on delivery, the deputy postmaster general said.",https://nyti.ms/3eTldbJ?fbclid=IwAR09epo_S57mTDpJXRP1T1lu-cpR7r-60Ll8aMgasmeAZl1OZeIXGbJj5MI,23h,"Protests in Kazakhstan incited by anger over surging fuel prices have intensified into something more combustible and bloody: clashes over the future direction of the country that have prompted a Russia-led military intervention and the killing of dozens of antigovernment demonstrators. Hundreds more have been injured. The government said on Friday that order had been “mainly restored” after thousands of angry protesters took to the streets of Kazakhstan, creating the biggest crisis to shake the autocratic Central Asian country since it gained independence in 1991. City Hall in Almaty, the country’s largest city, was set ablaze. An angry mob took over the airport. Protesters set fire to police vehicles and to the regional branch of the ruling Nur Otan party. The police, in turn, accused demonstrators of being responsible for the deaths of 13 officers and for leaving 353 injured. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has authorized the nation’s security forces to “fire without warning.” The harsh response is a reflection of the stark challenges he faces less than three years into his rule, and seems to portend a protracted crackdown on all forms of dissent, including antigovernment activists, human rights advocates and independent journalists. The protests are destabilizing an already volatile region where Russia and the United States compete for influence. They also symbolized a widespread discontent with Kazakhstan’s suffocating authoritarian government and with endemic corruption that has resulted in wealth being concentrated within a small political and economic elite. Anger boiled over when the government lifted price caps for liquefied petroleum gas — frequently referred to by its initials, L.P.G. — a low-carbon fuel that many Kazakhs use to power their cars. But the protests have more deep-seated roots, including anger at social and economic disparities, aggravated by a raging pandemic, as well the lack of real democracy. The average salary in Kazakhstan is the equivalent of $570 a month, according to the government’s statistics, but many people earn far less. As the protests have intensified, the demands of the demonstrators have expanded in scope from lower fuel prices to a broader political liberalization. Among the changes they seek is an election system for regional leaders, who are currently appointed by the president. In short, protesters are demanding the ouster of the political forces that have ruled the country without any substantial opposition since 1991. Sandwiched between Russia and China, Kazakhstan is the world’s largest landlocked country, bigger than the whole of Western Europe, though with a population of only 19 million. The latest demonstrations matter because the country has been regarded until now as a pillar of political and economic stability in an unstable region, even as that stability has come at the price of a repressive government that stifles dissent. The protests are also significant as Kazakhstan has been aligned with Russia, whose president, Vladimir V. Putin, views the country — a body double of sorts for Russia in terms of its economic and political systems — as part of Russia’s sphere of influence. The intervention by the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a Russian version of NATO, is the first time that its protection clause has been invoked, a move that could potentially have sweeping consequences for geopolitics in the region. The turmoil in Kazakhstan has once again exposed the vulnerability of the strongman leaders the Kremlin has trusted to keep order. It has also presented Russia with yet another opportunity to reassert its influence in its former Soviet domain. For the Kremlin, the events represent another possible challenge to autocratic power in a neighboring country. This is the third uprising against an authoritarian, Kremlin-aligned nation, following pro-democracy protests in Ukraine in 2014 and in Belarus in 2020. The chaos threatens to undermine Moscow’s sway in the region at a time when Russia is trying to assert its economic and geopolitical power in countries like Ukraine and Belarus. The countries of the former Soviet Union are also watching the protests closely, and the events in Kazakhstan could help energize opposition forces elsewhere. Kazakhstan also matters to the United States, as it has become a significant country for American energy concerns, with Exxon Mobil and Chevron having invested tens of billions of dollars in western Kazakhstan, the region where the unrest began this month. Although it has close ties with Moscow, consecutive Kazakh governments have also maintained close links to the United States, with oil investment seen as a counterweight to Russian influence. The United States government has long been less critical of post-Soviet authoritarianism in Kazakhstan than in Russia and Belarus. Mr. Tokayev, the Kazakh president, has called the protesters “a band of terrorists,” declared Kazakhstan under attack, authorized the security forces to “fire without warning” and asked the Russia-led military alliance to intervene. The government has also tried to quell the demonstrations by instituting a state of emergency and blocking social networking sites and chat apps, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram and, for the first time, the Chinese app WeChat. Public protests without permits were already illegal. It also initially conceded to a few of the demonstrators’ demands, dismissing the cabinet and announcing the possible dissolution of Parliament, which would result in new elections. But so far, those moves have largely failed to tame the discontent, setting the stage for Friday’s announcement calling for a harsher response. Less than three years ago, Kazakhstan’s aging president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, now 81, resigned. A former steelworker and Communist Party leader, he rose to power in Kazakhstan in 1989, when it was still part of the Soviet Union. During his rule, he attracted enormous investments from foreign energy companies to develop the nation’s oil reserves, which, at an estimated 30 billion barrels, are among the largest of all the former Soviet republics. The last surviving president in Central Asia to have steered his country to independence after the Soviet Union collapsed, Mr. Nazarbayev handed power in 2019 to Mr. Tokayev, then the speaker of the Upper House of Parliament and a former prime minister and foreign minister. Mr. Tokayev is widely perceived as the handpicked successor of Mr. Nazarbayev, who until recently was thought to wield considerable power, holding the title “leader of the nation” and serving as chairman of the country’s security council. But the revolt could be a decisive break with his rule. On Wednesday, Mr. Tokayev dismissed Mr. Nazarbayev from his post as chairman of the council. The new president, until now a loyalist, has been trying to carve out a stronger role for himself. That, in turn, has disoriented Kazakhstan’s bureaucracy and elites, and has contributed to the government’s slow reaction to the protesters’ demands, analysts say. During his three-decade rule, Mr. Nazarbayev won repeated elections with nearly 100 percent of the vote each time, often jailing political opponents or journalists who criticized him. Kazakhstan elected Mr. Tokayev in June 2019, but with lopsided election results in a tightly controlled vote marred by hundreds of detentions of demonstrators. The election was denounced as unfair by observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The result and the heavy-handed police action against peaceful protesters at the time suggested that while the country’s veteran leader had relinquished the presidency, the system he established during his long rule remained firmly in place. Until recently, Mr. Tokayev had sought to promote a somewhat softer image than his predecessor and mentor. But his latest language and actions suggest a strongman desperate to cling to power in a country that has descended into chaos."

Este año, los políticos de izquierda son los favoritos para ganar las elecciones presidenciales en Colombia y Brasil, sustituyendo a los presidentes en funciones de derecha, lo que pondría a la izquierda y a la centroizquierda en el poder en las seis economías más grandes de una región que se extiende desde Tijuana hasta Tierra del Fuego. El sufrimiento económico, el aumento de la desigualdad, el ferviente descontento con los gobernantes y la mala gestión de la pandemia de COVID-19 han impulsado un movimiento pendular que se distancia de los líderes de centroderecha y de derecha que dominaban hace unos años. La izquierda ha prometido una distribución más equitativa de la riqueza, mejores servicios públicos y redes de seguridad social ampliadas. Pero los nuevos líderes de la región se enfrentan a graves limitaciones económicas y a una oposición legislativa que podría restringir sus ambiciones, así como a unos votantes intranquilos que se han mostrado dispuestos a castigar a quien no cumpla lo prometido. Los avances de la izquierda podrían impulsar a China y socavar a Estados Unidos mientras compiten por la influencia regional, dicen los analistas, al presentarse una nueva cosecha de líderes latinoamericanos desesperados por lograr el desarrollo económico y con más apertura hacia la estrategia global de Pekín de ofrecer préstamos e inversiones en infraestructuras. El cambio también podría dificultar que Estados Unidos siga aislando a los regímenes autoritarios de izquierda en Venezuela, Nicaragua y Cuba. Con el aumento de la inflación y el estancamiento de las economías, los nuevos líderes de América Latina tendrán dificultades para lograr un cambio real en los problemas profundos, dijo Pedro Mendes Loureiro, profesor de estudios latinoamericanos en la Universidad de Cambridge. Hasta cierto punto, dijo, los votantes están “eligiendo a la izquierda simplemente porque en este momento es la oposición”. Los niveles de pobreza se encuentran en el nivel más alto de los últimos 20 años en una región en la que un efímero auge de las materias primas permitió a millones de personas ascender a la clase media tras el cambio de siglo. Varios países se enfrentan ahora a un desempleo de dos dígitos, y más del 50 por ciento de los trabajadores de la región están empleados en el sector informal. Los escándalos de corrupción, el deterioro de la infraestructura y la ausencia crónica de fondos en los sistemas de salud y educación han erosionado la confianza en el gobierno y las instituciones públicas. A diferencia de lo que ocurrió a principios de la década de 2000, cuando los izquierdistas ganaron presidencias decisivas en América Latina, los nuevos gobernantes tienen que hacer frente a la deuda, a presupuestos magros, a escaso acceso al crédito y, en muchos casos, a una oposición vociferante. Eric Hershberg, director del Centro de Estudios Latinoamericanos y Latinos de la American University, dijo que la racha ganadora de la izquierda nace de un sentimiento generalizado de indignación. “En realidad se trata de los sectores de la clase media baja y de la clase trabajadora que dicen: ‘treinta años de democracia y todavía tenemos que ir en un autobús decrépito durante dos horas para llegar a un centro de salud malo’”, dijo Hershberg. Citó la frustración, la ira y “una sensación generalizada de que las élites se han enriquecido, han sido corruptas, no han actuado en favor del interés público”. La COVID-19 asoló América Latina y devastó economías que ya eran precarias, pero la inclinación política de la región comenzó antes de la pandemia. El primer hito fue la elección en México de Andrés Manuel López Obrador, que ganó la presidencia con un resultado arrollador en julio de 2018. Durante su discurso de la noche electoral, declaró: “El Estado dejará de ser un comité al servicio de una minoría y representará a todos los mexicanos, a ricos y pobres”. Al año siguiente, los votantes de Panamá eligieron un gobierno de centroizquierda, y el movimiento peronista de izquierda de Argentina tuvo un sorprendente regreso a pesar del legado de corrupción y mala gestión económica de sus líderes. Con la promesa de “construir la Argentina que nos merecemos”, Alberto Fernández, profesor universitario, celebró su triunfo frente a un presidente conservador que buscaba la reelección. En 2020, Luis Arce se impuso a sus rivales conservadores para convertirse en presidente de Bolivia. Se comprometió a ampliar el legado del exlíder Evo Morales, un socialista cuya destitución el año anterior dejó brevemente a la nación en manos de una presidenta de derecha. En abril del año pasado, Pedro Castillo, un maestro de escuela de provincia, sorprendió a la clase política peruana al derrotar por un estrecho margen a la candidata derechista a la presidencia, Keiko Fujimori. Castillo, un recién llegado a la política, arremetió contra las élites y presentó la historia de su vida —un educador que trabajó en una escuela rural sin agua corriente ni sistema de alcantarillado— como una encarnación de los defectos de la clase gobernante. En Honduras, Xiomara Castro, una candidata de plataforma socialista que propuso el establecimiento de un sistema de renta básica universal para las familias pobres, venció con facilidad en noviembre a un rival conservador para convertirse en presidenta electa. La victoria más reciente de la izquierda se produjo el mes pasado en Chile, donde Gabriel Boric, un antiguo activista estudiantil de 35 años, venció a un rival de extrema derecha con la promesa de aumentar los impuestos a los ricos para ofrecer pensiones más generosas y ampliar enormemente los servicios sociales. La tendencia no ha sido universal. En los últimos tres años, los votantes de El Salvador, Uruguay y Ecuador han desplazado a sus gobiernos hacia la derecha. Y en México y Argentina, el año pasado, los partidos de centroizquierda perdieron terreno en las elecciones legislativas, socavando a sus presidentes. Pero en general, Evan Ellis, profesor de estudios latinoamericanos en el Colegio de Guerra del Ejército de Estados Unidos, dijo no recordar una América Latina “tan dominada por una combinación de izquierdistas y líderes populistas antiestadounidenses”. “En toda la región, los gobiernos de izquierda estarán particularmente dispuestos a trabajar con los chinos en contratos de gobierno a gobierno”, dijo, y posiblemente “con respecto a la colaboración en materia de seguridad, así como a la colaboración tecnológica”. Jennifer Pribble, profesora de ciencias políticas de la Universidad de Richmond que estudia América Latina, dijo que el brutal número de víctimas de la pandemia en la región hizo que las iniciativas de izquierda, como las transferencias de efectivo y la atención universal a la salud, fueran cada vez más populares. “Los votantes latinoamericanos tienen ahora un sentido más agudo de lo que el Estado puede hacer y de la importancia de que el Estado participe en un esfuerzo redistributivo y en la prestación de servicios públicos”, dijo. “Eso condiciona estas elecciones, y está claro que la izquierda puede hablar más directamente de eso que la derecha”. En Colombia, donde las elecciones presidenciales se celebrarán en mayo, Gustavo Petro, exalcalde izquierdista de Bogotá que perteneció a un grupo guerrillero urbano, ha mantenido una ventaja constante en las encuestas. Sergio Guzmán, director de la consultora Colombia Risk Analysis, dijo que las aspiraciones presidenciales de Petro se hicieron viables después de que la mayoría de los combatientes de las FARC, un grupo guerrillero marxista, dejaron las armas como parte de un acuerdo de paz alcanzado en 2016. El conflicto había dominado durante mucho tiempo la política colombiana, pero ya no. “El tema ahora es la frustración, el sistema de clases, la estratificación, los que tienen y los que no tienen”. Justo antes de Navidad, Sonia Sierra, de 50 años, se encontraba fuera de la pequeña cafetería que regenta en el principal parque urbano de Bogotá. Sus ingresos se habían desplomado, dijo, primero en medio de la pandemia y luego cuando una comunidad desplazada por la violencia se trasladó al parque. Sierra dijo que estaba muy endeudada después de que su marido fuera hospitalizado con covid. Las finanzas son tan ajustadas que hace poco despidió a su única empleada, una joven venezolana que solo ganaba 7,50 dólares al día. “Tanto trabajar y no tengo nada”, dijo Sierra, cantando un verso de una canción popular en la época navideña en Colombia. “No estoy llorando, pero sí, me da sentimiento”. En el vecino Brasil, el aumento de la pobreza, la inflación y una respuesta fallida a la pandemia han convertido al presidente Jair Bolsonaro, el titular de extrema derecha, en un candidato débil de cara a la votación programada para octubre. El expresidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, un izquierdista que gobernó Brasil de 2003 a 2010, una época de notable prosperidad, ha conseguido una ventaja de 30 puntos porcentuales sobre Bolsonaro en un cara a cara, según una encuesta reciente. Maurício Pimenta da Silva, de 31 años, subgerente de una tienda de suministros agrícolas en la región de São Lourenço, en el estado de Río de Janeiro, dijo que se arrepentía de haber votado por Bolsonaro en 2018 y que ahora tiene la intención de apoyar a Da Silva. “Pensé que Bolsonaro mejoraría nuestra vida en algunos aspectos, pero no lo hizo”, dijo Da Silva, un padre de cuatro hijos que no tiene relación con el expresidente. “Todo es tan caro en los supermercados, especialmente la carne”, agregó, lo que lo llevó a tomar un segundo empleo. Con los votantes enfrentados a tanta agitación, los candidatos moderados están ganando poca influencia, lamentó Simone Tebet, una senadora de centroderecha en Brasil que planea presentarse a la presidencia este año. “Si miramos a Brasil y a América Latina, estamos viviendo un ciclo de extremos relativamente aterrador”, dijo. “El radicalismo y el populismo se han impuesto”."
23,The New York Times,nytimes,"According to analysts, the advances from the left in Colombia and Brazil could make it difficult for the United States to continue isolating the authoritarian leftist regimes in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba.",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3pUIv7A%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2YaDyalcGvPaqGmGmdUyzylv2W1Lkv5lClG7boL2NVvUoer7xSzmMIEVg&h=AT1ujPT_74Ay4_BBGcP4dS5Uy3tq1SV1-IafESrgnw4dUqIfRvH7nF5uHU_jvm0L2pMG90_vvV8X6gTS-8HtNZAuSFoRmlzLQ1baALQ5hskoPUF8eU6IdUboDOqRnNqJHW7WED3_UEpjqp7z7Rgg&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT3munjvs_iDsiMxmJkSzhENc5Ce1xP-sZ208Ub2FBZQHxK4-99xpApiG8HF9eWJGVmhL_9UJyEAa0_PiM57FENeH0J24XeepWiS3GVyhrl1YNmV4ojy29yxbpjhX99Ffg_bx8P3L_N5WoJK1kRUQgvood6GmBfrd-N6UnEQHDJuuU1G,1d,"The running backs in today’s N.F.L., Eric Dickerson said, are fine. But none — not Jonathan Taylor, not Ezekiel Elliott, not Derrick Henry — remind him of himself. “I’m not saying that to be boastful,” Dickerson said. “No one ran like I ran.” With a distinctive upright running style — and wearing Rec Specs and a neck roll — Dickerson rushed for 13,259 yards, mostly for the Rams and Colts. When he retired, in 1993, that total ranked second in N.F.L. history. It’s now good for ninth, but even three decades later, Dickerson, 61, still holds three significant records: No one has rushed for more yards as a rookie (1,808), in a playoff game (248) or in a single season (2,105). Dickerson, whose memoir, “Watch My Smoke,” comes out this month, discussed in a telephone interview why he thinks those records won’t fall for a while, if ever; the N.C.A.A.’s decision to allow college athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness; and whether he’ll let his son play tackle football. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and condensed. Before Derrick Henry got hurt, did you think he would break your single-season rushing record? [Henry fell 78 yards short of the record in the 2020 season and had been expected to challenge it in 2021, with the addition of a 17th regular-season game to the N.F.L. schedule. Dickerson set the record in the 1984 season.] In all honesty, no. There’s just something about that record, I don’t know what it is. Maybe it’s supposed to last longer, or maybe my lifetime. I kept telling guys, a big part of it is you can’t fall behind, you can’t get hurt. I most definitely didn’t want to see Derrick Henry get hurt. I’d rather see him break my record all day long than get hurt. I just didn’t think he’d break it. I didn’t think Adrian Peterson would break it when he got close. Why not? When he was trying for it, I was at Toys “R” Us with my little girl. She was maybe 4 or 5, then. Jackie Slater calls me and he’s blowing my phone up like: ‘Man, you watching this game? What the hell you doing at Toys “R” Us, A.P.’s gonna get the record.’ I said, ‘He ain’t gonna get it.’ I just had a feeling. And sure enough, what did he wind up? Nine yards short? [Peterson finished 8 yards short in 2012.] The one I think is going to last is that 1,808, that rookie record. It’s so hard for a rookie to come in and do it. And you almost didn’t set the single-season mark because you got turf toe in Week 8. Oh, most definitely. I mean, my toe still bothers me to this day. I couldn’t walk on it at all. I couldn’t even touch it. Like a bedsheet, if it touched it, it was like dropping a book on it. Gary Tuthill, the trainer, was the one who came up with the idea for a toe piece. I still have my toe piece right here, two of them. It saved my career because I played with it my whole career. I could not play without it. A toe is a debilitating injury. People don’t realize. You don’t even think about a toe. But it’s a horrible injury if you have to put pressure on it, push off it being a running back or offensive lineman. You can’t do it. Have you imagined how different it would be if you played today, with the N.C.A.A. permitting college athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness? That’s way overdue. It’s sad because it should have been like that years ago. I think about myself. I think about guys before me that were poor Black kids that were just trying to help their family out, the little bit they could. Wasn’t like we were getting rich. They vilified you for it. They made you out to be a bad guy. But you come from nothing. You’re trying to help out a little bit with what you have as a talent. We didn’t have anything. I was trying to help my mother out. My dad died when I was 17 years old. For me, people think I made all this money at S.M.U. Come on, seriously. I got $1,000 a month. Sometimes it was $500. I was trying to help my mother out. She was an older lady still cleaning houses. [The N.C.A.A. levied against S.M.U. the so-called “death penalty,” canceling the football program for the 1988 season, after an investigation found repeated recruiting violations including facilitating payments to players.] Your passion for that transfers over to your advocacy for better health benefits for retired N.F.L. players, it feels like. Let me tell you something: The N.F.L. is another no-good entity. I bet if you talked to 100 players, I bet you 85 to 90 of them are going to say they hate the N.F.L. I just think that’s sad. I heard the other day from two guys. What’s ironic about it is these are white guys. They say the same thing that we Black guys say: They just want you to go somewhere and die. They don’t want to help you, they don’t give a damn about you. When we came up in the league, we had no health care. I was able to pay for my health care — still am paying for my health care. But think about guys who can’t pay. I know one guy, Drew Hill. He passed away because he didn’t have enough money to pay for his high blood pressure medication. In your book, you discuss football’s impact on your body and brain. How are you doing? I have good days and bad days. I can’t sleep. Last time I had a really good night’s sleep was about three years ago and I slept on a plane going from L.A. to London. I can remember it, I remember very well. Sometimes I may sleep two hours, I may sleep four hours. I just went to a sleep apnea place to see if I have it. It’s horrible, man. I know for me, I won’t have a long life living like this, not being able to sleep. It just won’t happen. People ask would I do it all over again if I knew what would happen. Yeah, I would do it and I’d do it for one reason: My mom. I’d do it for Viola Dickerson. It gave my mother and my family a life they never would have had. And me, too. Are you at all concerned that you have chronic traumatic encephalopathy (C.T.E.)? I mean, I’m sure. I know I do, some form of it. Not advanced yet. But sometimes I have a short fuse and sometimes I don’t. Something small, like a guy blows a horn at me, and man, my insides go ballistic. I mean, I’ll go crazy. Like, crazy crazy. We guys talk about that, how you have that short fuse. That’s the football, the aggressiveness. I’ll get real aggressive. I don’t like that. I don’t like to act like that. Because once I start, I can’t stop. It’s almost embarrassing, it’s uncontrollable. It’s almost like the Incredible Hulk. I cannot control myself. I don’t care if the pope was here, I’m going to curse and go ballistic. And I don’t like to act like that. Knowing what you do, will you let your son play tackle football? Well, he’s 9 years old, and he plays flag football. I’ve talked to him about football. I said: ‘Listen, you’re playing flag. There’s going to come a point where it’s tackle.’ He says, ‘Dad, I understand.’ I said: ‘No, there’s going to be hits and tackling. It’s going to be more physical.’ If he wants to play, would I let him play? Yeah, probably. I would. I wouldn’t want to stop him. But I want to give him everything he has to work with to know how dangerous that sport is."

The two harmful pollutants are a result of worsening wildfires and extreme heat, and researchers suggest the increase is linked to climate change. “These trends are congruent with what you would expect with a warming and drying climate,” said Dmitri A. Kalashnikov, a doctoral student at Washington State University Vancouver and the lead author of a study that analyzed summer air pollution data from 2000 to 2020. “We would expect to see more of these kinds of widespread co-occurring air pollution events in the Western U.S.” Surface-level ozone is a large component of smog, and is produced when vehicle and other emissions react with sunlight, especially on hot summer days. Smoke contains fine soot particles, and much of this kind of pollution, called PM2.5 because it is smaller than 2.5 micrometers, comes from wildfires. High levels of either pollutant can affect the lungs and cardiovascular system, aggravate chronic diseases like asthma and lead to premature death. “But when they both occur at once, then you’re getting the worst of both worlds,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and another author of the study, which was published in Science Advances. Dr. Swain said the idea for the research came about through discussions among colleagues. “All of us live in the West and all of us have experienced, along with everyone else, these extreme wildfire smoke episodes in recent years,” he said. And it seemed possible that more days of extreme smoke would coincide with days of high ozone. “So we really just said, OK, but to what extent is this actually the case?” he said. The researchers looked at simultaneous occurrences of high levels of both smoke and ozone and linked the geographic extent of these events to the extent of wildfires and extreme hot weather. Overall, the study found that between 2000 and 2020, millions of people in the Western United States were exposed to more days of combined harmful smoke and ozone pollution each year. The researchers also found a connection between the pollution and patterns of atmospheric “ridging,” the development of stagnant zones of high-pressure air. These zones, sometimes called heat domes, lead to increasing heat and drying that can cause wildfires to ignite and spread more readily, and can also cause dangerous heat waves. The frequency of these ridging patterns has increased significantly since 2000, according to the new research. The study analyzed data only through 2020. “But I think 2021 would show up pretty high on some of these metrics, too,” Mr. Kalashnikov said. There were several enormous wildfires in the West last summer that spread smoke across the West, and extreme heat and drought persisted throughout the region. Colleen Reid, a health geographer at the University of Colorado who has studied the combined effects of wildfire smoke and ozone but was not involved in this research, said the findings showed that the seasonality and extent of PM2.5 pollution in the West is changing and now overlapping more with high-ozone days. “What has been happening a lot lately is that we’ve been having really bad air quality as well as extreme heat,” she said. Dr. Reid said the study also highlights how heat has to be taken into account when it comes to helping the public cope with air pollution, because the recommended public health measures for extreme heat and extreme air pollution can be completely opposite, especially for those who cannot afford air conditioning. “When it’s hot, you want to open your windows so that you don’t overheat in your home,” Dr. Reid said. “But when the air quality is bad, you want to close your windows to keep as much of the air pollution out.” Dr. Swain said that with wildfires, the short-term dangers to individuals and communities usually get the most attention. But this study looks at the longer-term risks to the broader public. “Something may not necessarily have a high likelihood of killing you personally in the short term,” he said. “But if you impose that same risk on tens of millions of people over and over again, the societal burden is actually very high.”"

Kyli Hilaire, a barista at the store, which is in Elmwood in the Buffalo area, said that it was understaffed, that workers were struggling to enforce masking rules and that many of them were anxious about their health as they watched Covid-19 case counts spike in the region. “One of our requests was to close the store to let the outbreak of Covid run its course so we can return with a full staff rather than burning out the partners who are able to work,” Ms. Hilaire, 20, said. “They’re refusing to take the necessary precautions so our partners are not coming to work sick.” The walkout, involving about half a dozen employees, will last the rest of the week, she added. The company said it had not determined whether the store would stay open. Starbucks regional leaders met with union members on Tuesday night to discuss their safety concerns, which had mounted after an employee at the Elmwood store tested positive for the coronavirus. The company said all employees who had been in close contact with the infected person had been notified and given the option to quarantine themselves for five days with pay while monitoring for symptoms or awaiting Covid test results. “We have met and exceeded all C.D.C. and expert guidelines for safety,” said Reggie Borges, a Starbucks spokesman, adding that the company was giving store and district managers leeway to adjust their operations in response to the fast-spreading Omicron variant of the virus. “All leaders are empowered to make whatever changes make sense for their neighborhood, which includes shortening store hours or moving to 100 percent takeout only, which is the case in Buffalo.” Starbucks announced on Monday that it would reduce the number of days that vaccinated, asymptomatic workers who tested positive for the virus must isolate themselves to five days from 10, following a shift in guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The company also said this week that all of its U.S. workers had to be vaccinated by Feb. 9 or submit to weekly testing, in compliance with the Biden administration’s vaccine rule for large employers. When the Starbucks workers in Elmwood voted to form their union last month, in an election recognized by the National Labor Relations Board, the result represented a challenge to the company’s long-running argument that its workers enjoy good wages and do not need a union. “It was kind of crazy walking out of work,” Ms. Hilaire added. “It was a first for everyone.”"

By shocking the nation with a vulgarity three months before presidential elections, Mr. Macron was relaying not only a public health message, but also a political one. He appeared to be calculating that tapping into the growing public anger against the unvaccinated held more potential electoral rewards than the risk of angering an anti-vaccination minority whose support he has little hope of ever getting. Using his harshest language yet to urge the recalcitrant to get their shots, Mr. Macron said he would not “throw them in prison” or “vaccinate them by force.” But he made it clear he meant to make their lives harder. In doing so, Mr. Macron, an inveterate political gambler who became the nation’s youngest elected leader five years ago, effectively kicked off his campaign for re-election Wednesday, drawing clear lines between his supporters and opponents. He also moved the focus of debate away from themes like immigration and Islam that have dominated the political race so far and that are advantageous to his strongest rivals, on the right and far right. Mr. Macron was clearly seeking to tap into a rich political vein that his counterparts have been more cautious to exploit: anger among the majority of vaccinated people at a minority who refuse to get vaccinated and disproportionately occupy hospital beds. More than 77 percent of French people, and 92 percent of those 12 and older, have received at least two doses, according to the government. “The unvaccinated, I really want to piss them off,” Mr. Macron said, using a French word that is more vulgar, explaining that a new, reinforced vaccine pass would make it impossible for the unvaccinated to go to restaurants and cafes, or the theater and cinemas. Their recalcitrance, as well as the surge in cases in France, is threatening to undermine his success so far in tackling the pandemic. Elsewhere in Europe — faced with the same dilemma that the pandemic might not be reined in until the unvaccinated change their minds — leaders have been more hesitant to confront groups opposed to vaccinations that are often well-organized and vocal. In Germany and Austria, the prospect of being coerced to get Covid shots has fueled angry and sometimes violent protests. Mandatory vaccination has long been dismissed as an option, not least by Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, but has increasingly gained support among politicians and virologists who say that other measures have failed to increase vaccination rates fast enough. In Germany, Mr. Scholz stressed that he was “chancellor of the unvaccinated, too.” But Germany has excluded unvaccinated people from much of public life and is now debating whether to make vaccination mandatory. Mandatory vaccination is also scheduled to come into effect next month in Austria. In Italy, the government is planning to introduce new measures to reduce the number of unvaccinated, possibly making shots mandatory for those over 60. But Italy’s large coalition government is struggling to find consensus on the measures, split between center-left groups that are in favor of mandatory vaccination and right-wing parties that are against it. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain has not applied significant pressure on the unvaccinated, instead preferring to try to persuade Britons to get shots. That is partly because a powerful faction within Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party opposes coronavirus restrictions on libertarian grounds, or worries about their economic impact. “Clearly, there are a number of leaders who don’t know anymore what to do,” said Adrien Abécassis, who has written about the politics of vaccination and is the head of research at Paris Peace Forum, an organization focusing on international governance. By contrast, in France, Mr. Macron has steadfastly stuck to a policy of vaccinating as many people as possible, Mr. Abécassis said, “So there is strong legitimacy in having the highest possible vaccination rate. The strategy from the start has been to impose social sanctions of exclusion to those who don’t respect the social norm, which is to get vaccinated.” Mr. Macron’s comments were published before France again registered a record number of infections on Wednesday evening — 332,000 cases — in the previous 24 hours, as the highly contagious Omicron variant sweeps across the country and the rest of Europe. The president was also reacting to moves this week by opposition lawmakers to delay the passage in Parliament of a bill that would make it possible to obtain France’s health pass only through vaccination and no longer with a negative test. The rapid spread of Omicron has strained Mr. Macron’s successful pandemic strategy and an underlying unwritten social contract between the government and the people. In return for agreeing to get vaccinated, the government has offered the French a near-normal life since last summer, with few of the more serious restrictions that France’s neighbors have reimposed. Nearly 92 percent of French people 12 years old and over have now received at least two doses, an unexpected feat in a country that had been one of the most suspicious of vaccines just a year ago, according to polls. Mr. Macron’s bet last summer on the twin powers of vaccines and health passports proved popular and contributed to his positive approval rating — about 40 percent, a high level compared to those of his predecessors in the same period before their own bids for re-election. But about five million French, including four million adults, have yet to get a single shot. Mr. Macron’s use of a vulgar expression was clearly meant to tap into the growing anger by the overwhelming majority of vaccinated people against the unvaccinated minority, said Stewart Chau, an analyst for the polling firm Viavoice and a sociologist. “Creating divisions around the issue of the pandemic is what the president of the republic tried to do by saying out loud what others are thinking quietly,” Mr. Chau said, adding that the word would speak to a “public opinion that, after two years of a health crisis, is worn-out and exhausted” as well as more “irritable and emotional.” The president’s rivals attacked his use of the vulgarity as “unworthy of a president,” “shocking” and “divisive.” Gabriel Attal, the government spokesman, pushed back, saying that the president’s choice of language represented only a fraction of “the anger of the great majority of French people confronted with the choice to oppose vaccination.” “Let’s speak frankly — who pisses off whom?” Mr. Attal said, adding that it was those “who refuse to be vaccinated” who are “ruining the lives” of health care workers, the elderly, and those working in theaters, restaurants and other businesses. Mr. Macron studiously used the word “emmerder,” which is translated literally as “to mire in excrement” and means to “annoy” or “to give a hard time to.” Technically, Mr. Macron has yet to officially declare his candidacy for the election in April. For months, Mr. Macron has been coyly deflecting questions about his candidacy. Last month, during a long television interview, Mr. Macron said he regretted harsh words he had used in the past on other issues — and which had helped create an image of him as an elitist politician disconnected from the people. In a speech, he had once divided people into two categories: “Those who succeed and those who are nothing.” Mr. Chau, the pollster, said that Mr. Macron’s use of crude slang would probably not weaken his core support. But it could alienate the undecided by reviving Mr. Macron’s image of arrogance. “It’s the overriding character trait of Emmanuel Macron that he’s never been able to shake off,” Mr. Chau said. Mr. Macron used the crude slang — not once, but three times — in a reply to a reader of the daily newspaper “Le Parisien.” In interviews organized at the Élysée Palace, Mr. Macron replied to various questions, including to a woman who pointed out that the unvaccinated occupied most of the beds in intensive care units and prevented others, including cancer patients, from getting the care they needed. Mr. Macron said the unvaccinated were a rebellious minority whose numbers he planned to shrink by “pissing them off.” “In democracy, the worst enemies are lies and stupidity,” he said. Mr. Macron appeared to be hewing to a strategy — expressed by his allies in recent months — of portraying himself as the candidate of “reason” and solidifying his hold on the center. His words also targeted a segment of the electorate that is unlikely to vote for him, as evidenced by the strongest reaction to his choice of language, especially from the extreme left and the extreme right. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the far-left leader, accused Mr. Macron of promoting “collective punishment against individual freedom.” Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader and one of Mr. Macron’s main rivals, accused him of “waging war” on the unvaccinated. Eric Zemmour, the far-right TV pundit and another leading competitor, said Mr. Macron’s words revealed his cruelty toward a class of “despised French.”"

Flames were pouring out of the second-story windows of a rowhouse on 23rd Street as people on the block watched in horror. Firefighters arrived just before sunrise and fought the blaze for nearly an hour. They discovered what neighbors had feared: There had been people inside, a lot of them. Twelve were killed in the fire, including eight children, according to the Philadelphia mayor’s office. Craig Murphy, the deputy fire commissioner, said that two others who were hurt were taken to nearby hospitals. At a news conference down the street from the charred building, Mayor Jim Kenney, the son of a firefighter, seemed almost at a loss for words. “This is, without a doubt, one of the most tragic days in our city’s history,” he said. “Losing so many kids is just devastating.” As the sun set on Wednesday, Jacuita Purifoy stood before reporters on the street and said that three of her sisters were among the dead, along with her nieces and nephews. “I’ve been in and out of conscious all day,” said Ms. Purifoy, who heard the news at around 7 a.m. The only member of the family who lived in the building that Ms. Purifoy knew to have survived was a 5-year-old boy. He was in a hospital in stable condition, she said, and asking about his family. “They was somebody,” Ms. Purifoy said of her sisters. “They was relevant, they was somebody who was supposed to continue life and die at an old age, not from stuff that could have been avoided.” Officials said they did not yet know the cause of the fire, though an investigation was underway. It was among the deadliest residential fires in the country’s recent history, including a 2019 fire that killed five children at a day care center in Erie, Pa., and a 2018 fire at an apartment building in Chicago that left 10 children dead. The century-old, three-story brick rowhouse belonged to the Philadelphia Housing Authority, which bought it in 1967, according to property records. It had been divided into two units: one on the first floor and half of the second; the other sharing the second floor and taking up the third. Altogether, Mr. Murphy said, it appeared that 26 people were in the building at the time of the fire, eight in the lower unit and 18 in the upper one. “That is a tremendous amount of people to be living in a duplex,” said Mr. Murphy, though he emphasized that this was not a definitive number. He said that eight people who were in the building escaped the fire on their own. The city had initially reported the death toll as 13, including seven children, but revised both figures on Wednesday evening. An official with the housing authority said it was unclear why so many people were in the building. This would have been “too high” a number of occupants for an apartment, Dinesh Indala, the executive vice president for housing operations at the housing authority, told reporters. He did not specify how many people could legally live in the unit, and also cautioned that much was still unknown about who was inside at the time of the fire. “It’s the holidays,” he said. “I don’t know if they had people coming and visiting. I have no idea.” Jenna Collins, a housing lawyer with Community Legal Services in Philadelphia, said the maximum occupancy for the largest units operated by the housing authority was 12 people. But she said that complications of life can render the rules less than hard-and-fast at times; for example, if a person in a unit suddenly gains custody of several children, the family is typically not evicted while waiting for a larger place to open up. In any case, as the mayor and others cautioned, it was too early to make any judgments about the living arrangements in the apartment. “You don’t know the circumstances of each and every family,” Mr. Kenney said at the news conference. “Maybe there were people or relatives that needed to be sheltered.” Mr. Murphy said that the apartments had smoke detectors but of those that responders found, “none of them operated.” Both apartments had been inspected by the housing authority within the past year, officials said. In a statement, Kelvin Jeremiah, the president of the housing authority, said that all smoke detectors had been found to be working when the property was inspected in May 2021. Officials said it was too early to say why they apparently did not work on Wednesday — a problem that has apparently bedeviled the housing authority for some time. “I don’t know if they were replaced or tampered with — we have no idea,” Mr. Indala said. Darrell L. Clarke, the president of the Philadelphia City Council, said that larger public housing complexes in the city require hard-wired smoke detectors, but that these were battery-operated. Mr. Clarke represents the district where the fire happened and said that several of the children who died were students at a nearby elementary school, where families gathered on Wednesday morning. “It is really a gut punch, not only to the family members but to the community and the city of Philadelphia,” he said. Fairmount is a mostly gentrified neighborhood of modest brick rowhouses that sits north and east of some of the city’s most prestigious museums and just south of Brewerytown, a poorer neighborhood. For some living on the block where the fire broke out, the morning unfolded in a series of shocks: the blaze itself, the death toll and the discoveries about the lives of their neighbors. “I had no idea there were that many people in the building,” said Laurie Roma, 44, who lives across the street from the blaze and had awakened to the sound of screaming. “I knew there were kids that resided in the home. I knew it was a P.H.A. home. And I just was hoping that everyone got out.” She said that she had tried calling 911 that morning but no one answered, and that a neighbor also said there had been trouble getting through. A spokesman for the city said 911 had received the first calls about the fire at 6:36 a.m. and fielded dozens of calls after that. The first firefighters arrived on the scene at 6:40. But for 12 people it was already too late. “We just were, you know, coming together stronger than previous,” Ms. Purifoy said on Wednesday evening. The family had recently lost their father, she said, which had brought them even closer. “We always stayed together because we were a family. We weren’t just, you know, people that’s just out here saying, ‘Oh that’s my cousin, that’s my sister’ and then they don’t know what’s going on in each other’s life.” Up the street from the burned-out building, Sumara Wright, 18, stood outside the elementary school, having walked over that morning to pick up laptops for her siblings so they could work remotely. A teacher told her about the fire, and that one of the victims was Ms. Wright’s close friend and classmate. He and his siblings had been in the building that morning. “It was heartbreaking,” Ms. Wright said. “I had just seen him two days ago riding his bike.”"

Ms. Cornish announced her departure on Twitter on Tuesday, saying she was “joining many of you in ‘The Great Resignation’” and adding that she was “ready to stretch my wings and try something new.” NPR said her last day will be Friday. Ms. Cornish, who started at NPR as a reporter on the national desk in 2005, has hosted “All Things Considered,” the broadcaster’s flagship news program, since 2012. “I look forward to new opportunities and new ways to tell stories and to keep finding ways to make space and center the voices of those who have been traditionally left out,” Ms. Cornish wrote on Twitter. Her decision to leave her job comes after the recent exits of other prominent NPR hosts of color, including the host Noel King, who went to Vox Media, and Lulu Garcia-Navarro, who joined The New York Times. Ari Shapiro, Ms. Cornish’s co-host on “All Things Considered,” said in a tweet on Tuesday that he was on vacation and not available for comment. He added that he would refer any journalists to NPR’s communications department for comment “on why we’re hemorrhaging hosts from marginalized backgrounds.” “If NPR doesn’t see this as a crisis,” Mr. Shapiro said in a tweet, “I don’t know what it’ll take.” Isabel Lara, NPR’s chief communications officer, said in a statement, “We’re focused not only on those who choose to leave NPR, but also who is deciding to come.” “Diversity in our staff, sourcing and coverage is not only crucial to the accuracy and fairness of NPR’s content, but to the future of public media and our audience at large,” she added.

The director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, had faced previous criticism for issuing recommendations that confused the public and in some cases caught the White House off guard. Determined to avoid that this time, she briefed other top Biden health officials on her proposal so they would all be on the same page, according to two people familiar with her actions. It did not work out that way. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, and Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, the surgeon general, were concerned that the new guidance did not urge people to get a negative Covid test before ending their isolation. After the new recommendation became public, they both took issue with it on national television, saying they expected the C.D.C. to clarify its advice. On Wednesday, nine days after the guidance was issued and a day after it was slightly modified to include some advice on testing, the C.D.C. was still having a hard time explaining itself. “How do you expect people to keep track of what they can and can’t do?” a CNN reporter demanded of Dr. Walensky at a White House briefing. It was a familiar refrain. President Biden came into office vowing to restore public trust in the C.D.C. after the Trump White House had tied the agency’s hands and manipulated its scientific judgments on the pandemic for political ends. Yet in his first year of battling the coronavirus, Mr. Biden has presided over a series of messaging failures that have followed a familiar pattern, with Dr. Walensky and her team making what experts say are largely sound decisions, but fumbling in communicating them to America. Dr. Walensky, a highly regarded infectious disease expert from Boston with no prior government experience, insisted in February that schools must keep students six feet apart; in March, she said three feet was enough. She said in February that teachers did not need to be vaccinated to reopen schools; the White House said the next day that she was speaking “in her personal capacity.” In May, she said that vaccinated people generally did not need to wear masks in public, a sudden change that flummoxed state health officials. Two months later, she reversed that guidance after it was shown that vaccinated people could still transmit the virus. With the virus throwing one curveball after another, changing advice from the C.D.C. is a given. But Dr. Walensky’s critics say the C.D.C.’s recommendations are sometimes so confusing or abruptly modified that they seem more like drafts than fully vetted proclamations. “I don’t think that the C.D.C. guidelines were significantly wrong,” Dr. Tom Frieden, the agency’s director under former President Barack Obama, said of the latest recommendations on isolation for those with Covid. But he added, “I think the way they were released was very problematic.” The crux of the problem, several administration officials said, is a failure by the C.D.C. and the Biden administration’s messaging experts to work in concert. Who is to blame for that is a matter of debate. Dr. Walensky’s critics say she is not collaborative enough, too often springing decisions on other federal officials who then struggle to defend them in public. Her defenders say she strives to coordinate, but that it is not her job to ensure consensus across the entire administration. Some suggest the White House has gone too far in its hands-off, let-the-scientists-rule approach, leaving a vacuum of leadership and forcing ad-hoc coordination between the various public health agencies. That has been exacerbated by a health secretary, Xavier Becerra, who receives routine briefings from scientists but does not settle interagency disputes about the pandemic response. Dr. Fauci, the administration’s best-known spokesman on the pandemic, has further muddied the waters at times, publicly contradicting the C.D.C. as he did this week or making statements he has later walked back. He said in late December, for instance, that a vaccination requirement for domestic airline passengers should be seriously considered, leaving the White House to field a flurry of questions on a policy it was not prepared to recommend. Later, he said a mandate was unlikely. On Wednesday, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said it was OK for the C.D.C. to modify its guidance, adding that, for one thing, “if they hadn’t changed their recommendations over the course of time, schools would probably be closed across the country.” But even some within Dr. Walensky’s own agency agree that the C.D.C.’s public pronouncements on the pandemic have repeatedly fallen short, long after experts say the agency should have mastered clear and concise public messaging on the worst public health crisis in a century. The handling of the isolation guidance was a case study in how to confuse the public. And the controversy is not over: health experts continued on Wednesday to criticize the C.D.C.’s decision not to recommend a negative test before people with Covid end a five-day isolation. “The new recommendations on quarantine and isolation are not only confusing, but are risking further spread of the virus,” the American Medical Association said in a statement on Wednesday. Dr. Walensky said that she and career staff finished devising the guidance over the Christmas weekend. Officials decided that people with Covid-19 could end their isolation after five days instead of 10 if they were asymptomatic or if their symptoms were “resolving,” meaning no fever for 24 hours. The agency said 85 to 90 percent of viral transmission occurred within that initial five-day period.  Dr. Walensky verbally briefed other senior federal officials on the new guidance at least twice that weekend, defending her decision not to recommend that people test negative first. One person familiar with Dr. Walensky’s account said no one raised serious objections. But Dr. Fauci said in an interview that he did not see the final version before it was released. Others familiar with the situation said the C.D.C. did not share it before posting it publicly on Dec. 27. Although the Food and Drug Administration now typically holds a news briefing after major regulatory moves on Covid vaccines or treatments, the C.D.C. held no briefing on the decision. Indeed, it has not held regular news conferences since former President Donald J. Trump put an end to them in early 2020. Dr. Walensky does take questions at least once a week during the White House’s pandemic news briefings. The agency’s minimalist explanation immediately set off a fraught debate: Why not recommend a negative test before ending isolation? Was it because tests were in short supply? Was the agency shortening the isolation period to keep the economy running instead of for science-based reasons? “Where the messaging gets muddled is where it is unclear what is driving the decision,” said Dr. Celine R. Gounder, an infectious disease expert at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York who considers Dr. Walensky a mentor. Dr. Gounder said she and other experts suspected that a shortage of tests was behind the decision, and that if Dr. Walensky had said so, “the public health community would have been more understanding.” Dr. Walensky said Wednesday that the guidance had “nothing to do with the shortage of available tests.” In an interview with The Times last week, Dr. Walensky said the advice was carefully crafted with a team of career officials. She said rapid tests were meant to diagnose infection, not predict the risk of spreading it — a position echoed by the F.D.A., which regulates the tests. “They’re not authorized for that use. They haven’t been studied for that,” Dr. Walensky said. “So, in my sort of clinical judgment, and my public health judgment, you don’t necessarily do a test if you don’t know what you’re going to do with the results.” In an interview Tuesday evening, Dr. Fauci said he favored a testing recommendation because a positive test was “very much associated” with the virus replicating in a person’s nose and throat — an indication of infectiousness. Two people familiar with Dr. Murthy’s thinking said he shared Dr. Fauci’s views.  Dr. Fauci said he had shared his opinion with Dr. Walensky in “very collegial, cooperative conversations” in which they discussed amending the guidance. In the end, the agency largely stuck to its stance. But the more detailed guidance, issued on Tuesday, states that if people with Covid have access to testing and want to be tested, the best approach is to take a rapid test near the end of the five-day isolation period. Asked why she changed it, Dr. Walensky said at Wednesday’s White House briefing that “it became very clear that people were interested in using the rapid test” and therefore it made sense to tell them how best to use it. Dr. Frieden said there were three rules to putting out public health guidance: it must be technically correct, simple and workable in the real world. Dr. Walensky certainly had real-world implications to consider: Would it make sense to recommend that people take Covid tests, when they are so hard to find? And with so many people getting infected with Omicron, encouraging them all to stay home for longer than five days could cripple the economy. “Why do you put in place a recommendation that citizens can’t actually fulfill?” asked Michael T. Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota who supports Dr. Walensky’s initial guidance. Dr. Frieden, who led the C.D.C. for eight years — including during the Ebola crisis — said that in developing new guidance, he would first circulate it within the government to develop consensus among top officials. Then he would hold what he called a “murder board” — a mock question-and-answer session — to “practice for really tough questions.” Then, joined by subject-matter experts, he would face reporters. He said it was not inappropriate for the White House to offer the C.D.C. messaging advice, so long as it did not interfere in scientific decisions.  In an interview with The Times last month, Dr. Walensky said she had been working on improving coordination with the White House and other federal health officials, especially since May, when her statement that vaccinated people no longer needed to wear masks took some by surprise. “I didn’t have the relationships at the time then that I even have now, and certainly there are many more people in government who have many more relationships than I do,” she said. “And so that has been a learning curve.”"

The case is the latest example of Americans misusing the Paycheck Protection Program, a part of the $2.2 billion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act that Congress passed in March 2020. In the latest case, the Georgia woman, Hunter VanPelt, pleaded guilty to bank fraud in August after submitting six loan applications for a total of more than $7.9 million on behalf of companies that she owned or controlled, prosecutors said.  Prosecutors say that Ms. VanPelt, 49, whose legal name was Ellen Corkrum until 2016, lied about payroll expenses and the number of people her companies employed. She also submitted fraudulent tax records, payroll reports and bank statements, they said. Her lawyer could not be immediately contacted for comment overnight. The Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had recovered about $2.1 million of the $6 million that Ms. VanPelt received through the program. It said a bank had also seized and returned an additional $1.6 million. The giant loan program, which ran intermittently from April 2020 to May 2021, relied on banks and other lenders. To speed the lending process, the federal government waived much of the vetting that lenders traditionally do on business loans. The program has been highly susceptible to fraud. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin estimated in August that about $76 billion of its $800 billion in loans might have been taken improperly. (They also made a more conservative estimate of $38 billion.) The Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had prosecuted more than 150 defendants so far and seized more than $75 million in cash derived from fraudulent loans through the program, along with properties and luxury items. Last month, a former New York Jets wide receiver, Joshua J. Bellamy, was sentenced to 37 months in prison after he fraudulently obtained more than $1.2 million through the Paycheck Protection Program for a company that he owned. Prosecutors said that Mr. Bellamy had spent more than $100,000 of the funds on luxury goods from Dior, Gucci and other brands. He pleaded guilty in June to conspiracy to commit wire fraud."

As the contagious Omicron variant spreads through the country, public health officials have seized on extra vaccine doses as a first line of defense. Pfizer-BioNTech boosters are now authorized for any American older than 12 who is five months past his or her second dose of the vaccine. An advisory committee recommended the changes following a meeting on Wednesday. They were endorsed by Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director, on Wednesday night. Adolescents ages 12 to 15 may begin to receive boosters immediately. Adolescents ages 16 and older were already permitted to receive booster shots, but on Wednesday the C.D.C. panel strengthened the recommendation. The advisory panel followed a similar move earlier this week by the Food and Drug Administration, which authorized Pfizer-BioNtech boosters for adolescents and shortened the recommended time interval between the initial vaccine regimen and the booster. The F.D.A. also endorsed “an additional primary dose” of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for moderately or severely immunocompromised children aged 5 to 11, to be given 28 days after their second shots.  Studies suggest that vaccine side effects are minimal in children, although there is lingering concern about a link to myocarditis, a rare inflammation of the heart muscle that occurs more frequently in young men, following vaccination. In Israel, which started administering boosters to adolescents aged 12 to 15 in June and rigorously tracks side effects, the health ministry identified two cases of myocarditis, among some 41,600 adolescents in this age group who received the booster. Both children were hospitalized briefly and have fully recovered, said Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, an Israeli health official who addressed the committee. The booster dramatically reduced infection rates among children aged 12 to 15, Dr. Alroy-Preis said. Although most infected youngsters generally did not experience severe Covid disease that required hospitalization, two children — one boy and one girl — have died, she said. But while much of the committee’s discussion focused on the risks of the vaccine and its side effects, Dr. Camille Kotton, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who specializes in transplant and immunocompromised patients, said the focus should be on the disease itself, which is having a devastating effect on vulnerable and immunocompromised patients. “This is an important thing to think about — the risk of myocarditis from the disease itself,” Dr. Kotton said. Though Omicron is generally perceived as causing less severe disease, she said, she now sees numerous patients on life support. Some have died. “It’s a horrible state of affairs,” she said. “The highly infectious nature of Omicron is such that patients who have been incredibly careful the last two years have been getting infected with awful outcomes.” Dr. Katherine Poehling, director of pediatric population health at Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., expressed similar sentiments. “There are children waiting in the emergency department 18 hours and longer to get into the hospital because we’re so full,” she said. “We have parents asking us can their children get a booster dose, like older children.” But several committee members said they were increasingly disturbed that only a minority of younger children are getting vaccinated at all, and said it is critical to increase the rates and adhere to other prevention strategies, like masking. “We can’t put all of the burden on the people who are willing to get vaccinated,” said Lynn Bahta, a committee member who is a registered nurse with the Minnesota Department of Health. “When we have only half our adolescents vaccinated, that adds more burden as well. I am so concerned that the burden of disease prevention is all falling on the vaccinated and them getting the boosters.” More than 70 percent of people 12 and older in the United States are fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C. Children younger than age 5 are still not eligible for vaccination. Americans aged 18 and older who received Moderna’s vaccine can get a booster of any available coronavirus vaccine six months after the second shot. Those who received Johnson & Johnson’s single-shot vaccine may get a booster dose of any available vaccine two months after their first shot. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are both strongly preferred over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the C.D.C. has said. Only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is authorized for children ages 5 to 11; boosters are not yet recommended for this group. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday said it was not changing its definition of “full vaccination” against the coronavirus. But the agency changed its emphasis on the appropriate regimen, tweaking how it referred to the shots. The agency said that three doses of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna’s vaccines should be considered “up-to-date” inoculations, and that Johnson & Johnson recipients should receive a second dose, preferably of Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech, to also be considered up to date. The move amounted to a recommendation from federal health officials that Americans should change how they talk about vaccination schedules. People 12 years and older are eligible for boosters. “Consistent with how public health has historically viewed or even talked about how we recommend vaccines, we are now recommending that individuals stay up to date with additional doses that they are eligible for,” Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, said at a White House news briefing on Wednesday. The C.D.C. did not change the definition of what qualifies as full vaccination — a subject of intense interest to corporations, schools, state health departments and professional sports leagues, which have themselves been reconsidering what it means to be fully vaccinated. “The technical definition of ‘fully vaccinated’ — two doses of an mRNA vaccine or one dose of the J & J vaccine — has not changed,” Kristen Nordlund, a C.D.C. spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Individuals are considered fully vaccinated once they have received their primary series.” She added that the agency recommend that people “stay ‘up to date’ by receiving any additional doses they are eligible for, according to C.D.C.’s recommendations, to ensure they have optimal protection.” Parents across Chicago raced to find child care on Wednesday morning after jarring news: Classes in the nation’s third-largest public school district were canceled. The teachers’ union and Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration had failed to agree on how to keep schools open during an Omicron-fueled virus surge. Across the country, the wildly contagious Omicron variant has infected millions and complicated the return to classrooms and workplaces. But nowhere has returning to school been more acrimonious and unpredictable than in Chicago, where, after two days back in classrooms following winter break, 73 percent of teachers voted to stop reporting to work. The city responded by calling off school altogether, refusing the teachers’ call for remote instruction. With no deal reached by Wednesday evening, district officials said classes would be canceled again on Thursday. The abrupt pause in the academic calendar, rooted in years of enmity between the Chicago Teachers Union and City Hall, jumbled plans for hundreds of thousands of students and posed another major test for Ms. Lightfoot, a Democrat whose tenure has been marked by labor strife, the pandemic and a surge in homicides. “If they are in class and Covid is rampaging, that’s a problem. If they are not there and out on the streets, that’s a problem,” said Tamar Manasseh, who leads an anti-violence group in the city, and who said she was looking into ways to help children with nowhere to go during the day. “This has put us in an untenable situation.” Ms. Lightfoot, whose disagreements with the Chicago Teachers Union date back to a strike in the early months of her term, said in an interview that the two sides remained far apart as negotiations continued. Ms. Lightfoot said she intended to take legal action against the union, and on Monday evening said the city had filed an unfair labor practices complaint. The school district opened buildings for meal distribution on Wednesday and published a list of places where parents could get emergency child care. “The consequences of the union acting like this time and time again are profound,” Ms. Lightfoot said. She added, “You think about the consequences for the families to be faced with the hostage choice of either going to work or taking care of their kids and home-schooling — no parent should be put in that position.” Australia blocked Novak Djokovic, the top-ranked men’s tennis player in the world, from entering the nation ahead of the Australian Open tournament, after immigration authorities said he didn’t meet entry requirements. “Mr. Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia, and his visa has been subsequently canceled,” the Australian Border Force said in a statement. “Noncitizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa canceled will be detained and removed from Australia.” His arrival in the country on Wednesday was mired in confusion after an airport dispute about the validity of his visa and questions about the evidence supporting an exemption from being vaccinated. Australia allows travelers who can show proof either of vaccination or of a valid medical reason for not being vaccinated to enter the country without quarantining. Djokovic, an outspoken critic of vaccine mandates, has not said publicly whether he has been vaccinated against the coronavirus. But he announced on Tuesday that he had received a medical exemption from the Australian Open’s vaccine mandate to defend his title in Melbourne, where the year’s first major tennis tournament is played. Tournament officials confirmed that in a statement on Tuesday, saying his application had been reviewed by two independent panels, a procedure that strongly suggested that he was unvaccinated. An Australian newspaper, The Age, reported that a plane carrying Djokovic landed at Tullamarine Airport in Melbourne around 11:30 p.m. local time on Wednesday, and that Djokovic, who is Serbian, was still being questioned by officials from the Australian Border Force more than six hours later. Kyrie Irving, the star Nets guard, made his regular-season debut against the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night following the team’s surprise reversal of its policy to bar him from practices and road games until he received the coronavirus vaccine. Irving looked rusty early on against the Pacers, missing his first three shots. But in the second quarter in Indianapolis, he began to heat up and scored 8 straight points. Irving declined to be vaccinated for Covid-19 before the season, making him ineligible to play in New York City because of a local vaccine mandate at sports arenas that went into effect in September. The Nets, citing concerns about team chemistry, announced in October that Irving would not be permitted to play in road games either, even if laws in those cities would allow him to participate. The N.B.A. does not require players to be vaccinated. For the most part, the team has played well in Irving’s absence, and has led the Eastern Conference for much of the season. Entering Wednesday, the Nets were No. 2 in the East, behind Chicago, with a 23-12 record after losing four of their last six games. But last month, as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus began ravaging N.B.A. rosters, the Nets announced they would let Irving play in road games. Sean Marks, the team’s general manager, said at the time that the Nets were “faced with a roster that has been decimated over the course of the last several days.” Several of the Nets’ top players, including Kevin Durant and James Harden, have missed games because of the league’s virus-related health and safety protocols. Irving was immediately placed into the protocols as well. The N.B.A.’s rules say an unvaccinated player can be placed into the protocols because of a positive or inconclusive test, or a confirmed exposure to a person who had tested positive. Players can be cleared to play again through testing and isolation periods that vary according to the players’ symptoms but that can be as short as a few days. When Irving returned to action on Wednesday night, all of the Nets’ roster was available except guard Joe Harris, who is out with an ankle injury. The United States Postal Service says it wants an exemption to the federal vaccine-or-test mandate because it could hinder its ability to deliver the mail. “The Postal Service is seeking temporary relief because it wants to ensure that its ability to deliver mail and packages is not hindered amid the current disruptions in the nation’s supply chain,” Darlene Casey, a U.S.P.S. spokeswoman, said in a statement on Wednesday. In November, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued an emergency order requiring that organizations with more than 100 employees require their workers to either be vaccinated against Covid-19 or be tested weekly and subjected to stricter face-covering requirements. The U.S.P.S. formally requested a variance from that order in a letter to OSHA dated Tuesday. “We are now in the middle of our peak season (mid-October through January), which is our busiest and most challenging time of year,” Deputy Postmaster General Doug A. Tulino wrote in the letter, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times. “The American people are relying on us to timely deliver their mail and packages throughout the holiday season — which aren’t limited to holiday packages but include critical items like Treasury checks, Covid-19 tests and pharmaceuticals.” He added that the mandate was “likely to result in the loss of many employees” just when they are needed most. Such a loss “would have a potentially catastrophic impact on our ability to provide service to the American public when demand is at its highest,” Mr. Tulino wrote. The Postal Service requires all employees and contractors “who interact with the public” to wear face coverings “when there is a state, local or tribal directive in place that requires face coverings to be worn,” Mr. Tulino wrote. Face coverings are also required for employees and contractors who cannot maintain social distancing, he wrote.  Those policies apply regardless of a person’s vaccination status, he said. In the last 18 months, the Postal Service has received “only a handful of citations” related to pandemic restrictions, which, Mr. Tulino wrote, “illustrates that the Postal Service’s established Covid-19 mitigation measures have been extremely successful to date.”   Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York said she would ask the State Legislature to make the sale of drinks to go at bars and restaurants legal, cementing in law a popular emergency policy that helped the battered hospitality industry weather the first year and a half of the pandemic. In her annual state of the state address, Governor Hochul said that legalizing to-go drinks was “something our bars and restaurants have been asking for” because it was “a critical revenue stream during the lean times last year.” Her aides said she would send a bill to the Legislature during the current session. She added, “Cheers, New York.” The previous governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, had used his emergency powers during the first year of the pandemic to put in place a special “off-premises privileges” rule allowing to-go alcohol sales. The measure was intended to throw a lifeline to the struggling food and beverage industry. Customers quickly grew accustomed to the convenience of takeout drinks. But the rule died when the state of emergency ended last June and the Legislature did not pass a measure that would extend it. Several other states, including Iowa and Arizona, have legalized the sale of takeout alcohol during the pandemic. Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, welcomed the news that Ms. Hochul would push for legislative action on the issue this year. “The drinks to go policy provides critically important revenue streams to struggling restaurants and bars and is extraordinarily popular with the public, unsurprisingly,” he said in a statement. Mr. Rigie added, “We commend Governor Hochul for her leadership, and we look forward to toasting her administration and the State Legislature once this important policy is reinstated.” The announcement on Wednesday came as the highly contagious Omicron variant has driven cases to record highs in New York State. New daily cases were averaging more than 66,000 by Jan. 4, according to a New York Times database. The Italian government made Covid-19 vaccination mandatory for people 50 and older on Wednesday, as it sought to curb the explosive growth in new cases because of the Omicron variant. The government also approved rules that prevent the unvaccinated from entering businesses, including banks, post offices and some stores. Previously, workers older than 50 could show proof of a negative test to do their jobs. Now they will have to be vaccinated or show proof they have recovered from an infection. The measures go into effect on Feb. 15. “We want to curb the growth of infections and push the Italians who haven’t gotten vaccinated yet to do so,” Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, said in a statement on Wednesday. “We are targeting in particular age groups that are at higher risk of being hospitalized to reduce the pressure on hospitals and save lives.” Mr. Draghi added that the government’s goal was to keep hospitals working while, at the same time, keeping schools and businesses open. With new infections rising fast, scientists fear that hospitals may soon have to shut down regular activities to devote beds and personnel to Covid patients. Almost 7 percent of Italians over 50 are estimated to have not received any vaccination yet. Vaccination rates are high in Italy, the first country outside China to be severely hit by the pandemic. But there still are millions of unvaccinated people. The government also set aside 92.5 million euros, or about $104.6 million, for free rapid testing in schools to lessen the effect of the virus and avoid the huge use of remote learning, said the education minister, Patrizio Bianchi. A small, new real-world study suggests that two widely used at-home antigen tests, the Abbott BinaxNOW and Quidel QuickVue, may fail to detect some Omicron infections even when people are carrying high levels of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, focused on 30 people infected with the virus at five workplaces that experienced what were most likely outbreaks of the Omicron variant in December. The people received both saliva-based P.C.R. tests and rapid antigen tests using nasal swabs. It took three days, on average, for people to test positive on a rapid antigen test after their first positive P.C.R. result. In four cases, people transmitted the virus to others while the rapid test showed the negative result, according to the study, which was conducted by several members of the Covid-19 Sports and Society Working Group. It is not clear whether the infections were missed because the antigen tests are inherently less sensitive to Omicron or because saliva tests may be better at detecting the new variant. But the results are consistent with other preliminary evidence that the at-home tests that many Americans have come to rely on — at least as currently administered, with a nasal swab — may fail to detect some Omicron cases in the first days of infection. The researchers said they shared their results with federal officials — including at the White House, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — in real-time, as the outbreaks were occurring last month. The study comes a week after the Food and Drug Administration released its own update on the effectiveness of the rapid antigen tests. “Early data suggests that antigen tests do detect the Omicron variant but may have reduced sensitivity,” the agency said. President Biden’s coronavirus response coordinator said Wednesday that, beginning next week, Americans struggling to get tested for the coronavirus will be able to have the cost of rapid at-home tests reimbursed by their insurers, but offered no specific promises about when free tests would be available. The remarks by Jeff Zients, who leads the White House pandemic response, come two weeks after Mr. Biden said his administration would buy half a billion rapid tests to distribute free to the public, and that insurance companies would begin reimbursing people for tests they purchased on their own. Mr. Biden said at the time that the free tests would be available “in the coming weeks.” With the Omicron variant of the coronavirus fueling a sharp rise in cases across the country, demand for all kinds of tests is far outpacing supply. In some areas, people are waiting in long lines to take the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., tests that are administered at medical clinics. Rapid at-home tests are flying off pharmacy shelves. “We know this remains frustrating for people getting tested in many parts of the country,” Mr. Zients said on Wednesday. “So we are working to do all we can.” The administration’s new “test to stay” guidance for schools, in which students exposed to the virus can remain in the classroom if they test negative, is among the factors driving up demand for the rapid tests. Last week, when Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, omitted a testing requirement from new isolation guidelines, she was greeted with a chorus of criticism from public health experts who said a negative test should be required before an infected person ends a five-day isolation period. On Tuesday, the C.D.C. amended the latest guidance — not to say that testing was required, but to say that people who wanted to end their isolation periods after five days and had access to tests may choose to take them. If the test results are positive, they should stay home for another five days, the guidance says; if negative, and their symptoms are resolving, they may go out, but should continue to wear masks in public for another five days. Addressing reporters on Wednesday, Dr. Walensky said she omitted a testing requirement from the guidance because rapid tests are not authorized by the Food and Drug Administration to determine whether someone is infectious to others; they are authorized merely to detect infection, and are meant to be used serially, as is the case in schools. But after the guidance was released, she said, “it became very clear that people were interested in using the rapid tests,” and since that was the case, she at least wanted to “provide guidance on how they should be used.” The recommendation for the general public is different from the one for health care workers, who are required to test negative before going back to work. Dr. Walensky said the C.D.C. was always more conservative in its recommendations for health workers, because they care for vulnerable people, including those with weak immune systems. Matching testing supply with demand has been a challenge for both the Trump and Biden administrations. Early in the pandemic, there was a shortage of tests and the components that make up test kits. By late 2020, manufacturers had expanded production. But once vaccines arrived, the Biden administration put less emphasis on testing. Demand plunged, and manufacturers pulled back. Now the manufacturers are running at full speed again. Mr. Zients said manufacturers would begin delivering rapid tests kits to the federal government next week, and that the administration would set up a “free and easy system, including a website” where Americans could order them. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Wednesday that new federal testing sites would open this week in the District of Columbia and Philadelphia, followed soon after by Maine, Maryland, Nevada, Delaware, Texas and Washington state. She noted that mobile testing sites were already open in New York City and New Jersey. LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday scaled back restrictions on people traveling to England as the Omicron variant appears to be so widespread that measures tightened in November can no longer stem the spread. Starting Friday, vaccinated travelers will no longer need to take a test before their journey, Mr. Johnson said in a statement to Parliament on Wednesday. They will still need to take one within two days of arrival, he said, though a rapid antigen test is enough. As of Sunday, the government will not require a more expensive P.C.R. test. The changes were welcomed by the country’s hard-hit aviation industry. Mr. Johnson defended the stricter travel restrictions that were put in place in late November, when the Omicron variant was first identified, as necessary to slow its arrival. “But now,” he said, “Omicron is so prevalent, these measures are having limited impact on the growth in cases, while continuing to pose significant costs on our travel industry.” The decision announced Wednesday effectively takes Britain back to the same rules it operated in October. But unvaccinated passengers will still be required to take a pre-departure test and to self-isolate on arrival for 10 days, during which time they must take two P.C.R. tests. There were 194,747 daily cases recorded in the United Kingdom, according to data released on Wednesday, near the record of 218,724 cases announced on Tuesday. Mr. Johnson’s announcement covered England only, but Wales said it would take a similar step, and Scotland and Northern Ireland were expected to follow suit. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, an industry body, said the relaxed rules were a “hugely welcome move at a critical time in the booking season for passengers.” The change would, he said in a statement, “provide a massive boost to those wanting to travel abroad or come to the U.K. this year.” He added, “People will now be able to book knowing that, for the fully vaccinated, all emergency testing restrictions have been removed.” PARIS — Faced with a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant, President Emmanuel Macron of France said Wednesday that he wanted to “piss off” millions of his citizens who refuse to get vaccinated by squeezing them out of the country’s public spaces. By shocking the nation with a vulgarity three months before presidential elections, Mr. Macron was relaying not only a public health message, but also a political one. He appeared to be calculating that tapping into the growing public anger against the unvaccinated held more potential electoral rewards than the risk of angering an anti-vaccination minority whose support he has little hope of ever getting. Using his harshest language yet to urge the recalcitrant to get their shots, Mr. Macron said he would not “throw them in prison” or “vaccinate them by force.” But he made it clear he meant to make their lives harder. In doing so, Mr. Macron, an inveterate political gambler who became the nation’s youngest leader ever five years ago, effectively kicked off his campaign for re-election Wednesday, drawing clear lines between his supporters and opponents. He also moved the focus of debate away from themes like immigration and Islam that have dominated the political race so far and that are advantageous to his strongest rivals, on the right and far right. Mr. Macron was clearly seeking to tap into a rich political vein that his counterparts have been more cautious to exploit: anger among the majority of vaccinated people at a minority who refuse to get vaccinated and disproportionately occupy hospital beds. More than 77 percent of French people, and 92 percent of those 12 and older, have received at least two doses, according to the government. “The unvaccinated, I really want to piss them off,” Mr. Macron said, using a French word that is more vulgar, explaining that a new, reinforced vaccine pass would make it impossible for the unvaccinated to go to restaurants and cafes, or the theater and cinemas. Their recalcitrance, as well as the surge in cases in France, is threatening to undermine his success so far in tackling the pandemic. RIO DE JANEIRO — While Rio de Janeiro’s renowned Carnival parade will go on, the city will cancel its street parties, which ordinarily draw millions of revelers, the mayor says, citing the Omicron variant. The freewheeling public celebrations “won’t be possible,” Mayor Eduardo Paes Casaid at a news conference on Tuesday. “It’s been decided: there won’t be street carnival in the tradition of the past.” Mr. Paes said the official parade, in which samba groups put on elaborately choreographed shows flanked by bleachers that seat 56,000 people, would be held, with some health precautions. Last year, Carnival was canceled in its entirely because of the pandemic, but for many Brazilians, the real show is the street parties, and Cariocas, as Rio residents are known, were devastated to learn that they would not take place. “I was very excited, very hopeful, for the 2022 Carnival, even more so after a year without Carnival,” said João Ramos, 26. Mr. Ramos, a designer, said that as soon as he read the news, he shared it with friends, who had already been discussing what costumes to wear. “It poured cold water on us, everyone was so sad,” he said. Still, Mr. Ramos said, the decision is understandable. Already the effect of year-end celebrations can be seen: The number of cases is ticking up again, after plunging for months. As Carnival approached, many Brazilians had begun cautiously rehearsing again, planning for that outburst of samba-fueled joy when they and millions of visitors take over public spaces and shake off the previous year’s sorrows. After two years of a pandemic, they said, it was sorely needed. “With most Brazilians fully immunized, we thought it was happening,” said Tatiana Paz, the organizer of one street performance group. “But then the situation worsened again, and there is nothing we can do about it.” Other major cities such as Olinda, São Luís, and Florianópolis have also canceled their carnival events in the past 24 hours. Rio canceled both the parade and the street parties in 2021, when Brazil’s death toll surged as its vaccination campaign was off to a slow start. But toward the end of the year, as shots became more widely available, Brazilians embraced them: About 68 percent of the country’s population is fully vaccinated, and the country’s caseload and death toll plunged. The period of relative calm that followed allowed the population to begin socializing again. Streets, beaches, and bars became packed as summer set in. On Copacabana beach, the sky was filled with fireworks as onlookers welcomed the New Year.  However, cases started rising again as Omicron spread around the world. Rio’s annual Carnival, considered to be one of the largest in the world, takes place in the weeks leading up to Ash Wednesday, the Western Christian holy day that marks the start of Lent. Ash Wednesday falls on March 2 this year. The city’s tradition, with its lively music and elaborate costumes, has endured and often thrived even in difficult times. Brazilians have danced through wars, hyperinflation, repressive military rule, runaway street violence and the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic. Official calls to postpone Carnival in Brazil in 1892 (for sanitation reasons) and 1912 (to mourn the death of a national hero) were largely ignored. In another city famous for Carnival, New Orleans, this year’s Mardi Gras parades appear to be moving forward. The event was canceled in 2021. For the second year in a row, the Grammy Awards have been pushed back by the coronavirus pandemic. The 64th annual ceremony, which had been set for Jan. 31 in Los Angeles, has been rescheduled, according to a joint statement on Wednesday from the Recording Academy and CBS, as the Omicron variant has led to a surge in cases nationwide. The new date will be announced soon, the statement said, noting, “The health and safety of those in our music community, the live audience, and the hundreds of people who work tirelessly to produce our show remains our top priority.” Last year’s show was postponed by six weeks as cases spiked, and before vaccinations were widely available. Last week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, predicted that the latest wave of the pandemic may reach its peak in the United States by the end of January. This year the composer and bandleader Jon Batiste has 11 Grammy nominations, more than any other artist, and will compete for both album and record of the year. Other top nominees include Olivia Rodrigo, Justin Bieber, Billie Eilish and Doja Cat. No performers have been announced yet. Gov. Kathy M. Hochul of New York said Wednesday that she would propose spending $10 billion to help rebuild a health care work force that has been exhausted and depleted by the nearly two-year-old pandemic. “We simply do not have enough health care workers in our hospitals, or in our long-term care facilities, in our ambulances, or in the homes of our loved ones,” the governor said in her first State of the State speech in Albany, labeling the moment a crisis.  The state health work force is about 6 percent smaller than it was before the pandemic. Even before the coronavirus strained the system, officials had projected the work force would need to grow by 11 percent by the end of 2022 to meet demand, the governor’s office reported. “We must stop the current hemorrhaging of health care workers,” Ms. Hochul said in her speech. “And we’re going to do it. Not just by saying we owe them a debt of gratitude, but actually paying them the debt we owe.” She proposed spending more than $4 billion to support wages and bonuses to increase the number of health care workers in the state by 20 percent over the next five years. That would include up to $3,000 in bonuses for all full-time health care workers who remain in their positions for a year, and $2 billion in spending on health care capital infrastructure and improved lab capacity. The governor also wants to offer free tuition to students who are preparing to work in high-demand health occupations and to provide stipends to make up for lost income while they are in school. Doctors could receive loan forgiveness up to $120,000 if they work in underserved areas for three years. She also wants to start a “Nurses Across N.Y.” Program to place nurses in underserved areas. Hospitals across the state are reporting that staffing is the biggest challenge of this stage of the pandemic, as new cases soared this week to levels not seen since the first wave in May 2020. The result has been packed emergency rooms and waits for beds at some institutions, though fewer patients are requiring intensive care because of vaccinations and what scientists say is the milder nature of the Omicron variant. As the governor spoke in Albany, the new mayor of New York, Eric Adams, laid out a plan to provide $111 million in new funding for the city’s public hospitals to help them cope with the surge in patients caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant. He also announced a $27 million loan program for the city’s so-called safety-net hospitals, which are outside the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation network. A small, new real-world study suggests that two widely used at-home antigen tests, the Abbott BinaxNow and Quidel QuickVue, may fail to detect Omicron infections when people are carrying high levels of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, focused on 30 people, who were most likely infected with Omicron, who tested positive for the virus at workplace surveillance programs. They took both saliva-based P.C.R. tests and rapid antigen tests using nasal swabs. It took three days, on average, for people to test positive on a rapid antigen test after their first positive P.C.R. result. In four cases, people transmitted the virus to others while the rapid test showed the negative result, the study noted. It is not clear whether the infections were missed because the antigen tests are inherently less sensitive for Omicron or because saliva samples may be a better way to detect the new variant. But the results suggest that the at-home tests that many Americans have come to rely on — at least as currently administered, with a nasal swab — may be failing to detect Omicron in the first days of infection. Anne Wyllie, a microbiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and a co-author of the study, urged people to interpret negative test results with caution. “People should not ignore high risk exposures,” she said. “They should not ignore symptoms.” Rapid antigen tests, which are designed to detect proteins on the surface of the coronavirus, have always been less sensitive than P.C.R. tests, which amplify the virus’s genetic material and can detect even very small traces of the virus. But in the new study, the rapid antigen tests failed to detect the virus even in people who had high viral loads, and who were thus likely to be infectious. The tests were done over a series of up to 10 days. The discordant results overwhelmingly came during the first three days of infection. The study, by researchers at the University of Washington, the Yale School of Public Health and others, concluded: “In real-world antigen testing, the limit of detection was substantially lower than manufacturers have reported to the F.D.A. based on laboratory validation.” In 29 of 30 people, samples of the virus produced a telltale genetic pattern on P.C.R. tests, suggesting that they were likely infected with Omicron. Although the study is small and has not yet been reviewed by experts, it fits with emerging research suggesting that some rapid antigen tests may be less sensitive to Omicron than to other variants. It is also consistent with a recent report from South Africa, which suggests that saliva samples might be a better way to detect Omicron than nasal swabs. The study comes a week after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released an update that made headlines by stating: “Early data suggests that antigen tests do detect the omicron variant but may have reduced sensitivity.” An Abbott spokesman, John Koval, said on Wednesday that the finding that a P.C.R. test is more sensitive is “not new.”  “Due to immediate turnaround time, frequent rapid antigen testing does slow transmission — and with a highly infectious variant frequent testing is needed, which is not realistic with P.C.R.,” he wrote in an email. Quidel’s president, Douglas Bryant, said in a statement that the company performed recent testing using samples from South Africa and confirmed that its rapid tests are detecting the Omicron variant. “The QuickVue antigen tests are able to detect the live Omicron variant with similar performance as with other variants,” he said. Hong Kong announced a series of strict pandemic control measures on Wednesday, including suspending flights from the United States and seven other countries, as it scrambled to contain an incipient coronavirus outbreak. The new measures came as the authorities held thousands of passengers of a cruise ship under mandatory quarantine to trace a Covid case. The flight bans will deepen the city’s isolation from the outside world and mark a return to the tough restrictions the city imposed in the early days of the pandemic. Hong Kong has largely brought the coronavirus under control, but the arrival of the highly transmissible Omicron variant threatens to set off the city’s fifth wave of the pandemic. “Given the very dire situation of the pandemic, we have to grasp this critical moment,” Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said at a news conference. Mrs. Lam had said on Tuesday that no new social distancing measures were expected. But the spread of Omicron, including the infection of a person with no clear connections to the city’s first detected Omicron cluster, evidently forced a change. “We have to contain the pandemic to make sure there will not be a major outbreak in the community again,” she said. “We are racing with Omicron.” The restrictions will make it even harder to enter Hong Kong, which already imposes some of the world’s longest quarantines — up to three weeks. Under the new rules, no flights will be allowed from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines or United States for two weeks, starting on Saturday. People who have recently been in those countries will also be barred from entering Hong Kong by other routes. Large public events will be canceled, and several types of public venues — including bars, gyms and karaoke parlors — will be closed. Visitors will be barred from hospitals and nursing homes for two weeks. Dining in restaurants after 6 p.m. will be banned. But the government decided not to stop in-person instruction in schools, or to require government officials to work from home. Hong Kong has reported a growing number of imported cases involving the Omicron variant, with 133 as of Tuesday.  “If this continues, there will be tremendous strain on our quarantine and health care facilities,” said Dr. Ronald Lam, Hong Kong’s director of health. An Omicron outbreak in the city has been traced to a Cathay Pacific flight attendant who ignored quarantine requirements after returning to the city from the United States. He dined at the Moon Palace restaurant in the upscale Fashion Walk shopping mall on Dec. 27, infecting his father and at least one other person, who then infected others. The restrictions came as Hong Kong health authorities on Wednesday ordered a Royal Caribbean cruise ship to return to port early as officials searched for the contacts of a Covid-19 patient. Nine people who boarded the ship, the Spectrum of the Seas, on Jan. 2 had come into contact with the patient, who did not board the ship, the government said in a statement. The nine were told to quarantine as soon as they were identified as contacts, though they preliminarily tested negative. The vessel, which was carrying about 2,500 guests and 1,200 staff members, was scheduled to return on Thursday but was back in port as ordered on Wednesday morning, a Royal Caribbean representative said. More than 3,000 passengers of the ship were subjected to mandatory quarantine, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said at a news conference on Wednesday. All crew members and guests 12 and older had to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and provide negative test results before boarding, the cruise line said in a statement. The passengers who sailed on the ship will receive a 25 percent refund on their cruise fare, it added. The cruise line also said that it had canceled another ship scheduled to depart on Thursday and that all guests who had booked it would receive a full refund. All nine of the justices on the Supreme Court have received booster shots of the coronavirus vaccine, a spokeswoman said. The justices have all been fully vaccinated since last March. The court is preparing to hear arguments on Friday in two major challenges to the Biden administration’s efforts to address the coronavirus in the workplace. As they have since the beginning of the current term in October, the justices will hear arguments on Friday in person in the Supreme Court’s courtroom. The courthouse remains closed to the public, and lawyers and credentialed journalists are required to wear N95 masks and to have recently received a negative test for the virus. The court does not require proof of vaccination. Friday’s arguments concern measures requiring vaccination or frequent testing of workers at large employers and vaccination of health care workers at facilities that receive federal money. The court will provide a live audio feed of the arguments on its website. The Sundance Film Festival announced Wednesday that it will cancel all in-person events set for Jan. 20-30. The news comes as virus cases are spiking because of the Omicron variant. The festival will now be virtual for a second year in a row. Sundance, in a news release, said it was “a difficult decision” to cancel its first hybrid festival, which would have allowed patrons to watch films either in-person in Park City, Utah, or online via a portal. The release noted that with case numbers expected to peak in Park City and the surrounding Summit County during the week of the festival, “we cannot knowingly put our staff and community at risk. The undue stress to Summit County’s health services and our more than 1,500 staff and volunteers would be irresponsible in this climate.” The news follows the announcement earlier today that the Recording Academy would postpone the Grammys, set to take place Jan. 31 in Los Angeles. In recent weeks, the Palm Springs International Film Festival canceled its event, and both the American Film Institute awards luncheon and the Critics Choice Awards, set for January, were postponed. Last year was the first time Sundance held a completely virtual event. The multiday affair was deemed a success considering the circumstances and generated one of the highest sales in the festival’s history when Apple paid $25 million for the film “CODA,” which is now looking for recognition in the awards race. The World Health Organization says that it is monitoring a coronavirus variant detected in a small number of patients in France, but that, for now, there is little reason to worry about its spread. The B.1.640.2 variant was first identified in October and uploaded to Gisaid, a database for disease variants, on Nov. 4. Only about 20 samples have been sequenced so far, experts said this week, and only one since early December. Abdi Mahmud, a Covid incident manager with the W.H.O., told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday that the variant had been on the agency’s radar since November, but added that it did not appear to have spread widely over the past two months. “That virus has had a lot of chances to pick up,” he said. By contrast, the Omicron variant, which was first uploaded to Gisaid on Nov. 23, has more than 120,000 sequences in the database. (The vast majority of Omicron cases have not been sequenced.) It has been detected in at least 128 countries, according to the W.H.O., and is fueling record-high case numbers in many parts of the world. Concerns over the variant in France arose after researchers found that it contained 46 mutations that differed from the original version of the coronavirus. Omicron also has a high number of mutations, which researchers believe made it far more transmissible. According to a research paper that was published on a preprint server in late December, but that has not been peer-reviewed, the B.1.640.2 variant was first detected in southeastern France in a vaccinated person who had recently traveled from Cameroon. Researchers found a total of 12 cases in the area and named the variant “I.H.U.,” after the research institute in Marseille that helped identify it. “It is too early to speculate on virological, epidemiological or clinical features of this I.H.U. variant based on these 12 cases,” researchers wrote. Numerous coronavirus variants have emerged over the past two years, and the reasons that some spread widely while others do not are complex. For now, several independent researchers say there is little reason to be concerned about the I.H.U. variant. Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College in London, tweeted this week that, so far, “this virus has had a decent chance to cause trouble but never really materialised.” After going virtual last year, CES, a mega-conference in Las Vegas that’s the traditional launchpad for many of the tech industry’s latest gadgets, is trying to make a comeback. The trade show kicks off on Wednesday, with an estimated 2,200 exhibitors set to show up in person. But with the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus surging, scores of major tech companies are still presenting mostly virtually. It’s a sign that decisions to hold big in-person events at this phase of the pandemic remain far from clear-cut, the DealBook newsletter reports. Yet the organizers of CES — like those of the Winter Olympics and the Australian Open, which are set to begin soon — have decided it’s time to gather in person again. Canceling the show would “hurt thousands of smaller companies, entrepreneurs and innovators” who depend on the show to introduce their products, Gary Shapiro, the chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, the trade group that organizes CES, wrote in an opinion column in The Las Vegas Review-Journal. (The conference is also important for Las Vegas, which reaped an estimated $291 million from spending tied to it in 2020.) Mr. Shapiro noted that the conference had embraced pandemic protections like requiring attendees to be fully vaccinated and masked while on the show floor, and that testing was readily available. But many large companies have chosen to attend remotely, including Amazon, AMD, AT&T, General Motors, Google, Intel, Lenovo, Meta, Nvidia, Pinterest, T-Mobile and Twitter. That will leave “big gaps on the show floor,” Mr. Shapiro said. And CES will end a day early, in what the organizers said was a concession to safety. Other big events are delaying their return to in-person gatherings. The World Economic Forum postponed its annual confab in Davos, Switzerland, which was set to take place this month. So is it safe to hold live in-person events again? Omicron cases appear to be less severe than cases from previous variants, and vaccines and new treatments are becoming available. More governments are also edging toward managing, not containing, the coronavirus, and are increasingly reluctant to reimpose restrictions. That could mean that a return to regular mass gatherings in some places may not be far-off. In hospitals around the country, doctors are taking notice: This wave of Covid seems different from the last one. Once again, as they face the highly contagious Omicron variant, medical personnel are exhausted and are contracting the virus themselves. And the numbers of patients entering hospitals with the variant are surging to staggering levels, filling up badly needed beds, delaying nonemergency procedures and increasing the risk that vulnerable uninfected patients will catch the virus. But in Omicron hot spots from New York to Florida to Texas, a smaller proportion of those patients are landing in intensive care units or requiring mechanical ventilation, doctors said. And many — roughly 50 to 65 percent of admissions in some New York hospitals — show up at the hospital for other ailments and then test positive for the virus. “We are seeing an increase in the number of hospitalizations,” said Dr. Rahul Sharma, emergency physician in chief for NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital. But the severity of the disease looks different from previous waves, he said. “We’re not sending as many patients to the I.C.U., we’re not intubating as many patients, and actually, most of our patients that are coming to the emergency department that do test positive are actually being discharged.” Though it’s still early for firm predictions, the shift in hospital patterns fits with emerging data that Omicron may be a variant with inherently milder effects than those that have come before, less prone to infecting the lungs, where it can cause serious disease. But the lower proportion of severe cases is also happening because, compared with previous variants, Omicron is infecting more people who have some prior immunity, whether through prior infection or vaccination. The vast majority of Omicron patients in I.C.U.s are unvaccinated or have severely compromised immune systems, doctors said. Hospitals, facing staff shortages, are under enormous strain. In New York City, hospitalizations have exceeded the peak of last winter’s surge. And Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, noting that the state had more hospitalized Covid-19 patients at that time than at any previous point during the pandemic. “We’re in truly crushed mode,” said Dr. Gabe Kelen, director of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s emergency department. The number of I.C.U. patients is a lagging indicator, likely to rise in the coming weeks, experts said. What’s more, some states are still struggling under the crush of hospitalizations from Delta, a previous version of the virus that may be more virulent. (Hospitals are frequently in the dark about which variant newly admitted patients are infected with.) NEW DELHI — When the Omicron coronavirus variant spread through India late in December, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged the nation to be vigilant and follow medical guidelines. Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of the capital region of Delhi, swiftly introduced night curfews, shut down movie theaters, and slashed restaurants and public transport to half capacity. Then, both men hit the campaign trail, often appearing without masks in packed rallies of thousands. “When it is our bread and butter at stake, they force restrictions and lockdowns,” said Ajay Tiwari, a 41-year-old taxi driver in New Delhi. “There are much bigger crowds at political rallies, but they don’t impose any lockdown in those areas. It really pains us deep in the heart.” As Omicron fuels a rapid spread of new infections through India’s major urban hubs, the country’s pandemic fatigue has been intensified by a sense of déjà vu and the frustration of mixed signals. It has been just a few months since the deadly Delta variant ravaged the country, when government leaders vastly underestimated its threat and publicly flouted their own advice. The memories of overwhelmed hospitals and funeral pyres working around the clock are still all too fresh here. The metropolis of Mumbai on Wednesday reported more than 15,000 new infections in 24 hours — the highest daily caseload since the pandemic began, beating the city’s previous record of about 11,000 cases during the second wave in the spring. In New Delhi, the number of daily infections increased by nearly 100 percent overnight. The sheer size of India’s population, at 1.4 billion, has always kept experts wary about the prospects of a new coronavirus variant. In few places around world was the toll of Delta as stark as in India. The country’s official figures show about half a million pandemic deaths — a number that experts say vastly undercounts the real toll. WASHINGTON — President Biden came into office vowing to restore public trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after the Trump White House had tied the agency’s hands and manipulated its scientific judgments on the pandemic for political ends. Yet in his first year, Mr. Biden has presided over a series of messaging failures that have followed a familiar pattern, with the agency’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, and her team making what experts say are largely sound decisions, but fumbling in communicating them to America. Dr. Walensky, a highly regarded infectious disease expert from Boston with no prior government experience, insisted in February that schools must keep students six feet apart; in March, she said three feet was enough. She said in February that teachers did not need to be vaccinated to reopen schools; the White House said the next day that she was speaking “in her personal capacity.” In May, she said that vaccinated people generally did not need to wear masks in public, a sudden change that flummoxed state health officials. Two months later, she reversed that guidance after it was shown that vaccinated people could still transmit the coronavirus. More recently, with the Omicron variant driving a near vertical rise in cases, Dr. Walensky alerted the White House that she planned to recommend that people infected with the virus isolate for five days instead of 10. To avoid another messaging fiasco, she briefed other top Biden health officials on her proposal so they would all be on the same page, according to two people familiar with her actions. But both Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, and Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, the surgeon general, took issue on national television with the agency’s policy of not requiring a negative Covid test before ending the shorter isolation. Dr. Tom Frieden, the agency’s director under President Barack Obama, said he did not believe the latest recommendations on isolation were significantly wrong, but “the way they were released was very problematic.” The crux of the problem, several administration officials said, is a failure by the C.D.C. and the Biden administration’s messaging experts to work in concert. Dr. Walensky’s critics say she is not collaborative enough, too often springing decisions on other federal officials who then struggle to defend them in public. Her defenders say that she strives to coordinate, but that it is not her job to ensure consensus across the entire administration. Some suggest the White House has gone too far in its hands-off, let-the-scientists-rule approach, leaving a vacuum of leadership and forcing ad hoc coordination between the various public health agencies. On the day President Biden was inaugurated, the advisory board of health experts who counseled him during his transition officially ceased to exist. But its members have quietly continued to meet regularly over Zoom, their conversations often turning to frustration with Mr. Biden’s coronavirus response. Now, six of these former advisers have gone public with an extraordinary, albeit polite, critique — and a plea to be heard. In three opinion articles published on Thursday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, they called for Mr. Biden to adopt an entirely new domestic pandemic strategy geared to the “new normal” of living with the virus indefinitely, not to wiping it out. The authors are all big names in American medicine. Several, including Dr. Luciana Borio, a former acting chief scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, and Dr. David Michaels, a former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration now with George Washington University’s School of Public Health, have held high-ranking government positions. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist, medical ethicist and University of Pennsylvania professor who advised former President Barack Obama, organized the effort. Like any White House, Mr. Biden’s prizes loyalty and prefers to keep its differences in house; in that regard, the articles are an unusual step. The authors say they wrote them partly because they have not made headway talking directly to White House officials. “From a macroperspective, it feels like we are always fighting yesterday’s crisis and not necessarily thinking what needs to be done today to prepare us for what comes next,” Dr. Borio said. The authors shared the articles with White House officials before they were published, but it was unclear whether the administration would adopt any of their suggestions. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, Mr. Biden’s top medical adviser for the pandemic, declined to comment on the articles. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters she had not read the articles, and dismissed a question about whether the president “is coming around to accepting” that Covid-19 is here to stay, even though several recent media accounts suggested that the administration was beginning to operate under that assumption. Mr. Biden’s recent emphasis on keeping schools open and businesses running even when cases are soaring also suggests a recalibration, as does a recent decision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend that people with Covid isolate for five days instead of 10."

The sentence handed down by Judge Cynthia A. Bashant of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California exceeded the recommendations of federal prosecutors and the rabbi’s lawyers, both of whom had recommended home confinement. The rabbi, Yisroel Goldstein, 60, the former director of the Chabad of Poway, was also ordered to pay $2,834,608 in restitution for the schemes, which involved phony contributions to the Chabad and affiliated charities and through which he personally received more than $500,000, prosecutors said. “You dragged down so many congregants,” Judge Bashant said in imposing the sentence, according to a statement from the Justice Department. “I think time in custody is important,” she said. “It’s important to send a message to the community, and it’s important to send a message to you.” Rabbi Goldstein’s lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. In court papers recommending that he be sentenced to four months of home detention, they said that he had accepted responsibility for his actions by laying out the details of his schemes in a guilty plea and had cooperated with the authorities. “I have let myself down and everything I have been taught, and everything that I have preached for 40 years, and allowed myself to be seduced to a very dark place, allowing the power of money to get the better part of my soul,” Rabbi Goldstein wrote in a letter to the judge. He asked the judge to “accept my repentance for the damages and severe disappointment that I have caused.” “I often wonder why I survived the shooting,” he wrote. “The universe must have faith in a better future for me, to become a better person and to make whole for my past sins and transgressions.” Rabbi Goldstein had emerged as a prominent voice of resilience and determination after a gunman who was yelling antisemitic slurs attacked the Chabad of Poway, in Poway, Calif., killing a woman and injuring three other people on April 27, 2019, during the Jewish holiday of Passover. Rabbi Goldstein, who was already under investigation in connection with the fraud schemes at the time of the attack, was shot in both hands and lost an index finger. In the days after, he condemned antisemitism at the United Nations and spoke at a National Day of Prayer event at the White House with President Donald J. Trump. “I guarantee you, we will not be intimidated or deterred by terror,” he said after the shooting. “Terror will not win.” In September, the man who carried out the attack, John T. Earnest of San Diego, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in a deal that spared him the death penalty. Mr. Earnest, who had expressed a desire to kill Jews and Muslims, had also pleaded guilty to setting fire to a mosque. Rabbi Goldstein established the Chabad of Poway in 1986 and had served as its director and head rabbi until 2018, prosecutors said. He began cooperating with the authorities shortly after federal agents executed search warrants at his home in October 2018, and he worked undercover for the government, his lawyers said in court papers. In July 2020, Rabbi Goldstein and five associates pleaded guilty to their roles in the schemes, which was intended to defraud the Internal Revenue Service, several Fortune 500 companies, and several public and private agencies. Prosecutors said that in his plea agreement, Rabbi Goldstein had acknowledged that, while he was director of the synagogue, he had received at least $6.2 million in phony contributions to the Chabad and affiliated charities and had secretly refunded up to 90 percent of the donations to the bogus donors. After he provided the donors with fake receipts, they claimed illegal tax deductions, and Rabbi Goldstein kept about 10 percent for himself, prosecutors said. Rabbi Goldstein acknowledged that he had also defrauded three companies by “tricking them into matching supposed charitable donations of their employees,” prosecutors said in a statement. In court papers, prosecutors recommended that Rabbi Goldstein be sentenced to eight months of home detention. They said the attack on the synagogue was “a driving factor behind the extraordinary departure and sentencing recommendation of the United States.” “Following the shooting, Rabbi Goldstein repeatedly spoke out about the attack, and was the face of the community both locally and nationally, despite his injury and PTSD,” prosecutors wrote in court papers. In a statement on Tuesday, Randy Grossman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California, said that the sentence handed down by Judge Bashant “accounts for these extraordinary circumstances and our office’s mission to always seek justice.” “Yisroel Goldstein exploited his position and stature as a faith leader to commit well-planned and carefully executed crimes of greed,” Mr. Grossman said."

Read more in a note from Times Opinion’s politics editor Ezekiel Kweku in our Opinion Today newsletter. One year ago, a violent mob, guided by unscrupulous politicians, stormed the Capitol and almost succeeded in preventing the democratic transfer of power. All four of us former presidents condemned their actions and affirmed the legitimacy of the 2020 election. There followed a brief hope that the insurrection would shock the nation into addressing the toxic polarization that threatens our democracy. However, one year on, promoters of the lie that the election was stolen have taken over one political party and stoked distrust in our electoral systems. These forces exert power and influence through relentless disinformation, which continues to turn Americans against Americans. According to the Survey Center on American Life, 36 percent of Americans — almost 100 million adults across the political spectrum — agree that “the traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.” The Washington Post recently reported that roughly 40 percent of Republicans believe that violent action against the government is sometimes justified. Politicians in my home state of Georgia, as well as in others, such as Texas and Florida, have leveraged the distrust they have created to enact laws that empower partisan legislatures to intervene in election processes. They seek to win by any means, and many Americans are being persuaded to think and act likewise, threatening to collapse the foundations of our security and democracy with breathtaking speed. I now fear that what we have fought so hard to achieve globally — the right to free, fair elections, unhindered by strongman politicians who seek nothing more than to grow their own power — has become dangerously fragile at home. I personally encountered this threat in my own backyard in 1962, when a ballot-stuffing county boss tried to steal my election to the Georgia State Senate. This was in the primary, and I challenged the fraud in court. Ultimately, a judge invalidated the results, and I won the general election. Afterward, the protection and advancement of democracy became a priority for me. As president, a major goal was to institute majority rule in southern Africa and elsewhere. After I left the White House and founded the Carter Center, we worked to promote free, fair and orderly elections across the globe. I led dozens of election observation missions in Africa, Latin America and Asia, starting with Panama in 1989, where I put a simple question to administrators: “Are you honest officials or thieves?” At each election, my wife, Rosalynn, and I were moved by the courage and commitment of thousands of citizens walking miles and waiting in line from dusk to dawn to cast their first ballots in free elections, renewing hope for themselves and their nations and taking their first steps to self-governance. But I have also seen how new democratic systems — and sometimes even established ones — can fall to military juntas or power-hungry despots. Sudan and Myanmar are two recent examples. For American democracy to endure, we must demand that our leaders and candidates uphold the ideals of freedom and adhere to high standards of conduct. First, while citizens can disagree on policies, people of all political stripes must agree on fundamental constitutional principles and norms of fairness, civility and respect for the rule of law. Citizens should be able to participate easily in transparent, safe and secure electoral processes. Claims of election irregularities should be submitted in good faith for adjudication by the courts, with all participants agreeing to accept the findings. And the election process should be conducted peacefully, free of intimidation and violence. Second, we must push for reforms that ensure the security and accessibility of our elections and ensure public confidence in the accuracy of results. Phony claims of illegal voting and pointless multiple audits only detract from democratic ideals. Third, we must resist the polarization that is reshaping our identities around politics. We must focus on a few core truths: that we are all human, we are all Americans and we have common hopes for our communities and our country to thrive. We must find ways to re-engage across the divide, respectfully and constructively, by holding civil conversations with family, friends and co-workers and standing up collectively to the forces dividing us. Fourth, violence has no place in our politics, and we must act urgently to pass or strengthen laws to reverse the trends of character assassination, intimidation and the presence of armed militias at events. We must protect our election officials — who are trusted friends and neighbors of many of us — from threats to their safety. Law enforcement must have the power to address these issues and engage in a national effort to come to terms with the past and present of racial injustice. Lastly, the spread of disinformation, especially on social media, must be addressed. We must reform these platforms and get in the habit of seeking out accurate information. Corporate America and religious communities should encourage respect for democratic norms, participation in elections and efforts to counter disinformation. Our great nation now teeters on the brink of a widening abyss. Without immediate action, we are at genuine risk of civil conflict and losing our precious democracy. Americans must set aside differences and work together before it is too late."

Read more in a note from Times Opinion’s politics editor, Ezekiel Kweku, in our Opinion Today newsletter. When called upon to believe that Barack Obama was really born in Kenya, millions got in line. When encouraged to believe that the 2012 Sandy Hook murder of 20 children and six adults was a hoax, too many stepped up. When urged to believe that Hillary Clinton was trafficking children in the basement of a Washington, D.C., pizza parlor with no basement, they bought it, and one of them showed up in the pizza place with a rifle to protect the kids. The fictions fed the frenzies, and the frenzies shaped the crises of 2020 and 2021. The delusions are legion: Secret Democratic cabals of child abusers, millions of undocumented voters, falsehoods about the Covid-19 pandemic and the vaccine. While much has been said about the moral and political stance of people who support right-wing conspiracy theories, their gullibility is itself alarming. Gullibility means malleability and manipulability. We don’t know if the people who believed the prevailing 2012 conspiracy theories believed the 2016 or 2020 versions, but we do know that a swath of the conservative population is available for the next delusion and the one after that. And on Jan. 6, 2021, we saw that a lot of them were willing to act on those beliefs. The adjective “gullible” comes from the verb “to gull,” which used to mean to cram yourself with something, as well as to cheat or dupe, to cram someone else full of fictions. “Not doubting I could gull the government,” wrote Daniel Defoe in 1701, and Hannah Arendt used the word “gullible” repeatedly in “The Origins of Totalitarianism,” published in 1951. “A mixture of gullibility and cynicism is prevalent in all ranks of totalitarian movements, and the higher the rank the more cynicism weighs down gullibility,” she wrote. That is, among those gulling the public, cynicism is a stronger force; among those being gulled, gullibility is, but the two are not so separate as they might seem. Distinctions between believable and unbelievable, true and false are not relevant for people who have found that taking up outrageous and disprovable ideas is instead an admission ticket to a community or an identity. Without the yoke of truthfulness around their necks, they can choose beliefs that flatter their worldview or justify their aggression. I sometimes think of this straying into fiction as a kind of libertarianism run amok — we used to say, “You’re entitled to your own opinions but not your own facts.” Too many Americans now feel entitled to their own facts. In this too-free marketplace of ideas, they can select or reject ideas, facts or histories to match their goals, because meaning has become transactional. But gullibility means you believe something because someone else wants you to. You’re buying what they’re selling. It’s often said that the joiners of cults and subscribers to delusions are driven by their hatred of elites. But in the present situation, the snake oil salesmen are not just Alex Jones, QAnon’s master manipulators and evangelical hucksters. They are senators, powerful white Christian men, prominent media figures, billionaires and their foundations, even a former president. (Maybe the belief that these figures are not an elite is itself a noteworthy delusion.) It’s true that these leading lights of the right often portray themselves as embattled outsiders. But they’re not; they’re the status quo gone rogue. They are still powerful, still insiders, but something even more potent is changing — you could call it the zeitgeist or the arc of justice or historical momentum or just demographic reality. The world is moving on; those who’d rather it stand still are eager to push narratives depicting these shifts as degeneration and white Christian heterosexual America as profoundly imperiled. A lot of conspiracy theories are organic or at least emerge from true believers on the margins when it comes to topics like extraterrestrials, but those at the top of conservative America have preached falsehoods that further the interest of elites, and those at the bottom have embraced them devoutly. Though when we talk about cults and conspiracies we usually look to more outlandish beliefs, climate denial and gun obsessions fit this template. Both originated as industry agendas that were then embraced by right-wing politicians and the right-leaning public. For decades, the fossil fuel industry pumped out ads and reports and supported lobbyists and front groups misleading the public on the science and import of climate change. The current gun cult is likewise the result of the National Rifle Association and the gun industry pushing battlefield-style weapons and a new white male identity — more paramilitary than rural hunter — along with fear, rage and racist dog whistles. I think of it as a cult, because guns serve first as totems of identity and belonging and because the beliefs seem counterfactual about guns as sources of safety rather than danger, when roughly 60 percent of gun deaths are suicides and self-defense by gun is a surpassingly rare phenomenon. Right-wing political fictions have a long history, from Joe McCarthy’s bluffs about communists in the government to the United Nations’ black helicopters of 1990s paranoia to an endless stream of stories portraying immigrants, Jews, Muslims, gay men then and trans people now as sinister threats. The digital age and then the Covid pandemic caused many of us to withdraw further from contact with people unlike ourselves, and pundits and social media offered those “others” back as phantasms and gargoyles leering at us through the filters. We all have confirmation biases, and of course leftists and moderates have also entertained delusions and paranoia — about extraterrestrials, vaccines and political assassinations, for instance. But mainstream figures in the center and on the left are not pushing radically counterfactual stuff akin to the conservative lies about Covid-19, let alone trying to instigate or whitewash the kind of violence we saw on Jan. 6. Democrats operate on the basis of reasonably factual premises and usually accept the authority of science, law and history, while Republicans uninhibitedly push whatever’s most convenient for their goals and incendiary for their base. Of course, some of these stories are proxies for existing beliefs. Birtherism was a roundabout way of saying a Black man could not possibly be a legitimate president; the ruckus about critical race theory is wrong about its actually being taught in schools but right in that how we think and talk and teach about race has shifted from when whiteness was unquestionably supreme. Issues from climate to Covid are anathema to the right because solving them would require large-scale cooperation, in conflict with the idea that individual rights should be paramount. That may be why conservatives framed all Covid precautionary measures as violations of individual freedom. Dying for your beliefs has taken on grim new meaning: Since vaccines became widely available, counties that voted heavily for Donald Trump have had nearly three times the Covid-19 death rate as counties that voted for Joe Biden. Quite a lot of these stories, about everything from elections to epidemiology, are as dangerous as they are false. Beyond the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6 are numerous incidents of true believers in Mr. Trump’s big lie threatening and assaulting election workers. In one case in Houston in October, a former police captain, who had been hired by a wealthy Trump supporter, allegedly ran a repairman off the road and held him at gunpoint, claiming falsely that he had as many as 750,000 fake ballots in his vehicle. Reuters reported in June, “Election officials and their families are living with threats of hanging, firing squads, torture and bomb blasts.” It’s as though Mr. Trump’s supporters believe they can bully truth itself into submission. Democracy is premised on the belief that we can trust ordinary people to make consequential decisions. It’s in some ways an Enlightenment ideal premised on another Enlightenment ideal: the triumph of reason and the capacities of ordinary people. To buy into it, you have to believe that people will be more loyal to principles and discernment than to leaders and groups, and in that sense, democracy has always been a risky project. If democracy requires independent-minded people who can reason well, autocracy requires the opposite: people who will obey orders about what to think as well as do. While Republicans assault voting rights and the integrity of our elections, what fuels their advances is the rise of a gullible sector of the public ready to follow their leaders wherever they go. What’s often described as a weakness of the Democratic Party — the existence of a variety of views and positions, freely debated or even fought over, and a restless, questioning electorate — is a strength of democracy. The Republicans remain committed to punishing and casting out dissenters — such as Representative Liz Cheney, who has been ostracized since she recognized the criminality of Jan. 6 — only further inhibiting open debate and, these days, inconvenient facts. Authoritarians don’t just want to control the government, the economy and the military. They want to control the truth. Truth has its own authority, an authority a strongman must defeat, at least in the minds of his followers, persuading them to abandon fact, the standards of verification, critical thinking and all the rest. Such people become a standing army awaiting their next command."

Trump did so with the same conviction — that a president of their party deserved to be charged with inciting insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021 — and the same hope — that his role in doing so would finally persuade the G.O.P. to repudiate him. But in the year since the deadliest attack on the Capitol in centuries, none of the 10 lawmakers have been able to avoid the consequences of a fundamental miscalculation about the direction of their party. The former president is very much the leader of the Republicans, and it is those who stood against him whom the party has thrust into the role of pariah. Since they cast their impeachment votes on Jan. 13, Representatives Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois have announced their retirements amid death threats from voters and hostility from colleagues. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming has gone from a star in the House Republican leadership to an exiled party gadfly and truth teller. Representatives Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington, Peter Meijer of Michigan and Fred Upton of Michigan have Trump-endorsed primary challengers on their heels and uncertain political futures. Four others — John Katko of New York, Dan Newhouse of Washington, Tom Rice of South Carolina and David Valadao of California — have gone to ground, silent if not silenced, in the apparent hope that the entire episode will be forgotten. The fate of the 10 over the past year has offered a bracing reality check about the nature of today’s Republican Party, one that has fully embraced the lie of a stolen election and its main purveyor, and sidelined the few remaining members who have dared to publicly question Mr. Trump or his actions. “There’s been this waiting game and an arbitrage between an individual’s political future and the trajectory of that guy, assuming the apex has passed,” Mr. Meijer said in a lengthy interview, referring to Mr. Trump. “The view among some was that this would be essentially a self-correcting issue,” and that Mr. Trump’s power would fade. “I think that’s proven overly optimistic,” Mr. Meijer added. The 10 could be forgiven for believing that their votes last January would not leave them so exposed. In the immediate aftermath of the Capitol riot, some of Mr. Trump’s most stalwart allies quit the government in disgust. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader, voted against impeachment but declared, “The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters.” The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, orchestrated Mr. Trump’s acquittal after a hasty Senate impeachment trial. But he had let it be known that he considered the president culpable, and said as much in a scathing speech afterward: “There’s no question — none — that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.” But the rhetorical cover fire proved as ephemeral as it was useless. Mr. Gonzalez, deluged with threats and fearing for the safety of his wife and children, announced in September that he would not seek re-election — and called Mr. Trump “a cancer for the country.” A Cuban American who starred as a wide receiver at Ohio State, Mr. Gonzalez had been considered the kind of politician who would ensure the Republican Party’s future in a multiethnic, multiracial country after his election in 2018. But he found little support from the party that recruited him into politics once Mr. Trump endorsed a primary challenger and the threats began. Mr. Kinzinger, who announced his retirement in October, has faced similar threats. But he has turned his opposition to Mr. Trump into a capstone of his career, defying Republican leaders to join the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack, laying into Mr. Trump and his defenders at every opportunity, and promising not to leave the political stage once his House career ends this year. “The 2020 election was not stolen,” Mr. Kinzinger said in a lengthy video message on Wednesday for the anniversary of Jan. 6. “Joe Biden won, and Donald Trump lost. We have to admit it. But the leadership of the Republican Party won’t. They lied to the American people and continue to push the big lie and echo the conspiracy theories that line their pockets, keeping them in power.” Mr. Upton has never been one for flash, yet his future is no more secure, despite 35 years in the House. He could face Steve Carra, a state representative endorsed by Mr. Trump, who would have to move homes to mount a primary challenge against Mr. Upton because of new congressional maps drafted by a bipartisan commission. “I’m 100 percent running for Congress, it’s an honor to have President Trump’s endorsement, and Fred Upton will not be a congressman in 2023,” Mr. Carra said in a text message. Even if Mr. Upton does not have to face Mr. Carra, his impeachment vote has placed him at risk. The new map pushed Mr. Upton into the same district as Bill Huizenga, a more conservative congressman who voted against impeachment. Under the circumstances, Mr. Upton is showing clear signs of fatigue. “You’ve got metal detectors now going on the House floor. We get really nasty threats at home. The tone gets, you know, tougher and tougher, and it’s a pretty toxic place,” he said last month on CNN. “I’ve never seen anything like this before.” None of the 10 have fallen so far in the Republican firmament as Ms. Cheney, nor risen so high in the esteem of many in both parties who fear and loathe Mr. Trump. The daughter of a former vice president who was once the embodiment of confrontational conservatism, for better or worse, Ms. Cheney started 2021 as the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, a political knife fighter believed by many to be destined for the speakership. Her vote to impeach, and her outspoken denunciations of the lie — pushed by Mr. Trump and embraced by many of her colleagues — that the 2020 election was “stolen,” cost her dearly. She was ousted from her leadership post, ejected from the Wyoming Republican Party and targeted repeatedly by the former president, who has tried to unite Wyoming voters around the primary opponent he has endorsed, Harriet Hageman. Ms. Cheney has soldiered on, becoming the vice chairwoman of the House select committee investigating the riot, the face of Republican resistance to Trumpism and a one-woman wrecking crew for Mr. McCarthy’s ambitions to become speaker next year if the party retakes control of the House. Looking back, Ms. Cheney said in an interview that her fall from Republican leadership was inevitable as long as she had to share the stage with Mr. McCarthy, whose brief denunciation of Mr. Trump after Jan. 6 quickly gave way to a resumption of fealty. “It was increasingly clear that staying as conference chair was going to require me to perpetuate the lie about the election,” Ms. Cheney said. “I was simply not willing to look the other way and accept what he did.” Mr. McCarthy, by contrast, visited Mr. Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla, near the end of January, making it “pretty clear the path that he had chosen,” Ms. Cheney added. “It was one that was not faithful to the Constitution.” Never one to let bygones be bygones, Mr. Trump has relentlessly pursued retribution against those who voted to impeach him. In September, he endorsed a square-jawed, Army Special Forces veteran, Joe Kent, to challenge Ms. Herrera Beutler, who before her vote had revealed one of the most damning vignettes of Jan. 6 for Mr. Trump. She recounted a phone call in which Mr. McCarthy had personally pleaded with the president to call off the rioters during the assault. Mr. Trump had responded, “Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.” Mr. Kent has heartily embraced the lie that Mr. Trump won the 2020 election and has said that the former president bears no responsibility for the attack. Ms. Hageman, the candidate whom Mr. Trump endorsed to unseat Ms. Cheney, is more of a political insider: She was part of the Republican resistance to his ascent in 2016. But she has since embraced him, calling Mr. Trump the greatest president of her lifetime and claiming that there are “legitimate questions” about the outcome of the 2020 election. John Gibbs, Mr. Trump’s choice to unseat Mr. Meijer, was the former president’s pick to lead the Office of Personnel Management. But his nomination stalled after CNN uncovered tweets that he posted promoting the conspiracy theory that John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign chairman, took part in a satanic ritual and defending the antisemitic Twitter account of the alt-right figure Ricky Vaughn. Despite the threat, Mr. Meijer — a political neophyte who cast what may prove to be the most consequential vote of his career days after he was sworn in — says he has no regrets about his vote to impeach. He has spoken frankly about the sinister forces in his party that gave rise to the Capitol riot. “Based on demonstrated public behavior, of course Jan. 6 was a step toward authoritarianism,” Mr. Meijer said. But he has tempered such statements with criticism of Democrats, saying, “authoritarian populism is alive and well in both parties.” “The system is not providing the recourse that we need,” Mr. Meijer said, tying together Jan. 6 and racial justice protests in 2020 that sometimes turned violent. “That’s the through line between the riots of last summer, Jan. 6 and now. The system itself has been delegitimized.” Ms. Cheney, by contrast, laid the responsibility with Republicans alone. “Our party has to choose,” she said. “We can either be loyal to Donald Trump, or we can be loyal to the Constitution, but we cannot be both. And right now, there are far too many Republicans who are trying to enable the former president, embrace the former president, look the other way and hope that the former president goes away.” For now, he is very much present. Senate Republicans had an opportunity to banish Mr. Trump permanently from politics; if 17 of them had joined Democrats in voting to convict him at this impeachment trial, it would have yielded the two-thirds majority needed to remove him and paved the way for a separate vote to bar him from office. But only seven Republicans voted to convict. One of them, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, lamented that in her party’s haste to “get this behind us,” Republicans lost the opportunity to do just that.  Like so many of her House Republican counterparts, Ms. Murkowski is facing a primary challenge this year from a Trump-endorsed candidate. “I am ever the optimist when it comes to the greatness of our country, and I want to continue to have that level of optimism, that when we get too close to the brink, we have the ability to pull ourselves back,” she said. “That’s one of the reasons that I’m signing up to run again — because I feel it’s important to be one of those voices that hopefully can pull us back.”"
36,The New York Times,nytimes,Ten House Republicans voted to impeach Donald Trump with inciting the Capitol attack. All of them are still struggling with the consequences.

The prosecutors’ request, in a letter filed with the court, raised the possibility of additional inquiry into how jurors who voted to convict Ms. Maxwell had been selected and the prospect of Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers moving to have a mistrial declared in the closely watched case. Later on Wednesday, Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers indicated they planned to do just that, saying in two letters to the judge that their client would seek a new trial and that the judge “can and should order” one without holding a hearing, as the government had requested. Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers said Ms. Maxwell planned to make her request under a federal rule that grants a judge the power to grant a new trial when the “interest of justice so requires.” The dueling requests, and the disclosure that prompted them, threatened to cloud the conviction of Ms. Maxwell, who was found guilty last month of five counts related to what prosecutors said was her role in procuring teenage girls for the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse.  In another potential complication, a second juror described in an interview with The New York Times having been sexually abused as a child. This juror, who requested anonymity, said that they, too, had discussed the experience during deliberations and that the revelation had appeared to help shape the jury’s discussions.  The two jurors’ disclosures could be particularly problematic if they failed to note their experiences to the court during jury selection. All the potential jurors in the case were asked in a confidential questionnaire whether they or any relatives or friends had been the victim of sexual abuse or harassment. The juror who was interviewed by the other news outlets, including The Independent and Reuters, could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday. Lawyers for Ms. Maxwell did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment. In their letter, federal prosecutors asked the judge in the case, Alison J. Nathan, to schedule a hearing on the matter in about a month, adding that “any juror investigation should be conducted exclusively under the supervision of the court.” Early Wednesday evening, Judge Nathan set a schedule for motions on Ms. Maxwell’s bid for a new trial, giving the defense until Jan. 19 to file a motion and setting Feb. 2 as the government’s deadline for responding.  “The parties’ briefing should address whether an inquiry of some kind is permitted and/or required, and if so, the nature of such an inquiry,” the judge wrote. She also granted the government’s request to offer court-appointed legal counsel to the juror whose statements prompted the flurry of post-trial activity.  One immediate question in an inquiry would most likely be how the two jurors responded to the questionnaires, sent to hundreds of prospective jurors in the weeks before the trial, in Federal District Court in Manhattan.  The form included questions on a range of topics, including whether prospective jurors or members of their families had experienced sexual abuse. The prospective jurors’ responses remain under seal. The juror who was interviewed by the other news outlets told Reuters he “flew through” the initial questionnaire and did not recall being asked about his personal experiences with sexual abuse. He said he would have answered such questions honestly, Reuters reported. He and the second juror both made it to the next round of jury selection, appearing in court in November. There, in a process known as voir dire, Judge Nathan, drawing on their questionnaire answers, asked them several follow-up questions. Neither was asked in that setting whether they had been sexually abused, nor did they say that they had been. Judge Nathan’s questioning of several prospective jurors, including some who wound up on the panel, indicated that they had answered “yes” to a question about whether they or a loved one had ever been the victim of a crime.  Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers said in one of their letters to Judge Nathan on Wednesday that if she decided to hold a hearing in the matter, it should be happen in less than a month. They also suggested that all 12 jurors who took part in the deliberations and verdict be questioned.  At trial, prosecutors presented two dozen witnesses and other evidence showing that Ms. Maxwell, 60, the daughter of a British media mogul, helped Mr. Epstein recruit, groom and sexually abuse underage girls. He was found dead in a Manhattan jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges; the medical examiner ruled that Mr. Epstein had hanged himself.  The jury acquitted Ms. Maxwell of one count of enticing a minor to travel across state lines to engage in an illegal sexual act. A sentencing date has not been set.  Former federal prosecutors and legal experts said on Wednesday that the jurors’ disclosures could undermine the verdict, especially if it is shown that they did not answer the jury questionnaires or voir dire honestly. Arlo Devlin-Brown, a former federal prosecutor who once ran the Southern District’s public-corruption unit, said, “Generally there is nothing wrong with jurors bringing their personal experiences into deliberations,” so long as they follow the judge’s instructions.  “However,” he added, “dishonesty during the selection process goes to the very integrity of the proceedings and credible allegations of such are taken very seriously.”"

So many of us have come to believe that if our children spend more than a certain amount of time staring at a screen, whether television, phone or iPad, they will succumb to some capitalist plot to turn them all into little consumption monsters with insatiable appetites for toys, sugar, more screen time. This seems absurd to me, but as the father of a 4-year-old, I have not been immune to screen-time shaming — it upsets me to see my child watching a vapid show like “Paw Patrol” on our iPad. These moments of protest usually come, it should be noted, when I’m sitting beside her, staring at my own phone, scrolling through Twitter. “This show is dumb,” I’ll sometimes say. She almost always ignores me. Her stony silence then prompts me to try to think of a show that’s not dumb, which is an impossible task — because what kids’ programming isn’t dumb? For the last two years, her favorite show has been “Octonauts,” about a diverse band of animals who explore the oceans and swamplands in vessels called GUPs. They help whales and eels and flamingos in need. What’s left unsaid, but certainly seems clear enough to me, is that the Octonauts have colonized the Vegimals, a species of squeaking underwater creatures who all resemble one sort of vegetable or another. The Vegimals’ oppression does not register with my daughter, who has watched every “Octonauts” episode multiple times, owns a small fortune in toy GUPs and goes to her preschool dressed in a sweater with Kwaazi, an incorrigible pirate cat, knit across the front. I have not yet talked to her about how the Vegimals are portrayed as infantile, loyal beings who love to bake kelp cakes all day, but I plan on doing so soon. What effect do all these television shows have on the developing brain of a 4-year-old? I don’t honestly know, but I try not to worry too much about it. Life is long and full of different stimuli. I spent most of my preteen years reading horny fantasy books by Piers Anthony and the science fiction of L. Ron Hubbard. The “good” books I read mostly involved warrior mice who were probably also colonialists. I’m fine now. A wary ambivalence seems like the most healthful way to go. There is one type of video I refuse to let my daughter watch: toy videos. Parents with kids of a certain age will certainly know what I’m talking about here, but for the rest, a toy video is an internet genre, usually found on YouTube, that features someone playing with another plastic monstrosity, often one with tie-ins to “Paw Patrol.” The genre has spawned many toy-video variants: Some feature adults; others, kids. Some have even been deliberately packaged to hide their true content from concerned, but perhaps less than vigilant, parents. On occasion, especially on long drives, I’ll hand my daughter the iPad. She watches “Peppa Pig,” which I, of course, hate — those British pigs with their phallic noses prattling on about nothing. Invariably, after about 20 minutes or so, I’ll look back and see her, still strapped into her car seat, brow furrowed, jabbing at the screen with her finger. Then I’ll hear the same high-pitched nonsense, but in a much worse British accent, and know she has switched from Peppa proper to a video of some adult with Peppa toys who, for God knows what reason, is re-enacting a scene in which Peppa and her brother, George, go jump in muddy puddles or whatever. “No!” I yell. My daughter then looks up, annoyed. There’s no real logic to this, of course. What’s the difference between watching the Anglophone silliness of Peppa, a show that exists only to sell toys, and a video of someone playing with the toys themselves? Until recently, my daughter and I were somehow able to avoid the king of toy videos: Ryan Kaji. There’s no one way to describe what Kaji, who is now 10 years old, has done across his multiple YouTube channels, cable television shows and live appearances: In one video, he is giving you a tour of the Legoland Hotel; in another, he splashes around in his pool to introduce a science video about tsunamis. But for years, what he has mostly done is play with toys: Thomas the Tank Engine, “Paw Patrol” figures, McDonald’s play kitchens. A new toy and a new video for almost every day of the week, adding up to an avalanche of content that can overwhelm your child’s brain, click after click. Kaji has been playing with toys on camera since Barack Obama was in the White House. Here are a few of the companies that are now paying him handsomely for his services: Amazon, Walmart, Nickelodeon, Skechers. Ryan also has 10 separate YouTube channels, which together make up “Ryan’s World,” a content behemoth whose branded merchandise took in more than $250 million last year. Even conservative estimates suggest that the Kaji family take exceeds $25 million annually. But we’re a full decade into being stunned by YouTuber incomes, and I’m not sure these numbers should be alarming, or even surprising. Ryan’s parents, Shion and Loann Kaji, met while they were undergraduates at Texas Tech University. Shion, the son of a microchip executive, moved to the United States from Japan when he was in high school and still speaks with a slight accent. Loann’s family escaped Vietnam on a boat and shuttled through refugee camps in Malaysia and Singapore before they made it to the United States; she grew up in Houston wanting to be a teacher. After college, Shion left to get his master’s in engineering at Cornell, but he returned to Texas within a year, after Ryan was born. (He would complete his master’s degree online.) They moved in together and began the uncertain and difficult work of trying to piece a family together. Which is all to say, these aren’t your stereotypical parents of a child star, who, frustrated with their own crashed Hollywood dreams, put their kid through singing and dancing lessons in the living room of a bungalow in Van Nuys. But neither are they just an adorable couple who stumbled into fame and fortune. They’re much cannier than that. In his first-ever video, Ryan Kaji, then just 3, squats on the floor of the toy aisle at Target. He looks very cute, doe-eyed with a Beatles mop cut. He’s being filmed by Loann. “Hi, Ryan,” she says brightly. “Hi, Mommy,” Ryan says. “What you want today?” Loann asks. “What is your pick of the week?” Ryan stands up and picks out a “Lego choo-choo train.” He does seem precocious, but not obnoxious — he doesn’t rattle off factorials or sing “Over the Rainbow” or “Tangled Up in Blue” or anything like that. Just a 3-year-old who seems a little advanced for his age, especially when it comes to expressing himself. There’s little that distinguishes this video from the millions of other family videos on YouTube, and Loann herself says she didn’t really expect anything to come from it other than something to share with her son’s grandparents. If you’re being uncharitable, you might note how “pick of the week” seems to suggest a plan for unending content. Shion saw no issue with it — why would he? — but he worried about the cost of buying toys nonstop for Ryan to play with on YouTube. And so the young couple agreed to allocate $20 a week in production costs, toys included. Loann would film everything on her phone and edit the videos on her laptop. At the time, Ryan was watching a lot of YouTube shows. His favorites were “EvanTubeHD” and “Hulyan and Maya,” each of which served as inspiration. Children’s content on YouTube tends to be derivative in this way. Once a specific toy or activity becomes popular, copycats emerge, knowing that algorithms will pick up and spread their version of “Slime Time” or what have you. A result is a self-referential world where thousands of children do the exact same thing on thousands of separate channels. When Ryan was getting started, one of the most popular and copied trends involved a giant papier-mâché egg filled with toys. Loann says Ryan wanted to do a giant-egg video, but this would have broken the weekly budget. Loann improvised. She had a lot of old toys based on the movie “Cars” lying around, which she stuffed into the requisite papier-mâché egg. In the video, Loann wakes Ryan up from a pretend nap. He seems genuinely surprised and begins smacking away at the egg with an inflatable toy. Then he begins pulling some clearly used toys out of the egg and feigning great surprise. The video currently has over a billion views. The giant egg was Ryan’s breakthrough. His channel’s audience began growing at an explosive rate, which then placed pressure on Loann to keep feeding her son’s new fans. “I was worried,” Shion says. “Every time I looked at other YouTubers, I didn’t see the huge growth that we were seeing over a short period of time.” That growth wasn’t just limited to the United States; Ryan was becoming popular in Asia, as well. “I was concerned about how much we could keep doing this without putting too much pressure on Ryan.” Virality is mostly luck: A teenager does a dance on TikTok, and suddenly every middle- and high-school kid has seen it, and before you know it, the dancer has 100 million followers and 15 separate sponsorship deals. Some critics will divine great importance from the tiniest of details and build a theory about what the kids really want, but there’s usually nothing outside the brutal logic of algorithms and the insatiable appetites of children. When Ryan’s egg video went viral, Loann saw an opportunity to make some extra income, though she didn’t know all that much about monetizing videos. Their first paycheck from YouTube was for about $150. At the time, Shion was still working as a structural engineer, and while he wanted to help Loann, who had a job as a teacher, someone needed to earn a steady salary. But after about a year of continued growth and bigger paychecks from YouTube, Shion and Loann both realized that they needed to commit fully to influencer life or risk squandering Ryan’s rare gift. They wanted the core of their channel, at the time called Ryan’s Toys Review, to remain the same — Ryan playing with the toys he liked, from “Cars” and “Thomas & Friends” — but they needed help. So they hired a couple of editors and started a production company, Sunlight Entertainment. Loann, who was pregnant at the time with twin girls — Emma and Katie, who are now 5 years old and appear frequently in Ryan’s videos — finally quit teaching to become a full-time YouTube mom. Shion held out a little longer, but he, too, eventually left his job to manage his son’s business. “I started to feel like I was the dead weight in the family,” Shion told me. Ryan needed full support from both parents. “So that’s when I realized, OK, we need to kind of step back, and we have to see how we can support Ryan in his branding.” Shion and Loann noticed that a lot of kid YouTube channels were focused more on the brand of the toy than on the brand of the talent. They were, in plainer terms, just adding “Thomas the Train” to their titles and hoping that other kids who wanted to consume every single video about Thomas the Tank Engine would stumble upon their content. Shion thought this was backward. Ryan, not the toys, should be the brand. Shion was proposing an interesting evolution: Given Ryan’s popularity, why couldn’t he create his own brands, his own characters, his own toys? Why help Thomas when you can create your own universe of characters, diversify your content streams, ramp up merchandising and license your content to some of the biggest platforms in the world? “People are watching Ryan, not the toy he’s showing,” Shion says. “So, oftentimes, we create a new original, animated character that’s inspired by Ryan.” Today, Ryan’s World includes the separate channels “Combo Panda,” “Ryan’s World Español” and “Gus the Gummy Gator.” Ryan doesn’t put in extensive appearances in all these videos; sometimes he just gives a short introduction. In one recent video, the action starts with Ryan in his backyard holding a rubber ball. He tosses it halfheartedly in the air, watches it bounce and then says that Peck and Combo — two of the cartoon characters in Ryan’s World — are going to teach viewers about gravity. He’s on camera for all of 35 seconds. Loann and Shion say that cameos like this are their way of limiting the amount of time Ryan needs to be on camera, which is their main concern these days. Still, there’s little doubt that he has spent most of his childhood being captured on video. Many of these appearances are banal; some are of dubious taste, like “Ryan’s First Business-Class Airplane Ride to Japan.” Others are just more videos of a cute kid playing with toys. Right now, as I am typing this, the latest entry in the Ryan’s World feed is an hourlong video in which Ryan is present for a vast majority of the screen time. He gives a few scientific facts about the strength of spiders, plays with some toys and is his usual, charming self, all while wearing a Ryan’s World T-shirt. In 2017, the Kajis established a partnership with Pocket.watch, a licensing company headed by a former executive from the Walt Disney Company. Pocket.watch handles the Ryan’s World franchise, including the deals with Walmart, Amazon and Skechers. But even as the family enterprise was expanding, Shion says, most viewers at that time still wanted to see Ryan play with familiar toys. So, Ryan continued to do — and generate a great deal of revenue from — what he had always done: picking up a popular toy and playing with it on camera. In 2019, Truth in Advertising, a consumer watchdog group, filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, accusing the Kajis of “deceiving millions of young children” by not adequately disclosing their advertisers. (A spokeswoman for the family said that they “strictly follow all platforms’ terms of service and all existing laws and regulations, including advertising-disclosure requirements.”) The brand, which has continued to profit from sponsored content on its YouTube channels, also makes money from its line of Ryan’s World toys, multiple deals with streaming networks and licensing deals. Today, Sunshine Entertainment, the production company Shion and Loann created, has 30 employees. And the Kajis have traded Houston for Hawaii. When I asked Loann why they moved, she said, “Well, I always wanted to live in Hawaii, and now that we can afford it, we thought, Why don’t we just do it?” Last summer, I traveled with my daughter to Simi Valley, Calif., for a taping of the Nickelodeon show “Ryan’s Mystery Playdate,” a half-hour-long, professionally produced recapitulation of many of the motifs from Ryan’s YouTube videos. The night before the shoot, I asked my daughter to watch an old episode of the show on our iPad. She didn’t seem particularly interested at first, but when I moved to turn it off, she slapped my hand away and said she liked Ryan. Which didn’t surprise me — why wouldn’t she like him? But I admit I did feel slightly disappointed. Over the next few days, I had her sample a bit more from the Ryan Kaji media empire: A science lesson in which Ryan and his little twin sisters mix baking soda and vinegar; a game of tag played between Loann and Ryan; and the giant-egg video that started it all. She, of course, liked the egg the best. The Nickelodeon shoot was at a remote studio lot that had been made up to resemble a boulevard, with long stretches of building facades that somehow evoked historic Boston and the Wild West at the same time. Crew members in masks and plastic face shields were standing around the set, waiting for the talent to arrive. The Kajis’ tight schedule and their desire to spend as much time as possible in Hawaii means that Ryan flies to Los Angeles, films a season’s worth of shows, then heads right back home. The conceit of “Ryan’s Mystery Playdate” is relatively simple. Ryan, Shion and Loann play a game. Ryan generally wins. Shion usually loses. Loann wins some and loses some, but she mostly hovers as a positive, encouraging presence. At some point, the mystery play date arrives. Today’s two guests were the Pie Ninja, who throws pies, and Major Mess, a burly military man who loves to make messes. A blast of cheery music sounded, then a round of recorded applause. Ryan emerged from a door wearing a pair of polarized sunglasses. Next came Loann and Shion, dressed in brightly colored jumpsuits, followed by a couple of production assistants who carried water and clipboards. The first contest was a simple memory-based matching game. Whoever missed got a pie in the face from the Pie Ninja. Before shooting started, however, Shion and the director on the set had to negotiate whether Shion would be hit with one or two pies. Shion said he didn’t really have any problem with two pies, which pleased the director. When the filming started, Ryan kept the scene together as Loann and Shion repeatedly forgot their lines. This, Loann would tell me later, is how nearly all these shoots go. Ryan rarely makes mistakes, nor does his positive attitude waver much. He spends a majority of “Mystery Playdate” with an amazed, gape-mouthed look on his face. Watching the Kajis coming together as a family to play these games reminded me of a moment from high school, when I was driving around town with a couple of classmates I didn’t know particularly well. One of them, an exemplary student who did things like run for student council, divulged that she and her parents played board games together once a week. This seemed absolutely insane to me, but I didn’t say anything about it, because you never know if your family’s dysfunction is atypical or if everyone else is just lying about their happy lives. I pictured this classmate seated on the floor of a living room, one much bigger than mine, playing Parcheesi with her bookish parents. This image persisted, and for the next year, I felt a great deal of hostility toward her. Today I play games with my daughter almost every night, but I suppose there’s still part of me that thinks about that happy family and still cannot fathom how such things could ever be possible. Why do children want to watch happy children playing with toys they can’t have? Are they responding to the toys or to the images of a happy family? Are they envisioning a life they already feel may be out of reach? And at what age does aspiration turn into resentment? I imagine my daughter will grow tired of these toy videos when she learns to feel real jealousy, which I suppose is a good reason to hope she just keeps watching them. And yet there’s something a bit unsatisfying about this explanation. Because if it were true that children just want to watch other children doing the things they most want to do, the most popular videos would show kids watching “Paw Patrol” on an iPad. The Kaji empire and its thousands of imitators, oddly enough, have created perhaps the only world in which children do not stare at screens. It’s a nice dream, I admit, but not to the extent of persuading me to allow my daughter to keep watching videos. The limits we set as parents may be arbitrary, but they are all we’ve got. Ryan’s life, despite its fictional presentation as a parade of remarkable discoveries that he shares with his enthusiastic parents, may not be all that different from my daughter’s. During the shoot in Simi Valley, after a long stretch of filming in the intense sun, I overheard a crew member say to him, “If you finish this scene, you can play Minecraft.”"
38,The New York Times,nytimes,Federal prosecutors have asked the judge who oversaw Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial to investigate the process by which one of the jurors was chosen after he revealed that he had discussed his experience as a sexual abuse victim during deliberations.,https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F335vq2a%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1HXWWZl3pGkHaU_bsyK_QLm6ORcuoz688rKbWTdltk8d_mjvrQGphaSaU&h=AT3ANj1kMMRz_kGiLvvW_fOvpgSr1Zm2zpfBd1H3AjklvDyjbD3rqBhqWU1JfSFtQci9NhScG4Ci5qMOfEvHngA-KGNk36sX6LsLDmCH9EbX-TCIRK7DmCtJD1vyIyQXaP2Fz8IqRshINXGBtiOK&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT0_vc32Db_C8jYSuTX4gfmffRi8VYeEF5S76HXlGanBHmaPFAh3KDmNdnRXkgxiLi1Iou4jhCok5wZy5YbmF1hTrm-nx5LIENHDLEEEcZ2qV6W8oxCwDzIv2PsWg7aLLH5LVXGhr1qVxYbtNjl0ILl2umMvczUi5SVgqaHI_5EhQaVx,1d,"As the Omicron variant continues to spread across the country, many more people, including those who have been vaccinated, will test positive for the coronavirus. So what should you do if you’re one of them? We spoke to physicians and infectious disease experts about the steps you should take after a positive test or if you find out you’ve been in close contact with an infected person. Here’s their advice. If you’re in public or around people when you get the bad news, put on a mask immediately. Then isolate yourself as quickly as possible, even if you don’t have symptoms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends isolating for at least five full days, followed by five days of wearing a mask around others, as long as you don’t have a fever and any other symptoms are improving. If you are seriously ill with Covid or have a weakened immune system, the C.D.C. recommends an isolation period of 10 to 20 days. If you have a fever, the agency advises you to stay home until the fever resolves. Read more about the new C.D.C. guidelines. If you are waiting for test results but have symptoms of Covid-19, the C.D.C. now recommends that you isolate anyway, regardless of vaccination status. If you live with roommates or family, try to separate yourself from other people (and animals) as much as possible. “You should take yourself out of society,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco. “Wall yourself up in a cocoon.” Isolating in a home with other people may be difficult, but do the best you can. That means staying in your room, away from other members of the household, even for meals. Someone should deliver food to your bedroom door if possible. If the home has more than one bathroom, designate one just for the infected person. If the infected person is a child or older person who needs assistance, both the caregiver and the infected person should wear a mask when the caregiver enters the room, and open the windows if possible. If others are in the house, always wear a high-quality mask when you leave your room. Everyone should mask up in shared spaces. After using a shared bathroom, disinfect the toilet seat and handle, as well as the faucet handles, soap dispenser, counter and light switch. Close the lid before you flush, and turn on the exhaust fan. Open windows to improve ventilation in shared areas. The people living in your household should take precautions, but they don’t need to panic about getting infected too, especially if they’re vaccinated and boosted. “The household rate of contracting Covid from someone is not 100 percent by a long shot, even with the more transmissible variants,” said Dr. Paul Sax, an infectious disease expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School. While it can help incrementally to continue to wipe down shared spaces, “the most important thing is keeping people from breathing air that is filled with germs,” said Tara Kirk Sell, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. If you have a HEPA air cleaner, place it in or outside your bedroom. If you’ve tested positive and feel well, you can take a walk outdoors and get fresh air. If you’re in a city where you will cross paths with other people, wear a mask and keep your distance. If you tested positive after taking a rapid home test, you may want to take a second home test using a different brand or go to a testing center to confirm the result. False positives aren’t common with home tests, but they can happen. Even so, you should assume the positive result is correct, wear a mask and avoid close contact with other people until you get retested. If your positive test came from a laboratory, a second test isn’t necessary. If you receive a negative test on your rapid home test, don’t use that as your sole basis for decision making. The C.D.C. advises that a negative result on a rapid home test does not rule out a Covid infection. To improve the results from an antigen test, the agency recommends testing twice over a three-day period with at least 24 hours and no more than 48 hours between tests. No. In most cases, you won’t know which variant of coronavirus you’ve caught and your lab test typically won’t tell you. In general, the guidance on isolation, monitoring and treatment does not change based on which variant infected you. Think about where you’ve been and who might have inhaled your germs. Contact your employer and let them know. Most workplaces have protocols in place for contact tracing when an employee tests positive. You also want to alert anyone with whom you’ve spent time, going back at least two days before you got tested or started having symptoms, said Dr. Sax. The C.D.C. defines a close contact as someone who was less than six feet from you for 15 minutes or more. It may feel overwhelming, or even shameful, to tell people about your positive test, said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. “A lot of people think it’s some failure if you get infected,” Dr. Jha said. “This is an incredibly contagious variant. A lot of people are going to get it. That is not a moral failure.” Don’t forget to tell your doctor too, particularly if you have an underlying medical condition, like high blood pressure or diabetes, that puts you at higher risk. If the infected person is a child, call your pediatrician. You also need to call your child’s school, as well as anyone they’ve had close contact with at play dates, parties or other activities. Monitor your symptoms. You can use a pulse oximeter to keep track of your blood oxygen levels. Most healthy people will get an oxygen reading around 95 to 99 percent. You should seek medical advice if the reading drops quickly or the level dips to 93 percent or lower. The devices can be less accurate for people with darker skin, so pay attention to the trend. If your reading drops by four points, it’s worth checking in with a doctor. You should also see a doctor if you take a turn for the worse, have trouble breathing or have any symptom that causes you concern. You can learn more in our story, Why Days 5 to 10 Are So Important When You Have Coronavirus. Ask your doctor if you are eligible for monoclonal antibodies, a treatment that can help your body fight Covid-19 and lower your risk for severe illness, particularly for people in a high-risk group. For monoclonal antibody therapy to be most effective, it needs to be given soon after diagnosis, even if you’re not feeling bad yet. If you don’t have a regular doctor, you can also contact the infectious disease clinic at your hospital and ask about the treatment, said Dr. Celine Gounder, an epidemiologist at N.Y.U. medical school. Only one monoclonal antibody treatment, sotrovimab made by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology, has performed well against Omicron in laboratory experiments. Although the supply of sotrovimab is very limited, the Biden administration is in talks with GlaxoSmithKline about securing more doses to be delivered by early next year. The Food and Drug Administration has authorized two different oral treatments for people who are vulnerable to becoming severely ill because they are older or have medical conditions such as obesity or diabetes. Paxlovid, developed by Pfizer, is authorized for high-risk patients age 12 and older, and is meant to be taken as 30 pills over five days. Another pill treatment from Merck, known as molnupiravir, has been authorized for people 18 and older, and is meant to be taken as 40 pills over five days. To calculate your five-day isolation period, count your first day of symptoms as Day 0. If you never had symptoms but have a confirmed positive test, count Day 0 as the day you tested. You can leave isolation after five days if you don’t have a fever and any symptoms you had are getting better. If your symptoms persist or get worse, if you are immunocompromised or are severely ill with Covid, consult with your health care provider about when to leave isolation, which may last between 10 and 20 days. After isolation, the C.D.C. advises that you keep wearing a mask around others for an additional five days. Don’t remove your mask to eat or drink around other people, don’t travel and don’t spend time around high risk people until the masking period has ended. Although the agency didn’t recommend testing after isolation, the new guidelines say people should take a rapid antigen test after the five day isolation period if they have “access to a test and want to test.” Vaccinated adults who had booster shots and fully vaccinated children don’t need to quarantine after a potential exposure, but they should get tested five days later and wear masks around other people for 10 days.  People who are unvaccinated should quarantine for five days after exposure and then get tested. Wear masks around other people for 10 days. This also applies to people who are eligible for booster shots but have not received them yet. The C.D.C. has said that unvaccinated students who are exposed to the virus do not need to miss school after a potential exposure as long as two tests taken during the next week are negative. Read more about the “test to stay” protocol. Yes. The degree of protection you get from a previous infection varies widely. You’re more protected if you’ve also been vaccinated. Early studies suggest antibodies from a past Covid infection alone are not a strong defense against Omicron. “Unfortunately, reinfection after people have had Covid before, can occur, and the protection of previous infections is very variable and unpredictable,” said Dr. David Rubin, the director of PolicyLab at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. “So some people seem to be very protected and don’t get Covid again, and other people can get it again and even get quite severe disease again.”"
39,The New York Times,nytimes,"Philadelphia authorities said there were 26 people in the two-unit rowhouse that burned early Wednesday. 13 people have been confirmed dead, including seven children. https://nyti.ms/3zCs6YI",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3JJeCyW%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0JDHX9U5w-pGcMniik6BUOYUZyUwd0_r69kJTOSRj2pOKRqhQ43RScdZg&h=AT0wv2s5_WurBBU5BjgiAp_wtj9aRADNYkv3Ajh1IpSIzZkdUCPSOy9GZPajPBoocv29Qvu0GzOLWKe9sj5hgAI_fNcKMv28SD6Gr-ElRbUYK5mbxyF99YdbSFTcIlmylkPC9vaD6I_z-W1zBj7_&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT0CZu3NFc3zMW41d8G_vsWOBBu4Y4TAzmV3UEAw01-gwhIJKRH4nUIu9XFZcgW4JGjKXvAmKTL6zKWJkpKFzNTqxHWJjPmvOei6vGZ6Mmu2XssHqpF7R0pynBK4IoFB1rlUr7UX-ghb1Ysym0pEctiqgXOdEnISlGLl1QrtuASomkWl,1d,"They were perplexing thefts, lacking a clear motive or payoff, and they happened in the genteel, not particularly lucrative world of publishing: Someone was stealing unpublished book manuscripts. The thefts and attempted thefts occurred primarily over email, by a fraudster impersonating publishing professionals and targeting authors, editors, agents and literary scouts who might have drafts of novels and other books. The mystery may now be solved. On Wednesday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Filippo Bernardini, a 29-year-old rights coordinator for Simon & Schuster UK, saying that he “impersonated, defrauded, and attempted to defraud, hundreds of individuals” over five or more years, obtaining hundreds of unpublished manuscripts in the process. Mr. Bernardini, who was arrested after landing at John F. Kennedy International Airport, was charged with wire fraud and aggravated identity theft in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. A spokesman for the Southern District said Mr. Bernardini did not yet have a lawyer. A Simon & Schuster spokesman, in a statement, said the publisher was “shocked and horrified” by the allegations Mr. Bernardini faces and that he has been suspended until there is further information on the case. “The safekeeping of our authors’ intellectual property is of primary importance to Simon & Schuster, and for all in the publishing industry, and we are grateful to the FBI for investigating these incidents and bringing charges against the alleged perpetrator,” he added. Simon & Schuster was not accused of wrongdoing in the indictment. According to the indictment, to get his hands on the manuscripts, Mr. Bernardini would send out emails impersonating real people working in the publishing industry — a specific editor, for example — by using fake email addresses. He would employ slightly tweaked domain names like penguinrandornhouse.com instead of penguinrandomhouse.com, — putting an “rn” in place of an “m.” The indictment said he had registered more than 160 fraudulent internet domains that impersonated publishing professionals and companies. Mr. Bernardini also targeted a New York City-based literary scouting company. He set up impostor login pages that prompted his victims to enter their usernames and passwords, which gave him broad access to the scouting company’s database. Mr. Bernardini left few digital crumbs online, omitting his last name on his social media accounts, like Twitter and LinkedIn, where he described an “obsession for the written word and languages.” According to his LinkedIn profile, he obtained his bachelor’s in Chinese language from Università Cattolica in Milan, and later served as the Italian translator for the Chinese comic book author Rao Pingru’s memoir, “Our Story.” He also obtained a master’s degree in publishing from University College London and described his passion as ensuring “books can be read and enjoyed all over the world and in multiple languages.” Many in publishing who received the phishing emails noted that whoever wrote them was clearly familiar with the industry. The thief would sometimes use common shorthand, like “ms” for manuscript, and understood how a book got from one point to the next on its way to publication. The phishing attacks have been so voluminous and far-reaching, hitting publishing professionals in the United States, Sweden and Taiwan, among other countries, that some have said it could not possibly be the work of just one person. For years, the scheme has baffled people in the book world. Works by high-profile writers and celebrities like Margaret Atwood and Ethan Hawke have been targeted, but so have story collections and works by first-time authors. When manuscripts were successfully stolen, none of them seemed to show up on the black market or the dark web. Ransom demands never materialized. Indeed, the indictment details how Mr. Bernardini went about the scheme, but not why. Early knowledge in a rights department could be an advantage for an employee trying to prove his worth. Publishers compete and bid to publish work abroad, for example, and knowing what’s coming, who is buying what and how much they’re paying could give companies an edge. “What he’s been stealing,” said Kelly Farber, a literary scout, “is basically a huge amount of information that any publisher anywhere would be able to use to their advantage.” In a news release announcing the arrest, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “This real-life storyline now reads as a cautionary tale, with the plot twist of Bernardini facing federal criminal charges for his misdeeds.”"

The current chairman of the alliance, the Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, said in a statement that the troops would be stationed there only “for a limited time period,” until order could be restored. He did not elaborate on how many soldiers could be mobilized or how long they might stay. Russia is notorious for sending in troops under the guise of peacekeeping missions that go on to establish a permanent presence in the host countries. The Kazakh president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, issued the invitation earlier in the evening. Calling the demonstrators “a band of international terrorists,” he said he was turning to Russia’s version of NATO, called the Collective Security Treaty Organization, to “help Kazakhstan overcome this terrorist threat.” The revolt began on Sunday in western Kazakhstan as a protest against a surge in fuel prices. Four days later, with government buildings, TV stations, the airport and numerous businesses stormed by thousands of anti-government protesters, the uprising has expanded into a full-throated attack on an entrenched Kazakh elite widely reviled as autocratic and corrupt. On Thursday, a police spokeswoman said dozens of people had been killed by the authorities when they tried to storm government buildings, police headquarters and district police offices, the first widespread fatalities involving protesters since the demonstrations started. That announcement came after earlier reports in the local news media that the police had opened fire on demonstrators in the oil city of Atyrau, killing at least one person. Footage posted online on Wednesday showed thousands of people storming the main government building in the country’s largest city, Almaty. Smoke billowed from the building that afternoon as the crowd began to disperse. The regional branch of the governing Nur Otan party was also set on fire, local news outlets reported, as was the former presidential residence. News services reported renewed clashes between protesters and the police, who used stun grenades and tear gas to quell the crowd. Protesters also set fire to the prosecutor’s office in Almaty before heading for the president’s residence. The Almaty police said that protesters burned 120 cars, including 33 police vehicles, and damaged about 400 businesses, and that more than 200 had been detained. The country’s Internal Affairs Ministry said that eight members of law enforcement had died in the clashes.   The protests began peacefully Sunday in the oil town of Zhanaozen, after the government doubled the cost of liquefied petroleum gas — used to fuel vehicles in Kazakhstan — to about 100 tenge, or 22 cents, per liter. By the time the government announced on Tuesday that it would rescind the price increase, the protests had spread across the country, with broader demands for increased political representation and improved social benefits. Apparently unsatisfied by an announcement early Wednesday that the entire government would be sacked and that new parliamentary elections were possible, protesters took control of the country’s main airport. The protests reverberated across the continent to Moscow, where President Vladimir V. Putin was forced to witness another uprising against an authoritarian, Kremlin-aligned nation, following pro-democracy protests in Ukraine in 2014 and in Belarus in 2020. The protests represent a warning signal for the Kremlin, said Arkady Dubnov, a Central Asia expert in Moscow, describing the government in Kazakhstan as “a reduced replica of the Russian one.” He added: “There is no doubt that the Kremlin would not want to see an example of such a regime beginning to talk to the opposition and conceding to their demands.” The timing is particularly awkward for Mr. Putin, who hopes to use three meetings next week with Western delegations to renegotiate post-Cold War international security agreements on Ukraine and what Russia considers its sphere of influence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The revolt also seemed to mark a decisive break with the rule of Kazakhstan’s former president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who stepped down as president in 2019 but had still kept a hand in the country’s affairs. Video footage showed protesters toppling a statue of Mr. Nazarbayev in the capital of the Almaty region, Taldykorgan, with people chanted “shal ket,” Kazakh for “Old man, leave!” He has played no role in combating the protests, leaving that to his hand-picked successor, Mr. Tokayev. While initially conciliatory, the government has taken a steadily harder line against the protesters, imposing a strict state of emergency throughout the country. Mr. Tokayev said Wednesday that he would assume all formal levers of power and promised to “act with maximum toughness.” Kazakhtelecom, the country’s largest telecommunications company, shut off internet access throughout the country on Wednesday afternoon. Kazakhstan, with a population of 19 million, is by far the richest country in Central Asia, with a GDP per capita of $27,000 and more than $35 billion in reserves, yet it was still possible for the country to devolve into chaos in a matter of days. The instability is a potential source of concern among foreign oil companies, particularly in the United States. ExxonMobil and Chevron have invested tens of billions of dollars in western Kazakhstan, the region where the unrest began this month. A Chevron-led consortium is in the midst of a project to expand output at the on-land Tengiz oil field at an estimated cost of $37 billion, one of the single largest energy investments in the world today. Many Kazakhs were incensed by the increase in the gas price because their country is not just the recipient of tens of billions in energy investments but also an exporter of oil and gas. The price rise added to the economic misery in a country where the coronavirus pandemic has helped underscore severe income inequality. Mukhtar Umbetov, a rights activist who took part in protests in Aktau, said that while the turmoil may have been sparked by economic grievances and the pandemic, the root cause was the absence of democratic processes. The Kazakh government, he said, “has removed all legal ways to participate in politics.” Speaking by phone from Aktau, on the Caspian Sea, he said that “people don’t have any political intermediaries who would solve problems that exist in the country.” Nevertheless, he said, in a country where the average salary is $570 a month — and where many earn considerably less than that — economic resentments are not to be discounted. “Kazakhstan is rich, but its natural resources are not working in the interests of all; they work in the interests of a small group of people.” As the protests have unfolded, the demands of the demonstrators have expanded to include broader political liberalization. Among the changes they seek is the direct election of Kazakhstan’s regional leaders, rather than the current system of presidential appointment. Much of the ire has been directed at the country’s autocratic former ruler, Mr. Nazarbayev, who led the country for 30 years after independence in 1991. Mr. Tokayev became president after elections derided by Western observers as flawed. After that, Mr. Nazarbayev was formally recognized as the “leader of the nation,” and the country’s capital was renamed Nur-Sultan in his honor. Until now, he had been widely regarded as the shadow leader of Kazakhstan despite the formal transition of power to Mr. Tokayev. But that appears set to change. On Tuesday, Mr. Tokayev dismissed Samat Abish, Mr. Nazarbayev’s nephew, from the position of first deputy head of the country’s national security service, a successor to the K.G.B. And on Wednesday, Mr. Tokayev replaced Mr. Nazarbayev as head of the country’s Security Council. Speaking about the unrest, Mr. Tokayev asserted that the protests were “highly organized” as part of a “meticulously thought-out plan of conspirators, who were motivated financially.” He said that people had been “killed and wounded” and that “crowds of bandit elements beat and mocked servicemen, took them naked through the streets, abused women and robbed shops.” The countries of the former Soviet Union are watching the protests closely. For Russia, the events represent another possible challenge to autocratic power in a neighboring country. Russia intervened militarily in Ukraine in 2014 after pro-democracy protests erupted there, and the Kremlin offered support to the Belarusian dictator Aleksandr G. Lukashenko as he violently crushed peaceful protests against his autocratic rule in 2020. The Kremlin currently has “peacekeeping” forces stationed in Transnistria and the contested territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, as well as supporting Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. It also occupies parts of Georgia and Abkhazia."

By almost any measure, the criminal investigation of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol is a prosecutorial effort of unparalleled complexity and scope. For an entire year, federal agents in almost every state have been poring over mounting stacks of tipster reports, interviews with witnesses, public social media posts and private messages obtained by warrants. They have also collected nearly 14,000 hours of video — from media outlets, surveillance cameras and police-worn body cameras — enough raw footage that it would take a year and a half of around-the-clock viewing to get through it. While the Justice Department has called the inquiry one of the largest in its history, traditional law enforcement officials have not been acting alone. Working with information from online sleuths who style themselves as “Sedition Hunters,” the authorities have made more than 700 arrests — with little sign of slowing down. The government estimates that as many as 2,500 people who took part in the events of Jan. 6 could be charged with federal crimes. That includes more than 1,000 incidents that prosecutors believe could be assaults. As of this week, more than 225 people have been accused of attacking or interfering with the police that day. About 275 have been charged with what the government describes as the chief political crime on Jan. 6: obstructing Congress’s duty to certify the 2020 presidential vote count. A little over 300 people have been charged with petty crimes alone, mostly trespassing and disorderly conduct. But a big question hangs over the prosecutions: Will the Justice Department move beyond charging the rioters themselves? So far, the department has provided no public indication of the degree to which it might be pursuing a case against former President Donald J. Trump and the circle of his allies who helped inspire the chaos with their baseless claims of election fraud. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland is scheduled to give a speech on Wednesday, one day before the anniversary of the attack on the Capitol, but is not expected to provide any signals about the direction of the department’s investigation. A spokeswoman said he would not address any specific cases or individuals. On Capitol Hill, the House select committee on Jan. 6 is interviewing witnesses and has issued subpoenas to a number of high-profile figures allied with Mr. Trump. And with Mr. Garland and the Justice Department remaining mum about their intentions, members of the committee have signaled a willingness to exert pressure on the department, saying they would consider making criminal referrals if their investigation turns up evidence that could support a prosecution against Mr. Trump or others. Even the prosecutions of those who rioted at the Capitol have presented an array of moral and legal challenges that have bedeviled judges, prosecutors and defense lawyers. Overworked courts have tried to balance the laborious exchange of discovery materials with speedy trial protections and to manage the bleak conditions at Washington’s local jails where some defendants are being held without bail. They have also faced a fundamental, underlying tension: how to mete out justice on an individual level to hundreds of defendants who together helped form a violent mob. With rare speed for a large-scale prosecution, more than 160 people — or slightly more than 20 percent of all who have been charged — have pleaded guilty at this point. Of those, not quite half have already been sentenced. A few weeks ago, Robert Palmer, a Florida man who hurled a fire extinguisher at police officers, was sentenced to more than five years in prison, the longest term handed down so far. In November, one of the most familiar figures in the attack — Jacob Chansley, the so-called QAnon Shaman, who breached the Senate floor in a horned helmet with a fur draped over his shoulders — was sentenced to 41 months, a term he is appealing. Beneath the headlines, however, there has been a steady stream of penalties for lower-profile defendants: bricklayers, grandmothers, college students, artists, church leaders and long-haul truckers who, by and large, have admitted to little more than illegally entering the Capitol. Many, if not most, have avoided incarceration, sentenced to probation or stints of home confinement. Others have received only modest sentences, ranging from a few weeks to a few months. In court, those accused of minor crimes have almost always expressed remorse, saying their behavior was foolish, embarrassing or out of character. Some have broken into tears or, in one case, physically collapsed. Others have vowed never to attend a political rally again. Federal judges have taken slightly different positions on how to punish the defendants. Judge Trevor N. McFadden, appointed by Mr. Trump, often prefaces his sentences by calling the events that day “a national embarrassment” — though he has frequently declined to jail petty offenders. Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, an Obama appointee, has often given sentences higher than those requested by the government. Her go-to phrase: “There must be consequences.” Judge Amit P. Mehta told John Lolos, a defendant clearly steeped in election fraud conspiracies, that not only had he been lied to, but those who had done the lying were not “paying the consequences.” “Those who orchestrated Jan. 6 have in no meaningful sense been held accountable,” said Judge Mehta, another Obama appointee. “In a sense, Mr. Lolos, I think you are a pawn.” From the start, prosecutors faced a unique legal problem: Never before had members of Congress been forced from the House and Senate floors while finalizing the transition of presidential power. What law should be used to charge this crime? The government settled on an unusual obstruction law — the obstruction of an official proceeding before Congress. It brought the charge against scores of people believed to have disrupted the democratic process, often alongside more traditional counts of trespassing, vandalism and assault. The obstruction law, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, had a few advantages. First, it allowed the authorities to avoid deploying more politically fraught — and harder-to-prove — counts like sedition or insurrection. It also permitted prosecutors to home in on the specific behavior of defendants and judge how much their actions contributed to the chaos that day. If someone went deep into the Capitol, say, or took some other action that helped to chase officials from their duties, chances are they have been charged with an obstruction count. But many defense lawyers have claimed the law was wrongly used. Passed in 2002 as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which sought to clamp down on corporate malfeasance, the measure was initially intended to prohibit things like shredding documents or tampering with witnesses in congressional inquiries. Defense lawyers have argued that prosecutors have stretched the law beyond its scope and used it to criminalize behavior that too closely resembles ordinary protest protected by the First Amendment. In the past few weeks, however, five federal judges have ruled that the law is valid, and it now seems certain it will be permitted in scores of Jan. 6 prosecutions, including some that will soon go to trial. The earliest Capitol riot trials are scheduled to begin next month. When the proceedings start, jurors will most likely get a glimpse of how the government believes members of the mob worked together. The first trial, set to begin on Feb. 24, will focus on Robert Gieswein of Colorado, a self-proclaimed militiaman charged with assaulting officers with a chemical spray. In court papers, the government has indicated that it intends to show the jury videos of Mr. Gieswein’s assaults and to offer evidence that he told a reporter he was at the Capitol on Jan. 6 “to execute these fascists.” The papers also suggest that prosecutors believe Mr. Gieswein may try to argue he was acting in self-defense when he fought with the police — a strategy that several other defendants have embraced. A second trial, scheduled to start on Feb. 28, will feature another accused militiaman, Guy Reffitt, a former oil industry employee who the government has said is a member of the Texas Three Percenters radical gun rights movement. At Mr. Reffitt’s trial, prosecutors plan to tell the jury that he brought an AR-15 rifle and a semiautomatic handgun to Washington, and was wearing a special holster designed for concealed weapons. The government has also said it will call a Secret Service agent who will testify that he and other agents protecting Vice President Mike Pence that day were adversely affected by the chaos and violence. At least so far, prosecutors appear to be building their cases from the bottom up, starting with those they can accuse of definable crimes and looking for potential links to others. That said, one possible avenue for moving up the food chain is the case of Owen Shroyer, the right-hand man of the far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Mr. Shroyer marched on the Capitol with Mr. Jones and Ali Alexander, the Stop the Steal organizer, on Jan. 6 and was arrested months later on disorderly conduct charges. Neither Mr. Jones nor Mr. Alexander has been charged. But both men had connections to the Trump White House. Mr. Jones helped organize the rally at the Ellipse near the White House before the riot and has said that White House officials told him that he was to lead a march to the Capitol, where Mr. Trump would speak, according to the House committee investigating Jan. 6, which issued a subpoena to him in November. It remains unclear how two other investigations into lawyers who have worked with Mr. Trump — Sidney Powell and Rudolph W. Giuliani — might also intersect with the inquiry into the riot. While neither of those investigations, which appear to be focused on financial improprieties and federal lobbying laws, are directly connected to the Capitol attack, both Ms. Powell and Mr. Giuliani helped Mr. Trump spread lies about the election before Jan. 6. Perhaps the best source for potential charges against prominent political defendants is the House select committee. While the panel’s stated goal was to put together an authoritative record of the attack and recommend ways to ensure it never happened again, investigators have started to consider making criminal referrals to the Justice Department. Even as prosecutors have demonstrated with vivid evidence the pro-Trump nature of the mob and the extent of the violence, Mr. Trump and his allies have continued seeking to rewrite the history of the Capitol attack through a nearly yearlong disinformation campaign. “The real insurrection happened on Nov. 3, the Presidential Election, not on Jan. 6 — which was a day of protesting the Fake Election results,” Mr. Trump declared in November. At different moments, conservative commentators and politicians have dismissed those who took part in the assault on the Capitol as mere tourists and have lionized them as martyrs and political prisoners. They have alternately blamed undercover F.B.I. agents and leftists in disguise for the storming of the building. One group of people has seen through these baseless claims: a subset of the defendants who have been prosecuted for attacking the Capitol. Several have stood up in court and admitted they felt betrayed by Mr. Trump and were deluded by his efforts to portray the election as rigged. At his sentencing hearing, for example, Mr. Palmer said that he had recently recognized that the former president and those around him were “spitting out the false narrative about a stolen election and how it was ‘our duty’ to stand up to tyranny.” Eventually, he said, he came to understand that “they were the tyrannical ones, desperate to hold on to power at any cost.”"
42,The New York Times,nytimes,Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York said Wednesday that she would propose spending $10 billion to help rebuild a health care work force exhausted and depleted by the pandemic. https://nyti.ms/33aSCMI,https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3HEd1sl%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0xhPRRqskVInRm0-2eMvKPZR4CXe9IrcnAefqJBT7aGjTKTItvrUufRkQ&h=AT29oYOU8DK9Isjxk6PcWlOMCIKcjhDOd0uCAopeFzu2EhegOeb_rdRgh5Se5se6WkEQuVpOVE_7GzhncG6Y4NaGSbHgqeI_DHpLdh0PjXFoNQ0sh6xkITBiPbMEOb9C29mpmGSTLBVgMtA4yrZ2&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT1263w8VEYBQbMNKoeT1nEMjtZ533rBkmcuVY6JiKMWr7UsesHO7nRhdVTdbU0IuWqeU5_gQvMUiibtHbZH50ZZIy2txDMxnuK42R9rsWlzI2WtwojnEbYirV4VsD94oPT4fp-OHNcgViCh4CKxF-tiemMmxEbA4CoZvmKeJEVic7yo,1d,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday endorsed booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for children ages 12 to 17, citing rising infections in teens and young adults and a troubling increase in pediatric hospitalizations. As the contagious Omicron variant spreads through the country, public health officials have seized on extra vaccine doses as a first line of defense. Pfizer-BioNTech boosters are now authorized for any American older than 12 who is five months past his or her second dose of the vaccine. An advisory committee recommended the changes following a meeting on Wednesday. They were endorsed by Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director, on Wednesday night. Adolescents ages 12 to 15 may begin to receive boosters immediately. Adolescents ages 16 and older were already permitted to receive booster shots, but on Wednesday the C.D.C. panel strengthened the recommendation. The advisory panel followed a similar move earlier this week by the Food and Drug Administration, which authorized Pfizer-BioNtech boosters for adolescents and shortened the recommended time interval between the initial vaccine regimen and the booster. The F.D.A. also endorsed “an additional primary dose” of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for moderately or severely immunocompromised children aged 5 to 11, to be given 28 days after their second shots.  Studies suggest that vaccine side effects are minimal in children, although there is lingering concern about a link to myocarditis, a rare inflammation of the heart muscle that occurs more frequently in young men, following vaccination. In Israel, which started administering boosters to adolescents aged 12 to 15 in June and rigorously tracks side effects, the health ministry identified two cases of myocarditis, among some 41,600 adolescents in this age group who received the booster. Both children were hospitalized briefly and have fully recovered, said Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, an Israeli health official who addressed the committee. The booster dramatically reduced infection rates among children aged 12 to 15, Dr. Alroy-Preis said. Although most infected youngsters generally did not experience severe Covid disease that required hospitalization, two children — one boy and one girl — have died, she said. But while much of the committee’s discussion focused on the risks of the vaccine and its side effects, Dr. Camille Kotton, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who specializes in transplant and immunocompromised patients, said the focus should be on the disease itself, which is having a devastating effect on vulnerable and immunocompromised patients. “This is an important thing to think about — the risk of myocarditis from the disease itself,” Dr. Kotton said. Though Omicron is generally perceived as causing less severe disease, she said, she now sees numerous patients on life support. Some have died. “It’s a horrible state of affairs,” she said. “The highly infectious nature of Omicron is such that patients who have been incredibly careful the last two years have been getting infected with awful outcomes.” Dr. Katherine Poehling, director of pediatric population health at Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., expressed similar sentiments. “There are children waiting in the emergency department 18 hours and longer to get into the hospital because we’re so full,” she said. “We have parents asking us can their children get a booster dose, like older children.” But several committee members said they were increasingly disturbed that only a minority of younger children are getting vaccinated at all, and said it is critical to increase the rates and adhere to other prevention strategies, like masking. “We can’t put all of the burden on the people who are willing to get vaccinated,” said Lynn Bahta, a committee member who is a registered nurse with the Minnesota Department of Health. “When we have only half our adolescents vaccinated, that adds more burden as well. I am so concerned that the burden of disease prevention is all falling on the vaccinated and them getting the boosters.” More than 70 percent of people 12 and older in the United States are fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C. Children younger than age 5 are still not eligible for vaccination. Americans aged 18 and older who received Moderna’s vaccine can get a booster of any available coronavirus vaccine six months after the second shot. Those who received Johnson & Johnson’s single-shot vaccine may get a booster dose of any available vaccine two months after their first shot. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are both strongly preferred over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the C.D.C. has said. Only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is authorized for children ages 5 to 11; boosters are not yet recommended for this group. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday said it was not changing its definition of “full vaccination” against the coronavirus. But the agency changed its emphasis on the appropriate regimen, tweaking how it referred to the shots. The agency said that three doses of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna’s vaccines should be considered “up-to-date” inoculations, and that Johnson & Johnson recipients should receive a second dose, preferably of Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech, to also be considered up to date. The move amounted to a recommendation from federal health officials that Americans should change how they talk about vaccination schedules. People 12 years and older are eligible for boosters. “Consistent with how public health has historically viewed or even talked about how we recommend vaccines, we are now recommending that individuals stay up to date with additional doses that they are eligible for,” Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, said at a White House news briefing on Wednesday. The C.D.C. did not change the definition of what qualifies as full vaccination — a subject of intense interest to corporations, schools, state health departments and professional sports leagues, which have themselves been reconsidering what it means to be fully vaccinated. “The technical definition of ‘fully vaccinated’ — two doses of an mRNA vaccine or one dose of the J & J vaccine — has not changed,” Kristen Nordlund, a C.D.C. spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Individuals are considered fully vaccinated once they have received their primary series.” She added that the agency recommend that people “stay ‘up to date’ by receiving any additional doses they are eligible for, according to C.D.C.’s recommendations, to ensure they have optimal protection.” Parents across Chicago raced to find child care on Wednesday morning after jarring news: Classes in the nation’s third-largest public school district were canceled. The teachers’ union and Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration had failed to agree on how to keep schools open during an Omicron-fueled virus surge. Across the country, the wildly contagious Omicron variant has infected millions and complicated the return to classrooms and workplaces. But nowhere has returning to school been more acrimonious and unpredictable than in Chicago, where, after two days back in classrooms following winter break, 73 percent of teachers voted to stop reporting to work. The city responded by calling off school altogether, refusing the teachers’ call for remote instruction. With no deal reached by Wednesday evening, district officials said classes would be canceled again on Thursday. The abrupt pause in the academic calendar, rooted in years of enmity between the Chicago Teachers Union and City Hall, jumbled plans for hundreds of thousands of students and posed another major test for Ms. Lightfoot, a Democrat whose tenure has been marked by labor strife, the pandemic and a surge in homicides. “If they are in class and Covid is rampaging, that’s a problem. If they are not there and out on the streets, that’s a problem,” said Tamar Manasseh, who leads an anti-violence group in the city, and who said she was looking into ways to help children with nowhere to go during the day. “This has put us in an untenable situation.” Ms. Lightfoot, whose disagreements with the Chicago Teachers Union date back to a strike in the early months of her term, said in an interview that the two sides remained far apart as negotiations continued. Ms. Lightfoot said she intended to take legal action against the union, and on Monday evening said the city had filed an unfair labor practices complaint. The school district opened buildings for meal distribution on Wednesday and published a list of places where parents could get emergency child care. “The consequences of the union acting like this time and time again are profound,” Ms. Lightfoot said. She added, “You think about the consequences for the families to be faced with the hostage choice of either going to work or taking care of their kids and home-schooling — no parent should be put in that position.” Australia blocked Novak Djokovic, the top-ranked men’s tennis player in the world, from entering the nation ahead of the Australian Open tournament, after immigration authorities said he didn’t meet entry requirements. “Mr. Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia, and his visa has been subsequently canceled,” the Australian Border Force said in a statement. “Noncitizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa canceled will be detained and removed from Australia.” His arrival in the country on Wednesday was mired in confusion after an airport dispute about the validity of his visa and questions about the evidence supporting an exemption from being vaccinated. Australia allows travelers who can show proof either of vaccination or of a valid medical reason for not being vaccinated to enter the country without quarantining. Djokovic, an outspoken critic of vaccine mandates, has not said publicly whether he has been vaccinated against the coronavirus. But he announced on Tuesday that he had received a medical exemption from the Australian Open’s vaccine mandate to defend his title in Melbourne, where the year’s first major tennis tournament is played. Tournament officials confirmed that in a statement on Tuesday, saying his application had been reviewed by two independent panels, a procedure that strongly suggested that he was unvaccinated. An Australian newspaper, The Age, reported that a plane carrying Djokovic landed at Tullamarine Airport in Melbourne around 11:30 p.m. local time on Wednesday, and that Djokovic, who is Serbian, was still being questioned by officials from the Australian Border Force more than six hours later. Kyrie Irving, the star Nets guard, made his regular-season debut against the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night following the team’s surprise reversal of its policy to bar him from practices and road games until he received the coronavirus vaccine. Irving looked rusty early on against the Pacers, missing his first three shots. But in the second quarter in Indianapolis, he began to heat up and scored 8 straight points. Irving declined to be vaccinated for Covid-19 before the season, making him ineligible to play in New York City because of a local vaccine mandate at sports arenas that went into effect in September. The Nets, citing concerns about team chemistry, announced in October that Irving would not be permitted to play in road games either, even if laws in those cities would allow him to participate. The N.B.A. does not require players to be vaccinated. For the most part, the team has played well in Irving’s absence, and has led the Eastern Conference for much of the season. Entering Wednesday, the Nets were No. 2 in the East, behind Chicago, with a 23-12 record after losing four of their last six games. But last month, as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus began ravaging N.B.A. rosters, the Nets announced they would let Irving play in road games. Sean Marks, the team’s general manager, said at the time that the Nets were “faced with a roster that has been decimated over the course of the last several days.” Several of the Nets’ top players, including Kevin Durant and James Harden, have missed games because of the league’s virus-related health and safety protocols. Irving was immediately placed into the protocols as well. The N.B.A.’s rules say an unvaccinated player can be placed into the protocols because of a positive or inconclusive test, or a confirmed exposure to a person who had tested positive. Players can be cleared to play again through testing and isolation periods that vary according to the players’ symptoms but that can be as short as a few days. When Irving returned to action on Wednesday night, all of the Nets’ roster was available except guard Joe Harris, who is out with an ankle injury. The United States Postal Service says it wants an exemption to the federal vaccine-or-test mandate because it could hinder its ability to deliver the mail. “The Postal Service is seeking temporary relief because it wants to ensure that its ability to deliver mail and packages is not hindered amid the current disruptions in the nation’s supply chain,” Darlene Casey, a U.S.P.S. spokeswoman, said in a statement on Wednesday. In November, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued an emergency order requiring that organizations with more than 100 employees require their workers to either be vaccinated against Covid-19 or be tested weekly and subjected to stricter face-covering requirements. The U.S.P.S. formally requested a variance from that order in a letter to OSHA dated Tuesday. “We are now in the middle of our peak season (mid-October through January), which is our busiest and most challenging time of year,” Deputy Postmaster General Doug A. Tulino wrote in the letter, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times. “The American people are relying on us to timely deliver their mail and packages throughout the holiday season — which aren’t limited to holiday packages but include critical items like Treasury checks, Covid-19 tests and pharmaceuticals.” He added that the mandate was “likely to result in the loss of many employees” just when they are needed most. Such a loss “would have a potentially catastrophic impact on our ability to provide service to the American public when demand is at its highest,” Mr. Tulino wrote. The Postal Service requires all employees and contractors “who interact with the public” to wear face coverings “when there is a state, local or tribal directive in place that requires face coverings to be worn,” Mr. Tulino wrote. Face coverings are also required for employees and contractors who cannot maintain social distancing, he wrote.  Those policies apply regardless of a person’s vaccination status, he said. In the last 18 months, the Postal Service has received “only a handful of citations” related to pandemic restrictions, which, Mr. Tulino wrote, “illustrates that the Postal Service’s established Covid-19 mitigation measures have been extremely successful to date.”   Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York said she would ask the State Legislature to make the sale of drinks to go at bars and restaurants legal, cementing in law a popular emergency policy that helped the battered hospitality industry weather the first year and a half of the pandemic. In her annual state of the state address, Governor Hochul said that legalizing to-go drinks was “something our bars and restaurants have been asking for” because it was “a critical revenue stream during the lean times last year.” Her aides said she would send a bill to the Legislature during the current session. She added, “Cheers, New York.” The previous governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, had used his emergency powers during the first year of the pandemic to put in place a special “off-premises privileges” rule allowing to-go alcohol sales. The measure was intended to throw a lifeline to the struggling food and beverage industry. Customers quickly grew accustomed to the convenience of takeout drinks. But the rule died when the state of emergency ended last June and the Legislature did not pass a measure that would extend it. Several other states, including Iowa and Arizona, have legalized the sale of takeout alcohol during the pandemic. Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, welcomed the news that Ms. Hochul would push for legislative action on the issue this year. “The drinks to go policy provides critically important revenue streams to struggling restaurants and bars and is extraordinarily popular with the public, unsurprisingly,” he said in a statement. Mr. Rigie added, “We commend Governor Hochul for her leadership, and we look forward to toasting her administration and the State Legislature once this important policy is reinstated.” The announcement on Wednesday came as the highly contagious Omicron variant has driven cases to record highs in New York State. New daily cases were averaging more than 66,000 by Jan. 4, according to a New York Times database. The Italian government made Covid-19 vaccination mandatory for people 50 and older on Wednesday, as it sought to curb the explosive growth in new cases because of the Omicron variant. The government also approved rules that prevent the unvaccinated from entering businesses, including banks, post offices and some stores. Previously, workers older than 50 could show proof of a negative test to do their jobs. Now they will have to be vaccinated or show proof they have recovered from an infection. The measures go into effect on Feb. 15. “We want to curb the growth of infections and push the Italians who haven’t gotten vaccinated yet to do so,” Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, said in a statement on Wednesday. “We are targeting in particular age groups that are at higher risk of being hospitalized to reduce the pressure on hospitals and save lives.” Mr. Draghi added that the government’s goal was to keep hospitals working while, at the same time, keeping schools and businesses open. With new infections rising fast, scientists fear that hospitals may soon have to shut down regular activities to devote beds and personnel to Covid patients. Almost 7 percent of Italians over 50 are estimated to have not received any vaccination yet. Vaccination rates are high in Italy, the first country outside China to be severely hit by the pandemic. But there still are millions of unvaccinated people. The government also set aside 92.5 million euros, or about $104.6 million, for free rapid testing in schools to lessen the effect of the virus and avoid the huge use of remote learning, said the education minister, Patrizio Bianchi. A small, new real-world study suggests that two widely used at-home antigen tests, the Abbott BinaxNOW and Quidel QuickVue, may fail to detect some Omicron infections even when people are carrying high levels of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, focused on 30 people infected with the virus at five workplaces that experienced what were most likely outbreaks of the Omicron variant in December. The people received both saliva-based P.C.R. tests and rapid antigen tests using nasal swabs. It took three days, on average, for people to test positive on a rapid antigen test after their first positive P.C.R. result. In four cases, people transmitted the virus to others while the rapid test showed the negative result, according to the study, which was conducted by several members of the Covid-19 Sports and Society Working Group. It is not clear whether the infections were missed because the antigen tests are inherently less sensitive to Omicron or because saliva tests may be better at detecting the new variant. But the results are consistent with other preliminary evidence that the at-home tests that many Americans have come to rely on — at least as currently administered, with a nasal swab — may fail to detect some Omicron cases in the first days of infection. The researchers said they shared their results with federal officials — including at the White House, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — in real-time, as the outbreaks were occurring last month. The study comes a week after the Food and Drug Administration released its own update on the effectiveness of the rapid antigen tests. “Early data suggests that antigen tests do detect the Omicron variant but may have reduced sensitivity,” the agency said. President Biden’s coronavirus response coordinator said Wednesday that, beginning next week, Americans struggling to get tested for the coronavirus will be able to have the cost of rapid at-home tests reimbursed by their insurers, but offered no specific promises about when free tests would be available. The remarks by Jeff Zients, who leads the White House pandemic response, come two weeks after Mr. Biden said his administration would buy half a billion rapid tests to distribute free to the public, and that insurance companies would begin reimbursing people for tests they purchased on their own. Mr. Biden said at the time that the free tests would be available “in the coming weeks.” With the Omicron variant of the coronavirus fueling a sharp rise in cases across the country, demand for all kinds of tests is far outpacing supply. In some areas, people are waiting in long lines to take the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., tests that are administered at medical clinics. Rapid at-home tests are flying off pharmacy shelves. “We know this remains frustrating for people getting tested in many parts of the country,” Mr. Zients said on Wednesday. “So we are working to do all we can.” The administration’s new “test to stay” guidance for schools, in which students exposed to the virus can remain in the classroom if they test negative, is among the factors driving up demand for the rapid tests. Last week, when Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, omitted a testing requirement from new isolation guidelines, she was greeted with a chorus of criticism from public health experts who said a negative test should be required before an infected person ends a five-day isolation period. On Tuesday, the C.D.C. amended the latest guidance — not to say that testing was required, but to say that people who wanted to end their isolation periods after five days and had access to tests may choose to take them. If the test results are positive, they should stay home for another five days, the guidance says; if negative, and their symptoms are resolving, they may go out, but should continue to wear masks in public for another five days. Addressing reporters on Wednesday, Dr. Walensky said she omitted a testing requirement from the guidance because rapid tests are not authorized by the Food and Drug Administration to determine whether someone is infectious to others; they are authorized merely to detect infection, and are meant to be used serially, as is the case in schools. But after the guidance was released, she said, “it became very clear that people were interested in using the rapid tests,” and since that was the case, she at least wanted to “provide guidance on how they should be used.” The recommendation for the general public is different from the one for health care workers, who are required to test negative before going back to work. Dr. Walensky said the C.D.C. was always more conservative in its recommendations for health workers, because they care for vulnerable people, including those with weak immune systems. Matching testing supply with demand has been a challenge for both the Trump and Biden administrations. Early in the pandemic, there was a shortage of tests and the components that make up test kits. By late 2020, manufacturers had expanded production. But once vaccines arrived, the Biden administration put less emphasis on testing. Demand plunged, and manufacturers pulled back. Now the manufacturers are running at full speed again. Mr. Zients said manufacturers would begin delivering rapid tests kits to the federal government next week, and that the administration would set up a “free and easy system, including a website” where Americans could order them. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Wednesday that new federal testing sites would open this week in the District of Columbia and Philadelphia, followed soon after by Maine, Maryland, Nevada, Delaware, Texas and Washington state. She noted that mobile testing sites were already open in New York City and New Jersey. LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday scaled back restrictions on people traveling to England as the Omicron variant appears to be so widespread that measures tightened in November can no longer stem the spread. Starting Friday, vaccinated travelers will no longer need to take a test before their journey, Mr. Johnson said in a statement to Parliament on Wednesday. They will still need to take one within two days of arrival, he said, though a rapid antigen test is enough. As of Sunday, the government will not require a more expensive P.C.R. test. The changes were welcomed by the country’s hard-hit aviation industry. Mr. Johnson defended the stricter travel restrictions that were put in place in late November, when the Omicron variant was first identified, as necessary to slow its arrival. “But now,” he said, “Omicron is so prevalent, these measures are having limited impact on the growth in cases, while continuing to pose significant costs on our travel industry.” The decision announced Wednesday effectively takes Britain back to the same rules it operated in October. But unvaccinated passengers will still be required to take a pre-departure test and to self-isolate on arrival for 10 days, during which time they must take two P.C.R. tests. There were 194,747 daily cases recorded in the United Kingdom, according to data released on Wednesday, near the record of 218,724 cases announced on Tuesday. Mr. Johnson’s announcement covered England only, but Wales said it would take a similar step, and Scotland and Northern Ireland were expected to follow suit. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, an industry body, said the relaxed rules were a “hugely welcome move at a critical time in the booking season for passengers.” The change would, he said in a statement, “provide a massive boost to those wanting to travel abroad or come to the U.K. this year.” He added, “People will now be able to book knowing that, for the fully vaccinated, all emergency testing restrictions have been removed.” PARIS — Faced with a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant, President Emmanuel Macron of France said Wednesday that he wanted to “piss off” millions of his citizens who refuse to get vaccinated by squeezing them out of the country’s public spaces. By shocking the nation with a vulgarity three months before presidential elections, Mr. Macron was relaying not only a public health message, but also a political one. He appeared to be calculating that tapping into the growing public anger against the unvaccinated held more potential electoral rewards than the risk of angering an anti-vaccination minority whose support he has little hope of ever getting. Using his harshest language yet to urge the recalcitrant to get their shots, Mr. Macron said he would not “throw them in prison” or “vaccinate them by force.” But he made it clear he meant to make their lives harder. In doing so, Mr. Macron, an inveterate political gambler who became the nation’s youngest leader ever five years ago, effectively kicked off his campaign for re-election Wednesday, drawing clear lines between his supporters and opponents. He also moved the focus of debate away from themes like immigration and Islam that have dominated the political race so far and that are advantageous to his strongest rivals, on the right and far right. Mr. Macron was clearly seeking to tap into a rich political vein that his counterparts have been more cautious to exploit: anger among the majority of vaccinated people at a minority who refuse to get vaccinated and disproportionately occupy hospital beds. More than 77 percent of French people, and 92 percent of those 12 and older, have received at least two doses, according to the government. “The unvaccinated, I really want to piss them off,” Mr. Macron said, using a French word that is more vulgar, explaining that a new, reinforced vaccine pass would make it impossible for the unvaccinated to go to restaurants and cafes, or the theater and cinemas. Their recalcitrance, as well as the surge in cases in France, is threatening to undermine his success so far in tackling the pandemic. RIO DE JANEIRO — While Rio de Janeiro’s renowned Carnival parade will go on, the city will cancel its street parties, which ordinarily draw millions of revelers, the mayor says, citing the Omicron variant. The freewheeling public celebrations “won’t be possible,” Mayor Eduardo Paes Casaid at a news conference on Tuesday. “It’s been decided: there won’t be street carnival in the tradition of the past.” Mr. Paes said the official parade, in which samba groups put on elaborately choreographed shows flanked by bleachers that seat 56,000 people, would be held, with some health precautions. Last year, Carnival was canceled in its entirely because of the pandemic, but for many Brazilians, the real show is the street parties, and Cariocas, as Rio residents are known, were devastated to learn that they would not take place. “I was very excited, very hopeful, for the 2022 Carnival, even more so after a year without Carnival,” said João Ramos, 26. Mr. Ramos, a designer, said that as soon as he read the news, he shared it with friends, who had already been discussing what costumes to wear. “It poured cold water on us, everyone was so sad,” he said. Still, Mr. Ramos said, the decision is understandable. Already the effect of year-end celebrations can be seen: The number of cases is ticking up again, after plunging for months. As Carnival approached, many Brazilians had begun cautiously rehearsing again, planning for that outburst of samba-fueled joy when they and millions of visitors take over public spaces and shake off the previous year’s sorrows. After two years of a pandemic, they said, it was sorely needed. “With most Brazilians fully immunized, we thought it was happening,” said Tatiana Paz, the organizer of one street performance group. “But then the situation worsened again, and there is nothing we can do about it.” Other major cities such as Olinda, São Luís, and Florianópolis have also canceled their carnival events in the past 24 hours. Rio canceled both the parade and the street parties in 2021, when Brazil’s death toll surged as its vaccination campaign was off to a slow start. But toward the end of the year, as shots became more widely available, Brazilians embraced them: About 68 percent of the country’s population is fully vaccinated, and the country’s caseload and death toll plunged. The period of relative calm that followed allowed the population to begin socializing again. Streets, beaches, and bars became packed as summer set in. On Copacabana beach, the sky was filled with fireworks as onlookers welcomed the New Year.  However, cases started rising again as Omicron spread around the world. Rio’s annual Carnival, considered to be one of the largest in the world, takes place in the weeks leading up to Ash Wednesday, the Western Christian holy day that marks the start of Lent. Ash Wednesday falls on March 2 this year. The city’s tradition, with its lively music and elaborate costumes, has endured and often thrived even in difficult times. Brazilians have danced through wars, hyperinflation, repressive military rule, runaway street violence and the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic. Official calls to postpone Carnival in Brazil in 1892 (for sanitation reasons) and 1912 (to mourn the death of a national hero) were largely ignored. In another city famous for Carnival, New Orleans, this year’s Mardi Gras parades appear to be moving forward. The event was canceled in 2021. For the second year in a row, the Grammy Awards have been pushed back by the coronavirus pandemic. The 64th annual ceremony, which had been set for Jan. 31 in Los Angeles, has been rescheduled, according to a joint statement on Wednesday from the Recording Academy and CBS, as the Omicron variant has led to a surge in cases nationwide. The new date will be announced soon, the statement said, noting, “The health and safety of those in our music community, the live audience, and the hundreds of people who work tirelessly to produce our show remains our top priority.” Last year’s show was postponed by six weeks as cases spiked, and before vaccinations were widely available. Last week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, predicted that the latest wave of the pandemic may reach its peak in the United States by the end of January. This year the composer and bandleader Jon Batiste has 11 Grammy nominations, more than any other artist, and will compete for both album and record of the year. Other top nominees include Olivia Rodrigo, Justin Bieber, Billie Eilish and Doja Cat. No performers have been announced yet. Gov. Kathy M. Hochul of New York said Wednesday that she would propose spending $10 billion to help rebuild a health care work force that has been exhausted and depleted by the nearly two-year-old pandemic. “We simply do not have enough health care workers in our hospitals, or in our long-term care facilities, in our ambulances, or in the homes of our loved ones,” the governor said in her first State of the State speech in Albany, labeling the moment a crisis.  The state health work force is about 6 percent smaller than it was before the pandemic. Even before the coronavirus strained the system, officials had projected the work force would need to grow by 11 percent by the end of 2022 to meet demand, the governor’s office reported. “We must stop the current hemorrhaging of health care workers,” Ms. Hochul said in her speech. “And we’re going to do it. Not just by saying we owe them a debt of gratitude, but actually paying them the debt we owe.” She proposed spending more than $4 billion to support wages and bonuses to increase the number of health care workers in the state by 20 percent over the next five years. That would include up to $3,000 in bonuses for all full-time health care workers who remain in their positions for a year, and $2 billion in spending on health care capital infrastructure and improved lab capacity. The governor also wants to offer free tuition to students who are preparing to work in high-demand health occupations and to provide stipends to make up for lost income while they are in school. Doctors could receive loan forgiveness up to $120,000 if they work in underserved areas for three years. She also wants to start a “Nurses Across N.Y.” Program to place nurses in underserved areas. Hospitals across the state are reporting that staffing is the biggest challenge of this stage of the pandemic, as new cases soared this week to levels not seen since the first wave in May 2020. The result has been packed emergency rooms and waits for beds at some institutions, though fewer patients are requiring intensive care because of vaccinations and what scientists say is the milder nature of the Omicron variant. As the governor spoke in Albany, the new mayor of New York, Eric Adams, laid out a plan to provide $111 million in new funding for the city’s public hospitals to help them cope with the surge in patients caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant. He also announced a $27 million loan program for the city’s so-called safety-net hospitals, which are outside the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation network. A small, new real-world study suggests that two widely used at-home antigen tests, the Abbott BinaxNow and Quidel QuickVue, may fail to detect Omicron infections when people are carrying high levels of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, focused on 30 people, who were most likely infected with Omicron, who tested positive for the virus at workplace surveillance programs. They took both saliva-based P.C.R. tests and rapid antigen tests using nasal swabs. It took three days, on average, for people to test positive on a rapid antigen test after their first positive P.C.R. result. In four cases, people transmitted the virus to others while the rapid test showed the negative result, the study noted. It is not clear whether the infections were missed because the antigen tests are inherently less sensitive for Omicron or because saliva samples may be a better way to detect the new variant. But the results suggest that the at-home tests that many Americans have come to rely on — at least as currently administered, with a nasal swab — may be failing to detect Omicron in the first days of infection. Anne Wyllie, a microbiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and a co-author of the study, urged people to interpret negative test results with caution. “People should not ignore high risk exposures,” she said. “They should not ignore symptoms.” Rapid antigen tests, which are designed to detect proteins on the surface of the coronavirus, have always been less sensitive than P.C.R. tests, which amplify the virus’s genetic material and can detect even very small traces of the virus. But in the new study, the rapid antigen tests failed to detect the virus even in people who had high viral loads, and who were thus likely to be infectious. The tests were done over a series of up to 10 days. The discordant results overwhelmingly came during the first three days of infection. The study, by researchers at the University of Washington, the Yale School of Public Health and others, concluded: “In real-world antigen testing, the limit of detection was substantially lower than manufacturers have reported to the F.D.A. based on laboratory validation.” In 29 of 30 people, samples of the virus produced a telltale genetic pattern on P.C.R. tests, suggesting that they were likely infected with Omicron. Although the study is small and has not yet been reviewed by experts, it fits with emerging research suggesting that some rapid antigen tests may be less sensitive to Omicron than to other variants. It is also consistent with a recent report from South Africa, which suggests that saliva samples might be a better way to detect Omicron than nasal swabs. The study comes a week after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released an update that made headlines by stating: “Early data suggests that antigen tests do detect the omicron variant but may have reduced sensitivity.” An Abbott spokesman, John Koval, said on Wednesday that the finding that a P.C.R. test is more sensitive is “not new.”  “Due to immediate turnaround time, frequent rapid antigen testing does slow transmission — and with a highly infectious variant frequent testing is needed, which is not realistic with P.C.R.,” he wrote in an email. Quidel’s president, Douglas Bryant, said in a statement that the company performed recent testing using samples from South Africa and confirmed that its rapid tests are detecting the Omicron variant. “The QuickVue antigen tests are able to detect the live Omicron variant with similar performance as with other variants,” he said. Hong Kong announced a series of strict pandemic control measures on Wednesday, including suspending flights from the United States and seven other countries, as it scrambled to contain an incipient coronavirus outbreak. The new measures came as the authorities held thousands of passengers of a cruise ship under mandatory quarantine to trace a Covid case. The flight bans will deepen the city’s isolation from the outside world and mark a return to the tough restrictions the city imposed in the early days of the pandemic. Hong Kong has largely brought the coronavirus under control, but the arrival of the highly transmissible Omicron variant threatens to set off the city’s fifth wave of the pandemic. “Given the very dire situation of the pandemic, we have to grasp this critical moment,” Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said at a news conference. Mrs. Lam had said on Tuesday that no new social distancing measures were expected. But the spread of Omicron, including the infection of a person with no clear connections to the city’s first detected Omicron cluster, evidently forced a change. “We have to contain the pandemic to make sure there will not be a major outbreak in the community again,” she said. “We are racing with Omicron.” The restrictions will make it even harder to enter Hong Kong, which already imposes some of the world’s longest quarantines — up to three weeks. Under the new rules, no flights will be allowed from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines or United States for two weeks, starting on Saturday. People who have recently been in those countries will also be barred from entering Hong Kong by other routes. Large public events will be canceled, and several types of public venues — including bars, gyms and karaoke parlors — will be closed. Visitors will be barred from hospitals and nursing homes for two weeks. Dining in restaurants after 6 p.m. will be banned. But the government decided not to stop in-person instruction in schools, or to require government officials to work from home. Hong Kong has reported a growing number of imported cases involving the Omicron variant, with 133 as of Tuesday.  “If this continues, there will be tremendous strain on our quarantine and health care facilities,” said Dr. Ronald Lam, Hong Kong’s director of health. An Omicron outbreak in the city has been traced to a Cathay Pacific flight attendant who ignored quarantine requirements after returning to the city from the United States. He dined at the Moon Palace restaurant in the upscale Fashion Walk shopping mall on Dec. 27, infecting his father and at least one other person, who then infected others. The restrictions came as Hong Kong health authorities on Wednesday ordered a Royal Caribbean cruise ship to return to port early as officials searched for the contacts of a Covid-19 patient. Nine people who boarded the ship, the Spectrum of the Seas, on Jan. 2 had come into contact with the patient, who did not board the ship, the government said in a statement. The nine were told to quarantine as soon as they were identified as contacts, though they preliminarily tested negative. The vessel, which was carrying about 2,500 guests and 1,200 staff members, was scheduled to return on Thursday but was back in port as ordered on Wednesday morning, a Royal Caribbean representative said. More than 3,000 passengers of the ship were subjected to mandatory quarantine, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said at a news conference on Wednesday. All crew members and guests 12 and older had to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and provide negative test results before boarding, the cruise line said in a statement. The passengers who sailed on the ship will receive a 25 percent refund on their cruise fare, it added. The cruise line also said that it had canceled another ship scheduled to depart on Thursday and that all guests who had booked it would receive a full refund. All nine of the justices on the Supreme Court have received booster shots of the coronavirus vaccine, a spokeswoman said. The justices have all been fully vaccinated since last March. The court is preparing to hear arguments on Friday in two major challenges to the Biden administration’s efforts to address the coronavirus in the workplace. As they have since the beginning of the current term in October, the justices will hear arguments on Friday in person in the Supreme Court’s courtroom. The courthouse remains closed to the public, and lawyers and credentialed journalists are required to wear N95 masks and to have recently received a negative test for the virus. The court does not require proof of vaccination. Friday’s arguments concern measures requiring vaccination or frequent testing of workers at large employers and vaccination of health care workers at facilities that receive federal money. The court will provide a live audio feed of the arguments on its website. The Sundance Film Festival announced Wednesday that it will cancel all in-person events set for Jan. 20-30. The news comes as virus cases are spiking because of the Omicron variant. The festival will now be virtual for a second year in a row. Sundance, in a news release, said it was “a difficult decision” to cancel its first hybrid festival, which would have allowed patrons to watch films either in-person in Park City, Utah, or online via a portal. The release noted that with case numbers expected to peak in Park City and the surrounding Summit County during the week of the festival, “we cannot knowingly put our staff and community at risk. The undue stress to Summit County’s health services and our more than 1,500 staff and volunteers would be irresponsible in this climate.” The news follows the announcement earlier today that the Recording Academy would postpone the Grammys, set to take place Jan. 31 in Los Angeles. In recent weeks, the Palm Springs International Film Festival canceled its event, and both the American Film Institute awards luncheon and the Critics Choice Awards, set for January, were postponed. Last year was the first time Sundance held a completely virtual event. The multiday affair was deemed a success considering the circumstances and generated one of the highest sales in the festival’s history when Apple paid $25 million for the film “CODA,” which is now looking for recognition in the awards race. The World Health Organization says that it is monitoring a coronavirus variant detected in a small number of patients in France, but that, for now, there is little reason to worry about its spread. The B.1.640.2 variant was first identified in October and uploaded to Gisaid, a database for disease variants, on Nov. 4. Only about 20 samples have been sequenced so far, experts said this week, and only one since early December. Abdi Mahmud, a Covid incident manager with the W.H.O., told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday that the variant had been on the agency’s radar since November, but added that it did not appear to have spread widely over the past two months. “That virus has had a lot of chances to pick up,” he said. By contrast, the Omicron variant, which was first uploaded to Gisaid on Nov. 23, has more than 120,000 sequences in the database. (The vast majority of Omicron cases have not been sequenced.) It has been detected in at least 128 countries, according to the W.H.O., and is fueling record-high case numbers in many parts of the world. Concerns over the variant in France arose after researchers found that it contained 46 mutations that differed from the original version of the coronavirus. Omicron also has a high number of mutations, which researchers believe made it far more transmissible. According to a research paper that was published on a preprint server in late December, but that has not been peer-reviewed, the B.1.640.2 variant was first detected in southeastern France in a vaccinated person who had recently traveled from Cameroon. Researchers found a total of 12 cases in the area and named the variant “I.H.U.,” after the research institute in Marseille that helped identify it. “It is too early to speculate on virological, epidemiological or clinical features of this I.H.U. variant based on these 12 cases,” researchers wrote. Numerous coronavirus variants have emerged over the past two years, and the reasons that some spread widely while others do not are complex. For now, several independent researchers say there is little reason to be concerned about the I.H.U. variant. Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College in London, tweeted this week that, so far, “this virus has had a decent chance to cause trouble but never really materialised.” After going virtual last year, CES, a mega-conference in Las Vegas that’s the traditional launchpad for many of the tech industry’s latest gadgets, is trying to make a comeback. The trade show kicks off on Wednesday, with an estimated 2,200 exhibitors set to show up in person. But with the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus surging, scores of major tech companies are still presenting mostly virtually. It’s a sign that decisions to hold big in-person events at this phase of the pandemic remain far from clear-cut, the DealBook newsletter reports. Yet the organizers of CES — like those of the Winter Olympics and the Australian Open, which are set to begin soon — have decided it’s time to gather in person again. Canceling the show would “hurt thousands of smaller companies, entrepreneurs and innovators” who depend on the show to introduce their products, Gary Shapiro, the chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, the trade group that organizes CES, wrote in an opinion column in The Las Vegas Review-Journal. (The conference is also important for Las Vegas, which reaped an estimated $291 million from spending tied to it in 2020.) Mr. Shapiro noted that the conference had embraced pandemic protections like requiring attendees to be fully vaccinated and masked while on the show floor, and that testing was readily available. But many large companies have chosen to attend remotely, including Amazon, AMD, AT&T, General Motors, Google, Intel, Lenovo, Meta, Nvidia, Pinterest, T-Mobile and Twitter. That will leave “big gaps on the show floor,” Mr. Shapiro said. And CES will end a day early, in what the organizers said was a concession to safety. Other big events are delaying their return to in-person gatherings. The World Economic Forum postponed its annual confab in Davos, Switzerland, which was set to take place this month. So is it safe to hold live in-person events again? Omicron cases appear to be less severe than cases from previous variants, and vaccines and new treatments are becoming available. More governments are also edging toward managing, not containing, the coronavirus, and are increasingly reluctant to reimpose restrictions. That could mean that a return to regular mass gatherings in some places may not be far-off. In hospitals around the country, doctors are taking notice: This wave of Covid seems different from the last one. Once again, as they face the highly contagious Omicron variant, medical personnel are exhausted and are contracting the virus themselves. And the numbers of patients entering hospitals with the variant are surging to staggering levels, filling up badly needed beds, delaying nonemergency procedures and increasing the risk that vulnerable uninfected patients will catch the virus. But in Omicron hot spots from New York to Florida to Texas, a smaller proportion of those patients are landing in intensive care units or requiring mechanical ventilation, doctors said. And many — roughly 50 to 65 percent of admissions in some New York hospitals — show up at the hospital for other ailments and then test positive for the virus. “We are seeing an increase in the number of hospitalizations,” said Dr. Rahul Sharma, emergency physician in chief for NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital. But the severity of the disease looks different from previous waves, he said. “We’re not sending as many patients to the I.C.U., we’re not intubating as many patients, and actually, most of our patients that are coming to the emergency department that do test positive are actually being discharged.” Though it’s still early for firm predictions, the shift in hospital patterns fits with emerging data that Omicron may be a variant with inherently milder effects than those that have come before, less prone to infecting the lungs, where it can cause serious disease. But the lower proportion of severe cases is also happening because, compared with previous variants, Omicron is infecting more people who have some prior immunity, whether through prior infection or vaccination. The vast majority of Omicron patients in I.C.U.s are unvaccinated or have severely compromised immune systems, doctors said. Hospitals, facing staff shortages, are under enormous strain. In New York City, hospitalizations have exceeded the peak of last winter’s surge. And Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, noting that the state had more hospitalized Covid-19 patients at that time than at any previous point during the pandemic. “We’re in truly crushed mode,” said Dr. Gabe Kelen, director of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s emergency department. The number of I.C.U. patients is a lagging indicator, likely to rise in the coming weeks, experts said. What’s more, some states are still struggling under the crush of hospitalizations from Delta, a previous version of the virus that may be more virulent. (Hospitals are frequently in the dark about which variant newly admitted patients are infected with.) NEW DELHI — When the Omicron coronavirus variant spread through India late in December, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged the nation to be vigilant and follow medical guidelines. Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of the capital region of Delhi, swiftly introduced night curfews, shut down movie theaters, and slashed restaurants and public transport to half capacity. Then, both men hit the campaign trail, often appearing without masks in packed rallies of thousands. “When it is our bread and butter at stake, they force restrictions and lockdowns,” said Ajay Tiwari, a 41-year-old taxi driver in New Delhi. “There are much bigger crowds at political rallies, but they don’t impose any lockdown in those areas. It really pains us deep in the heart.” As Omicron fuels a rapid spread of new infections through India’s major urban hubs, the country’s pandemic fatigue has been intensified by a sense of déjà vu and the frustration of mixed signals. It has been just a few months since the deadly Delta variant ravaged the country, when government leaders vastly underestimated its threat and publicly flouted their own advice. The memories of overwhelmed hospitals and funeral pyres working around the clock are still all too fresh here. The metropolis of Mumbai on Wednesday reported more than 15,000 new infections in 24 hours — the highest daily caseload since the pandemic began, beating the city’s previous record of about 11,000 cases during the second wave in the spring. In New Delhi, the number of daily infections increased by nearly 100 percent overnight. The sheer size of India’s population, at 1.4 billion, has always kept experts wary about the prospects of a new coronavirus variant. In few places around world was the toll of Delta as stark as in India. The country’s official figures show about half a million pandemic deaths — a number that experts say vastly undercounts the real toll. WASHINGTON — President Biden came into office vowing to restore public trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after the Trump White House had tied the agency’s hands and manipulated its scientific judgments on the pandemic for political ends. Yet in his first year, Mr. Biden has presided over a series of messaging failures that have followed a familiar pattern, with the agency’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, and her team making what experts say are largely sound decisions, but fumbling in communicating them to America. Dr. Walensky, a highly regarded infectious disease expert from Boston with no prior government experience, insisted in February that schools must keep students six feet apart; in March, she said three feet was enough. She said in February that teachers did not need to be vaccinated to reopen schools; the White House said the next day that she was speaking “in her personal capacity.” In May, she said that vaccinated people generally did not need to wear masks in public, a sudden change that flummoxed state health officials. Two months later, she reversed that guidance after it was shown that vaccinated people could still transmit the coronavirus. More recently, with the Omicron variant driving a near vertical rise in cases, Dr. Walensky alerted the White House that she planned to recommend that people infected with the virus isolate for five days instead of 10. To avoid another messaging fiasco, she briefed other top Biden health officials on her proposal so they would all be on the same page, according to two people familiar with her actions. But both Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, and Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, the surgeon general, took issue on national television with the agency’s policy of not requiring a negative Covid test before ending the shorter isolation. Dr. Tom Frieden, the agency’s director under President Barack Obama, said he did not believe the latest recommendations on isolation were significantly wrong, but “the way they were released was very problematic.” The crux of the problem, several administration officials said, is a failure by the C.D.C. and the Biden administration’s messaging experts to work in concert. Dr. Walensky’s critics say she is not collaborative enough, too often springing decisions on other federal officials who then struggle to defend them in public. Her defenders say that she strives to coordinate, but that it is not her job to ensure consensus across the entire administration. Some suggest the White House has gone too far in its hands-off, let-the-scientists-rule approach, leaving a vacuum of leadership and forcing ad hoc coordination between the various public health agencies. On the day President Biden was inaugurated, the advisory board of health experts who counseled him during his transition officially ceased to exist. But its members have quietly continued to meet regularly over Zoom, their conversations often turning to frustration with Mr. Biden’s coronavirus response. Now, six of these former advisers have gone public with an extraordinary, albeit polite, critique — and a plea to be heard. In three opinion articles published on Thursday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, they called for Mr. Biden to adopt an entirely new domestic pandemic strategy geared to the “new normal” of living with the virus indefinitely, not to wiping it out. The authors are all big names in American medicine. Several, including Dr. Luciana Borio, a former acting chief scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, and Dr. David Michaels, a former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration now with George Washington University’s School of Public Health, have held high-ranking government positions. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist, medical ethicist and University of Pennsylvania professor who advised former President Barack Obama, organized the effort. Like any White House, Mr. Biden’s prizes loyalty and prefers to keep its differences in house; in that regard, the articles are an unusual step. The authors say they wrote them partly because they have not made headway talking directly to White House officials. “From a macroperspective, it feels like we are always fighting yesterday’s crisis and not necessarily thinking what needs to be done today to prepare us for what comes next,” Dr. Borio said. The authors shared the articles with White House officials before they were published, but it was unclear whether the administration would adopt any of their suggestions. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, Mr. Biden’s top medical adviser for the pandemic, declined to comment on the articles. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters she had not read the articles, and dismissed a question about whether the president “is coming around to accepting” that Covid-19 is here to stay, even though several recent media accounts suggested that the administration was beginning to operate under that assumption. Mr. Biden’s recent emphasis on keeping schools open and businesses running even when cases are soaring also suggests a recalibration, as does a recent decision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend that people with Covid isolate for five days instead of 10."
43,The New York Times,nytimes,"As the Omicron variant continues to spread, many more people will contract Covid-19.",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3mYEgpJ%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR27i2xKxhglQ3IbI-w09YLnzzNzQaTZe6YOE1n3TewhTLMT8s4MXagpA0M&h=AT3AMSyTmxa4d5n_x4_TCqV2MAh1NVrvwBTmhYjva99Oxcuz2jJuISpC1BRwiRkPyek8Najb-q5GOyu50cqWL5vZmx5_7mjcJzxrPLCwulPFKpc63qXs7VIMOpidwafIG2ISuV-10Og_Y6A97onF&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT1ulPkTZgQJVMOufCF2O-wbLalW3NaFHYXxO5qu-QwjtlFGF_wf4dOtjsAwf0jxDQ4tCYE22WaUWHp6aGNJINeTBHvOykZg9Mce17Vf7bBvPiDRDnhKOovlX4z2eyIw-ITnsq8Y31vOk758-D3yMFmqzI98XUUWrOKKG2AzwjNdMGE4,1d,"During his successful campaign for mayor of New York City, Eric Adams made his top priority clear: tackling the rise in gun violence that began early in the pandemic. But the path that Mayor Adams has charted to reduce shootings centers on reinstating a version of the plainclothes police units that had become notorious for their use of force on Black and Latino New Yorkers before the units were disbanded in 2020. The proposal to restore what were known as anti-crime units has been roundly criticized by progressive groups, and underscores the tensions Mr. Adams is facing over policing issues in his first days in office. Mr. Adams, a former police captain who was at times an outspoken critic of the department from within, helped lead the backlash against the units after officers killed an unarmed Black man, Amadou Diallo, on his porch in 1999. The units were widely viewed within the department as an elite force that produced strong results. But they played an outsize role in the searches of millions of young Black and Latino men across the height of the stop-and-frisk era. And studies suggest the practice — which very rarely produced weapons — did little to actually lower crime levels. To some, Mr. Adams’s history makes him uniquely qualified to rebuild the unit responsibly. But others worry that he has forgotten lessons of the past, and say that an intense focus on gun enforcement has historically led to aggressive and discriminatory policing. The way Mr. Adams navigates the reinstatement of the unit will offer an early window into how his administration may tackle some of the most critical questions the Police Department faces. “What we have here is an opportunity to focus not on what uniform is an officer wearing or the name of the unit they’re in,” said Corey Stoughton, a lawyer who leads the special litigation unit of the Legal Aid Society. “But what are they doing? And how is that affecting New Yorkers — and in particular Black and brown New Yorkers — who bore the brunt of aggressive and violent policing activity over the years?” The push to recreate an anti-crime unit arrives amid a pitched national debate over police practices, and follows a rise in gun violence in New York. After reaching historic lows in 2018 and 2019, shootings increased dramatically in 2020 as the pandemic raged. While they have leveled off in recent months, they have remained higher than prepandemic levels. In New York and around the country, police departments have used plainclothes units to attempt to tackle illegal guns and drugs. But the units have often faced concerns over their conduct. The police commissioner in Baltimore dissolved plainclothes teams in 2017 after members of a gun task force were accused of extorting civilians and stealing their belongings. New York was one of the first cities to experiment decades ago with deploying police officers without uniforms. But the anti-crime units that operated out of the department’s 77 precincts and nine housing commands were disbanded in the summer of 2020. The police commissioner at the time, Dermot F. Shea, said they had become obsolete, and pitted officers against the people they served. Mr. Adams and his new police commissioner, Keechant Sewell, disagree. The two have said that they will rebrand the team as an “anti-gun unit” that wears body cameras and targets illegal firearms and gang activity. Several questions about the size and scope of the planned unit remain unanswered. But Mr. Adams and Ms. Sewell say that discriminatory arrests and brutal tactics will be avoided by selecting officers with appropriate temperaments and preparing them for the job. “I know how to do it right because I fought against what was being done wrong,” Mr. Adams said at a news conference on Sunday. “I’m responding to what I promised New Yorkers, and I have a police commissioner that understands how to do this correctly.” Still, the city currently is in a position that experts say has spurred trouble with the units in the past, as officials look for short-term solutions to address elevated public concerns about gun violence. When violent crime rose in the 1990s, officials tripled the ranks of what was then called the Street Crime Unit, and eased the intensive screening process needed to join. Admission to the unit began to center increasingly on internal relationships and arrest metrics, experts said. The consequences were severe: Four officers who joined the unit after those changes shot Mr. Diallo, a West African immigrant, 41 times after mistaking his wallet for a gun. The case in the Bronx spurred waves of protest and outrage. Mr. Adams has said that he would rely on a new cast of officers who would receive better supervision and intensive training that focuses on improving how they interact with residents. Evan Thies, a spokesman for Mr. Adams, did not make him available for an interview. In a statement, Mr. Thies said that the changes to the unit would ensure officers “get guns off the street without violating civil rights or putting the public at risk.” The department made more than 4,000 gun arrests last year, according to its data, one of the highest totals in recent years. The plan has been welcomed by some who see a need for rapid action to tackle gun violence — and view training as an essential piece of the plan’s success. “I’m happy to hear that Eric Adams is using this phrase, ‘emotional intelligence,’” said Maria Haberfeld, a professor of police science at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. “This is what we need to have better police officers.” Others say the approach falls short, and that calls for more training often create a cycle that boosts police budgets but does not produce results. “It really doesn’t translate even to the short-term safety of my community, even if it may feel that way to communities outside of mine,” said Monifa Bandele, who works with the Communities United for Police Reform Action Fund, an advocacy group. “We want Eric Adams to do what we demanded when we took to the streets back in June here and across the country,” she said. “We want to reimagine public safety.” The specter of the past also lingers for some who bore the brunt of previous enforcement, including David Ourlicht, one of the plaintiffs in the landmark class-action lawsuit that led a judge to declare the Police Department’s stop-and-frisk tactics unconstitutional in 2013. The strategy was heavily relied on under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and officials credited the practice — in which officers stopped, questioned and often searched people on the street — with reducing violence across the city. But in some years, Black and Latino New Yorkers were nine times more likely to be stopped than white residents, and several studies later disputed the tactic’s effectiveness. Other research has shown people who were stopped by the police often were more likely to face negative mental health consequences, including trauma and anxiety. Mr. Ourlicht, who recently settled a separate case against the city for $10,000 after he successfully argued he was again wrongly frisked, said he was frightened by the current discussions around policing and feared a return of aggressive encounters with officers. “Every day I walk outside of my house, I go over plans of how to keep myself safe,” Mr. Ourlicht said. “A long time ago, I came to the conclusion that this is going to be a major part of my life for the rest of my life.” And some experts say that the units, viewed within the department as one of the clearest paths to career advancement, incentivized officers to prioritize arrests at all costs. Mr. Adams has said often that he would not ignore misconduct in the department. “We have their backs,” Mr. Adams said at a news conference on Saturday. “But we are also going to hold them to a high standard. We are not allowing abusive officers to remain among our ranks.” The previous units were responsible for a disproportionate number of fatal shootings, including some of the city’s high-profile cases. One was the killing of Saheed Vassell. Anti-crime officers in the Crown Heights area of Brooklyn fatally shot the 34-year-old, who was mentally ill, in 2018 after he pointed a metal pipe toward them as if it were a gun. “It’s still a nightmare,” said Eric Vassell, his father. “We go to our bed with our son on our mind and wake up in the morning the same way. Thinking about that day, it will always haunt us.” The New York State attorney general did not find evidence to indict the officers or that their actions were unjustified. Most are still on the force. But the case spurred questions about the scope of the units. Residents argued that the killing of Mr. Vassell could have been avoided had patrol officers who were familiar with him and the neighborhood responded to the 911 calls instead. The killing and its aftermath were reflective of what many residents and experts say remains one of the most enduring effects of the units: The damage to public trust and the deep wounds in communities that have yet to heal. As Mr. Adams carries out his vision for the revamped anti-crime unit and policing broadly, many said that repairing those relationships will be among the most significant challenges. “If tomorrow, Eric Adams was simply to let anti-crime units out there, he would be taking a page out of what we used to do,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. “You have to build public trust before you simply unleash. It really has to be strategic. And it really has to be backed by the community.”"

But an encouraging new study suggests that our muscles remember. The study involved mice, but it builds on similar experiments with weight training and people. It found that muscles developed a pervasive and lasting molecular “memory” of past resistance exercises that helped them bounce back quickly from long layoffs. In the study, animals that completed a rodent form of resistance training developed changes in their muscles’ DNA that lingered long after they stopped exercising. The mice then packed on muscle mass much faster than other animals when they began training again. And as an encouraging side note to those who are taking up weight training for the first time, the findings also suggest that we should be able to build new muscle memories, regardless of our age. Until recently, the term “muscle memory” usually described our ability to bike, ski, throw to first base or repeat other common physical tasks, even if we had not pedaled, schussed or beelined a baseball in years. Our bodies remember how. But this type of memory, while real, is not really a muscle memory. These memories exist within motor neurons in our brains. But scientists knew that something happened within muscles themselves when they were worked hard, especially during weight training, and that these changes affected how muscles later responded to exercise. “Anecdotally, people say things like, ‘I used to be an athlete, then took time off, but my muscles came back as soon as I started’” lifting weights again, said Kevin Murach, a professor of health and human performance at the University of Arkansas, who oversaw the new study. Those stories piqued his and other researchers’ interest. How, they wondered, do muscles “remember” past workouts? And in what ways do those memories help muscles rebound after time away from the gym? Some preliminary studies with animals suggested that genes inside the nuclei of muscle cells worked differently after resistance exercises. Then, in 2018 and 2019, several much-discussed studies of people looked into the epigenetics of resistance training. Epigenetics refers to changes in the ways that genes operate, even though the gene itself does not change. It mostly involves a process called methylation, in which clusters of atoms, called methyl groups, attach themselves to the outside of genes like minuscule barnacles, making the genes more or less likely to turn on and produce particular proteins. In the recent human experiments, resistance exercise changed methylation patterns on a number of genes in people’s muscles, and those changes remained evident weeks or months later, even after the volunteers stopped exercising and lost some of their muscle mass. When they began lifting again, they packed muscle back on much faster than when the studies started, the researchers found. In essence, their muscles remembered how to grow. But those studies, while intriguing, lasted a few months at most. It was still unclear if exercise from much longer ago would linger as a genetic memory in our muscles, or just how many different cells and genes in muscles would be affected epigenetically by resistance training. So for the new study, which was published recently in Function, a flagship journal of the American Physiological Society, Dr. Murach and his colleagues, including the lead author Yuan Wen of the University of Kentucky, decided to recreate the human weight-training experiments as closely as possible in adult mice. Rodents’ life spans are far more condensed compared with ours, meaning that changes seen in the animals after several months might appear in people after several years. But since mice cannot use barbells, the scientists had them run on weighted running wheels, which were designed to provide leg-muscle resistance training. The animals trained for eight weeks and then sat in their cages for 12 weeks — about 10 percent of their life spans, which would be years for us. The animals then trained again for a month, joined by mice of the same age that were new to the exercise and that served as controls. Throughout, the researchers biopsied and microscopically studied their muscles. They noted plenty of differences in gene methylation in muscle cells after the mice trained; most of the changes remained months after they stopped exercising. In general, these epigenetic changes dialed up the operation of genes involved in muscle growth while quieting gene activity elsewhere, making the genetic process of building muscle “more refined,” Dr. Murach said. Even after months of inactivity, these changes helped the trained mice add more muscle more quickly during retraining, compared with the mice that had not previously trained. Of course, this study involved mice, not people. It also looked only at resistance exercises and not at aerobic workouts. But since many of the genes the researchers tracked are the same ones that researchers studied in the human experiments, the findings most likely have relevance for any of us who hope to build up our muscles in 2022. They suggest that:"

On Thursday, he was told he would need to leave the country, following a 10-hour standoff with government officials at a Melbourne airport, where he was held in a room overnight over the validity of his visa and questions about the evidence supporting a medical exemption from a coronavirus vaccine. The exemption was supposed to allow Djokovic, a 20-time Grand Slam tournament champion and one of the biggest stars in sports, to compete in the Australian Open even though he has not been vaccinated. Djokovic did not immediately leave the country, and his team filed a legal challenge to the ruling on Thursday. A judge said Djokovic would be allowed to remain in Australia at least until Monday as his lawyers awaited a hearing.  A spokesman for the tennis star did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Hours later, fans waving Serbian flags gathered outside the Melbourne hotel where Djokovic was believed to be staying to protest the decision to reject his visa. The chain of events represented a startling turnabout for Djokovic, who in a little more than 24 hours went from receiving special, last-minute permission to play in the Open, to boarding an intercontinental flight, to essentially being told by the prime minister of Australia that he was not welcome in the country. At one point President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia even got involved, speaking with Djokovic and criticizing the Australian government for its treatment of his country’s biggest sports star. The pandemic has wreaked all manner of havoc with sports during the past two years. The Tokyo Summer Olympics were postponed for a year. Major events took place in empty stadiums. Star players have been sent into isolation just ahead of their competitions after testing positive for the virus. The situation involving Djokovic, one of the most polarizing figures in tennis, was a match for any of them. It turned on a confrontation between a sports superstar and the most powerful leader in one of the world’s most prosperous countries, where government officials, citizens, the media and even some fellow players criticized the exemption, seemingly prompting the sudden shift. The decision promises to become another flashpoint in the debate about vaccines and how the pandemic should be managed now, especially in Australia, where egalitarianism is considered a sacred principle — and where “the tennis,” as the Open is called, is also beloved by what often seems like an entire nation of sports fanatics. In a statement Thursday, the Australian Border Force pledged to “continue to ensure that those who arrive at our border comply with our laws and entry requirements. The ABF can confirm that Mr. Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia, and his visa has been subsequently canceled.” For Djokovic, it was the latest and arguably the most wrenching controversy in a career that has been filled with them, nearly all of which have been brought on by the behavior of a champion who can be as willful and unbending off the court as he is on it. Djokovic has never been shy about expressing his nontraditional views of science and medicine (he once voiced support for the idea that prayer and belief could purify toxic water), and he has stated on multiple occasions his opposition to vaccine mandates, saying vaccination is a private and personal decision. However, he had not revealed until this week whether he had been vaccinated. On Tuesday, he announced on Twitter that he had received a medical exemption from the requirement that all people entering Australia be vaccinated or quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. He later boarded a plane bound for Australia from Dubai. In a statement later that day, Craig Tiley, the chief executive of Tennis Australia, explained that players seeking an exemption had to pass muster with two panels of medical experts. The process included the redaction of personal information to ensure privacy. “Fair and independent protocols were established for assessing medical exemption applications that will enable us to ensure Australian Open 2022 is safe and enjoyable for everyone,” Tiley said. “Central to this process was that the decisions were made by independent medical experts and that every applicant was given due consideration.” Tiley said Wednesday in a television interview that 26 players had applied for an exemption and “a handful” had been granted. According to Tiley, 99 percent of the more than 3,000 people coming to Australia for the tournament were vaccinated. The handful who were granted an exemption either had a medical condition or had Covid-19 during the past six months, though Australian health officials said late last year that a recent infection would not necessarily be enough to gain entry. Tennis Australia said Djokovic’s exemption was granted in part by an independent panel appointed by the Victoria Department of Health. Djokovic landed at Melbourne’s Tullamarine Airport around 11:30 p.m. on Wednesday. By then, he had become the central figure in a firestorm over how he had received permission to enter Australia, which is experiencing a startling rise in coronavirus cases. The country has waged one of the most successful battles against Covid-19, but it has come at a steep price. Strict lockdowns have lasted for months. International borders were largely closed until recently. Inbound travelers had to adhere to an expensive, two-week quarantine upon arrival. For long periods, even domestic travel between states was prohibited. The country has experienced about 2,200 deaths, but since opening its borders late last year it is now dealing with more than 30,000 cases a day. As Djokovic flew to Melbourne, Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, invoked the government’s authority to deny entry to Djokovic. “Any individual seeking to enter Australia must comply with our border requirements,” Morrison said. “We await his presentation and what evidence he provides us to support that,” Morrison added. “If that evidence is insufficient, then he won’t be treated any different to anyone else and he’ll be on the next plane home. There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic at all. None whatsoever.” Also Wednesday, Jaala Pulford, the acting sports minister for the state of Victoria, which contains Melbourne, site of the Open, said the state government would not support Djokovic’s application for a visa. Pulford wrote on Twitter that “visa approvals are a matter for the federal government.” Her statement followed the comments of Australia’s minister for home affairs, Karen Andrews, who noted the government had the authority to block Djokovic from entering the country. In a statement headlined “Australia’s Border Rules Apply to Everyone,” Andrews said that “while the Victorian Government and Tennis Australia may permit a non-vaccinated player to compete in the Australian Open, it is the Commonwealth Government that will enforce our requirements at the Australian border.” The decision to grant Djokovic a medical exemption from two panels of experts was greeted with skepticism and resignation from some of his fellow players, and outrage from Australians. “I think if it was me that wasn’t vaccinated I wouldn’t be getting an exemption,” Jamie Murray of Britain said on Tuesday. Others criticized the Australian government for bungling the process and mistreating the world’s top-ranked player. Tennys Sandgren, an American professional player who is also against a vaccination mandate, stated on Twitter that “Australia doesn’t deserve to host a Grand Slam.” Djokovic, who is tied with Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer for the most Grand Slam men’s singles titles with 20, would have been a favorite to win his 21st in Melbourne, where he has prevailed nine times. Melbourne has a small but energetic community of Serbian expatriates, who attend all of Djokovic’s matches at Rod Laver Arena, the Open’s main court, and provide him with rare enthusiastic support away from his homeland. While the men’s and women’s professional tours do not require a vaccination, tennis officials are at the mercy of the local, state and national governments in power where tournaments are held. It is possible that Djokovic could face these circumstances at other competitions if countries require a vaccine for entry or a local government requires one for work. The French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, which take place in late spring and summer, have yet to announce whether a vaccine will be required."

By shocking the nation with a vulgarity three months before presidential elections, Mr. Macron was relaying not only a public health message, but also a political one. He appeared to be calculating that tapping into the growing public anger against the unvaccinated held more potential electoral rewards than the risk of angering an anti-vaccination minority whose support he has little hope of ever getting. Using his harshest language yet to urge the recalcitrant to get their shots, Mr. Macron said he would not “throw them in prison” or “vaccinate them by force.” But he made it clear he meant to make their lives harder. In doing so, Mr. Macron, an inveterate political gambler who became the nation’s youngest elected leader five years ago, effectively kicked off his campaign for re-election Wednesday, drawing clear lines between his supporters and opponents. He also moved the focus of debate away from themes like immigration and Islam that have dominated the political race so far and that are advantageous to his strongest rivals, on the right and far right. Mr. Macron was clearly seeking to tap into a rich political vein that his counterparts have been more cautious to exploit: anger among the majority of vaccinated people at a minority who refuse to get vaccinated and disproportionately occupy hospital beds. More than 77 percent of French people, and 92 percent of those 12 and older, have received at least two doses, according to the government. “The unvaccinated, I really want to piss them off,” Mr. Macron said, using a French word that is more vulgar, explaining that a new, reinforced vaccine pass would make it impossible for the unvaccinated to go to restaurants and cafes, or the theater and cinemas. Their recalcitrance, as well as the surge in cases in France, is threatening to undermine his success so far in tackling the pandemic. Elsewhere in Europe — faced with the same dilemma that the pandemic might not be reined in until the unvaccinated change their minds — leaders have been more hesitant to confront groups opposed to vaccinations that are often well-organized and vocal. In Germany and Austria, the prospect of being coerced to get Covid shots has fueled angry and sometimes violent protests. Mandatory vaccination has long been dismissed as an option, not least by Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, but has increasingly gained support among politicians and virologists who say that other measures have failed to increase vaccination rates fast enough. In Germany, Mr. Scholz stressed that he was “chancellor of the unvaccinated, too.” But Germany has excluded unvaccinated people from much of public life and is now debating whether to make vaccination mandatory. Mandatory vaccination is also scheduled to come into effect next month in Austria. In Italy, the government is planning to introduce new measures to reduce the number of unvaccinated, possibly making shots mandatory for those over 60. But Italy’s large coalition government is struggling to find consensus on the measures, split between center-left groups that are in favor of mandatory vaccination and right-wing parties that are against it. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain has not applied significant pressure on the unvaccinated, instead preferring to try to persuade Britons to get shots. That is partly because a powerful faction within Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party opposes coronavirus restrictions on libertarian grounds, or worries about their economic impact. “Clearly, there are a number of leaders who don’t know anymore what to do,” said Adrien Abécassis, who has written about the politics of vaccination and is the head of research at Paris Peace Forum, an organization focusing on international governance. By contrast, in France, Mr. Macron has steadfastly stuck to a policy of vaccinating as many people as possible, Mr. Abécassis said, “So there is strong legitimacy in having the highest possible vaccination rate. The strategy from the start has been to impose social sanctions of exclusion to those who don’t respect the social norm, which is to get vaccinated.” Mr. Macron’s comments were published before France again registered a record number of infections on Wednesday evening — 332,000 cases — in the previous 24 hours, as the highly contagious Omicron variant sweeps across the country and the rest of Europe. The president was also reacting to moves this week by opposition lawmakers to delay the passage in Parliament of a bill that would make it possible to obtain France’s health pass only through vaccination and no longer with a negative test. The rapid spread of Omicron has strained Mr. Macron’s successful pandemic strategy and an underlying unwritten social contract between the government and the people. In return for agreeing to get vaccinated, the government has offered the French a near-normal life since last summer, with few of the more serious restrictions that France’s neighbors have reimposed. Nearly 92 percent of French people 12 years old and over have now received at least two doses, an unexpected feat in a country that had been one of the most suspicious of vaccines just a year ago, according to polls. Mr. Macron’s bet last summer on the twin powers of vaccines and health passports proved popular and contributed to his positive approval rating — about 40 percent, a high level compared to those of his predecessors in the same period before their own bids for re-election. But about five million French, including four million adults, have yet to get a single shot. Mr. Macron’s use of a vulgar expression was clearly meant to tap into the growing anger by the overwhelming majority of vaccinated people against the unvaccinated minority, said Stewart Chau, an analyst for the polling firm Viavoice and a sociologist. “Creating divisions around the issue of the pandemic is what the president of the republic tried to do by saying out loud what others are thinking quietly,” Mr. Chau said, adding that the word would speak to a “public opinion that, after two years of a health crisis, is worn-out and exhausted” as well as more “irritable and emotional.” The president’s rivals attacked his use of the vulgarity as “unworthy of a president,” “shocking” and “divisive.” Gabriel Attal, the government spokesman, pushed back, saying that the president’s choice of language represented only a fraction of “the anger of the great majority of French people confronted with the choice to oppose vaccination.” “Let’s speak frankly — who pisses off whom?” Mr. Attal said, adding that it was those “who refuse to be vaccinated” who are “ruining the lives” of health care workers, the elderly, and those working in theaters, restaurants and other businesses. Mr. Macron studiously used the word “emmerder,” which is translated literally as “to mire in excrement” and means to “annoy” or “to give a hard time to.” Technically, Mr. Macron has yet to officially declare his candidacy for the election in April. For months, Mr. Macron has been coyly deflecting questions about his candidacy. Last month, during a long television interview, Mr. Macron said he regretted harsh words he had used in the past on other issues — and which had helped create an image of him as an elitist politician disconnected from the people. In a speech, he had once divided people into two categories: “Those who succeed and those who are nothing.” Mr. Chau, the pollster, said that Mr. Macron’s use of crude slang would probably not weaken his core support. But it could alienate the undecided by reviving Mr. Macron’s image of arrogance. “It’s the overriding character trait of Emmanuel Macron that he’s never been able to shake off,” Mr. Chau said. Mr. Macron used the crude slang — not once, but three times — in a reply to a reader of the daily newspaper “Le Parisien.” In interviews organized at the Élysée Palace, Mr. Macron replied to various questions, including to a woman who pointed out that the unvaccinated occupied most of the beds in intensive care units and prevented others, including cancer patients, from getting the care they needed. Mr. Macron said the unvaccinated were a rebellious minority whose numbers he planned to shrink by “pissing them off.” “In democracy, the worst enemies are lies and stupidity,” he said. Mr. Macron appeared to be hewing to a strategy — expressed by his allies in recent months — of portraying himself as the candidate of “reason” and solidifying his hold on the center. His words also targeted a segment of the electorate that is unlikely to vote for him, as evidenced by the strongest reaction to his choice of language, especially from the extreme left and the extreme right. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the far-left leader, accused Mr. Macron of promoting “collective punishment against individual freedom.” Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader and one of Mr. Macron’s main rivals, accused him of “waging war” on the unvaccinated. Eric Zemmour, the far-right TV pundit and another leading competitor, said Mr. Macron’s words revealed his cruelty toward a class of “despised French.”"

The remarks by Jeff Zients, who leads the White House pandemic response, come two weeks after Mr. Biden said his administration would buy half a billion rapid tests to distribute free to the public, and that insurance companies would begin reimbursing people for tests they purchased on their own. Mr. Biden said at the time that the free tests would be available “in the coming weeks.” With the Omicron variant of the coronavirus fueling a sharp rise in cases across the country, demand for all kinds of tests is far outpacing supply. In some areas, people are waiting in long lines to take the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., tests that are administered at medical clinics. Rapid at-home tests are flying off pharmacy shelves. “We know this remains frustrating for people getting tested in many parts of the country,” Mr. Zients said on Wednesday. “So we are working to do all we can.” The administration’s new “test to stay” guidance for schools, in which students exposed to the virus can remain in the classroom if they test negative, is among the factors driving up demand for the rapid tests. Last week, when Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, omitted a testing requirement from new isolation guidelines, she was greeted with a chorus of criticism from public health experts who said a negative test should be required before an infected person ends a five-day isolation period. On Tuesday, the C.D.C. amended the latest guidance — not to say that testing was required, but to say that people who wanted to end their isolation periods after five days and had access to tests may choose to take them. If the test results are positive, they should stay home for another five days, the guidance says; if negative, and their symptoms are resolving, they may go out, but should continue to wear masks in public for another five days. Addressing reporters on Wednesday, Dr. Walensky said she omitted a testing requirement from the guidance because rapid tests are not authorized by the Food and Drug Administration to determine whether someone is infectious to others; they are authorized merely to detect infection, and are meant to be used serially, as is the case in schools. But after the guidance was released, she said, “it became very clear that people were interested in using the rapid tests,” and since that was the case, she at least wanted to “provide guidance on how they should be used.” The recommendation for the general public is different from the one for health care workers, who are required to test negative before going back to work. Dr. Walensky said the C.D.C. was always more conservative in its recommendations for health workers, because they care for vulnerable people, including those with weak immune systems. Matching testing supply with demand has been a challenge for both the Trump and Biden administrations. Early in the pandemic, there was a shortage of tests and the components that make up test kits. By late 2020, manufacturers had expanded production. But once vaccines arrived, the Biden administration put less emphasis on testing. Demand plunged, and manufacturers pulled back. Now the manufacturers are running at full speed again. Mr. Zients said manufacturers would begin delivering rapid tests kits to the federal government next week, and that the administration would set up a “free and easy system, including a website” where Americans could order them. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Wednesday that new federal testing sites would open this week in the District of Columbia and Philadelphia, followed soon after by Maine, Maryland, Nevada, Delaware, Texas and Washington state. She noted that mobile testing sites were already open in New York City and New Jersey."

Starting Friday, vaccinated travelers will no longer need to take a test before their journey, Mr. Johnson said in a statement to Parliament on Wednesday. They will still need to take one within two days of arrival, he said, though a rapid antigen test is enough. As of Sunday, the government will not require a more expensive P.C.R. test. The changes were welcomed by the country’s hard-hit aviation industry. Mr. Johnson defended the stricter travel restrictions that were put in place in late November, when the Omicron variant was first identified, as necessary to slow its arrival. “But now,” he said, “Omicron is so prevalent, these measures are having limited impact on the growth in cases, while continuing to pose significant costs on our travel industry.” The decision announced Wednesday effectively takes Britain back to the same rules it operated in October. But unvaccinated passengers will still be required to take a pre-departure test and to self-isolate on arrival for 10 days, during which time they must take two P.C.R. tests. There were 194,747 daily cases recorded in the United Kingdom, according to data released on Wednesday, near the record of 218,724 cases announced on Tuesday. Mr. Johnson’s announcement covered England only, but Wales said it would take a similar step, and Scotland and Northern Ireland were expected to follow suit. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, an industry body, said the relaxed rules were a “hugely welcome move at a critical time in the booking season for passengers.” The change would, he said in a statement, “provide a massive boost to those wanting to travel abroad or come to the U.K. this year.” He added, “People will now be able to book knowing that, for the fully vaccinated, all emergency testing restrictions have been removed.”"

On Thursday, he was told he would need to leave the country, following a 10-hour standoff with government officials at a Melbourne airport, where he was held in a room overnight over the validity of his visa and questions about the evidence supporting a medical exemption from a coronavirus vaccine. The exemption was supposed to allow Djokovic, a 20-time Grand Slam tournament champion and one of the biggest stars in sports, to compete in the Australian Open even though he has not been vaccinated. Djokovic did not immediately leave the country, and his team filed a legal challenge to the ruling on Thursday. A judge said Djokovic would be allowed to remain in Australia at least until Monday as his lawyers awaited a hearing.  A spokesman for the tennis star did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Hours later, fans waving Serbian flags gathered outside the Melbourne hotel where Djokovic was believed to be staying to protest the decision to reject his visa. The chain of events represented a startling turnabout for Djokovic, who in a little more than 24 hours went from receiving special, last-minute permission to play in the Open, to boarding an intercontinental flight, to essentially being told by the prime minister of Australia that he was not welcome in the country. At one point President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia even got involved, speaking with Djokovic and criticizing the Australian government for its treatment of his country’s biggest sports star. The pandemic has wreaked all manner of havoc with sports during the past two years. The Tokyo Summer Olympics were postponed for a year. Major events took place in empty stadiums. Star players have been sent into isolation just ahead of their competitions after testing positive for the virus. The situation involving Djokovic, one of the most polarizing figures in tennis, was a match for any of them. It turned on a confrontation between a sports superstar and the most powerful leader in one of the world’s most prosperous countries, where government officials, citizens, the media and even some fellow players criticized the exemption, seemingly prompting the sudden shift. The decision promises to become another flashpoint in the debate about vaccines and how the pandemic should be managed now, especially in Australia, where egalitarianism is considered a sacred principle — and where “the tennis,” as the Open is called, is also beloved by what often seems like an entire nation of sports fanatics. In a statement Thursday, the Australian Border Force pledged to “continue to ensure that those who arrive at our border comply with our laws and entry requirements. The ABF can confirm that Mr. Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia, and his visa has been subsequently canceled.” For Djokovic, it was the latest and arguably the most wrenching controversy in a career that has been filled with them, nearly all of which have been brought on by the behavior of a champion who can be as willful and unbending off the court as he is on it. Djokovic has never been shy about expressing his nontraditional views of science and medicine (he once voiced support for the idea that prayer and belief could purify toxic water), and he has stated on multiple occasions his opposition to vaccine mandates, saying vaccination is a private and personal decision. However, he had not revealed until this week whether he had been vaccinated. On Tuesday, he announced on Twitter that he had received a medical exemption from the requirement that all people entering Australia be vaccinated or quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. He later boarded a plane bound for Australia from Dubai. In a statement later that day, Craig Tiley, the chief executive of Tennis Australia, explained that players seeking an exemption had to pass muster with two panels of medical experts. The process included the redaction of personal information to ensure privacy. “Fair and independent protocols were established for assessing medical exemption applications that will enable us to ensure Australian Open 2022 is safe and enjoyable for everyone,” Tiley said. “Central to this process was that the decisions were made by independent medical experts and that every applicant was given due consideration.” Tiley said Wednesday in a television interview that 26 players had applied for an exemption and “a handful” had been granted. According to Tiley, 99 percent of the more than 3,000 people coming to Australia for the tournament were vaccinated. The handful who were granted an exemption either had a medical condition or had Covid-19 during the past six months, though Australian health officials said late last year that a recent infection would not necessarily be enough to gain entry. Tennis Australia said Djokovic’s exemption was granted in part by an independent panel appointed by the Victoria Department of Health. Djokovic landed at Melbourne’s Tullamarine Airport around 11:30 p.m. on Wednesday. By then, he had become the central figure in a firestorm over how he had received permission to enter Australia, which is experiencing a startling rise in coronavirus cases. The country has waged one of the most successful battles against Covid-19, but it has come at a steep price. Strict lockdowns have lasted for months. International borders were largely closed until recently. Inbound travelers had to adhere to an expensive, two-week quarantine upon arrival. For long periods, even domestic travel between states was prohibited. The country has experienced about 2,200 deaths, but since opening its borders late last year it is now dealing with more than 30,000 cases a day. As Djokovic flew to Melbourne, Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, invoked the government’s authority to deny entry to Djokovic. “Any individual seeking to enter Australia must comply with our border requirements,” Morrison said. “We await his presentation and what evidence he provides us to support that,” Morrison added. “If that evidence is insufficient, then he won’t be treated any different to anyone else and he’ll be on the next plane home. There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic at all. None whatsoever.” Also Wednesday, Jaala Pulford, the acting sports minister for the state of Victoria, which contains Melbourne, site of the Open, said the state government would not support Djokovic’s application for a visa. Pulford wrote on Twitter that “visa approvals are a matter for the federal government.” Her statement followed the comments of Australia’s minister for home affairs, Karen Andrews, who noted the government had the authority to block Djokovic from entering the country. In a statement headlined “Australia’s Border Rules Apply to Everyone,” Andrews said that “while the Victorian Government and Tennis Australia may permit a non-vaccinated player to compete in the Australian Open, it is the Commonwealth Government that will enforce our requirements at the Australian border.” The decision to grant Djokovic a medical exemption from two panels of experts was greeted with skepticism and resignation from some of his fellow players, and outrage from Australians. “I think if it was me that wasn’t vaccinated I wouldn’t be getting an exemption,” Jamie Murray of Britain said on Tuesday. Others criticized the Australian government for bungling the process and mistreating the world’s top-ranked player. Tennys Sandgren, an American professional player who is also against a vaccination mandate, stated on Twitter that “Australia doesn’t deserve to host a Grand Slam.” Djokovic, who is tied with Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer for the most Grand Slam men’s singles titles with 20, would have been a favorite to win his 21st in Melbourne, where he has prevailed nine times. Melbourne has a small but energetic community of Serbian expatriates, who attend all of Djokovic’s matches at Rod Laver Arena, the Open’s main court, and provide him with rare enthusiastic support away from his homeland. While the men’s and women’s professional tours do not require a vaccination, tennis officials are at the mercy of the local, state and national governments in power where tournaments are held. It is possible that Djokovic could face these circumstances at other competitions if countries require a vaccine for entry or a local government requires one for work. The French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, which take place in late spring and summer, have yet to announce whether a vaccine will be required."

The 64th annual ceremony, which had been set for Jan. 31 in Los Angeles, will be rescheduled, according to a joint statement on Wednesday from the Recording Academy and CBS, as the Omicron variant has led to a surge in cases nationwide. The new date will be announced soon, the statement said, noting, “The health and safety of those in our music community, the live audience, and the hundreds of people who work tirelessly to produce our show remains our top priority.” Last year’s show was postponed by six weeks as cases spiked, and before vaccinations were widely available. Last week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, predicted that the latest wave of the pandemic may reach its peak in the United States by the end of January. This year the composer and bandleader Jon Batiste has 11 Grammy nominations, more than any other artist, and will compete for both album and record of the year. Other top nominees include Olivia Rodrigo, Justin Bieber, Billie Eilish and Doja Cat. No performers have been announced yet. In November, in an unusual move, the Recording Academy, the organization behind the awards, made a last-minute change to the nominations procedure. Just 24 hours before the nominations were announced, the group voted to expand the ballot in the top four categories — album, record and song of the year, and best new artist — to 10 spots, from eight, a move that benefited Taylor Swift, Kanye West, Lil Nas X and others. Two weeks later, Drake, who was nominated for two Grammys but has long expressed ambivalence about the awards, withdrew from the competition. This year, the Recording Academy had also scheduled the return of its high-profile annual pre-Grammy events, which take place in the days leading up to the show and feature stars mingling with music executives. A tribute to Joni Mitchell, benefiting MusiCares, a charity associated with the Grammys that helps musicians in need, was to feature performers like James Taylor, Herbie Hancock, Brandi Carlile and Batiste. Clive Davis, the 89-year-old music executive, also had plans to hold his annual gala the night before the ceremony. The Academy’s statement didn’t specify changes in plans for these events. The main ceremony has been scheduled for the Grammys’ usual home in downtown Los Angeles, which is now called Crypto.com Arena. (It was until late last month called the Staples Center.) Last year, performances and award presentations took place nearby, at the Los Angeles Convention Center, and largely outdoors. That show was hosted by Trevor Noah, who is returning this year. Reviews of the 2021 event — in which many artists faced each other on a stage built for multiple performances — praised it as a fresh new take. But ratings fell by 53 percent to 8.8 million, according to Nielsen, a new low for the Grammys."

52,The New York Times,nytimes,"Mayor Eric Adams of New York City wants to restore the NYPD's plainclothes anti-crime unit, which recovered illegal guns. But groups have criticized the move, saying a focus on gun enforcement has in the past disproportionately targeted young Black and Latino men.",https://nyti.ms/3FYFvwB?fbclid=IwAR1gwNZ2FXUcpQEgcfHQ34JUnhTri0gHrmw5Y-I-lPhNY2QU5KTr4cvjWDM,1d,"Each year, I look ahead at what’s new in consumer technology to guide you through what you might expect to buy — and what will most likely be a fad. Many of the same “trends” appear again and again because, to put it simply, technology takes a long time to mature before most of us actually want to buy it. That applies this year as well. Some trends for 2022 that tech companies are pushing are things you have heard of before. A chief example is virtual reality, the technology that involves wearing goofy-looking headgear and swinging around controllers to play 3-D games. That is expected to be front and center again this year, remarketed by the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and other techies as “the metaverse.” Another buzzy category will be the so-called smart home, the technology to control home appliances by shouting voice commands at a speaker or tapping a button on a smartphone. The truth is, the tech industry has tried to push this kind of technology into our homes for more than a decade. This year, these products may finally begin to feel practical to own. Another recurring technology on this list is digital health gear that tracks our fitness and helps us diagnose possible ailments. And automakers, which have long talked about electric cars, are beginning to accelerate their plans to meet a nationwide goal to phase out production of gas-powered cars by 2030. Here are four tech trends that will invade our lives this year. For more than a decade, technologists have dreamed of an era when our virtual lives play as important a role as our physical realities. In theory, we would spend lots of time interacting with our friends and colleagues in virtual space, and as a result we would spend money there, too, on outfits and objects for our digital avatars. “We’re in a world where people several times per day send out an image reflecting themselves,” said Matthew Ball, a venture capitalist who has written extensively about the metaverse. “The next phase takes that visual representation and dimensionalizes it. You go into an environment and express yourself through an avatar.” That sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie. But throughout Year 2 of the pandemic, a critical mass of factors came together to make the metaverse more realistic, Mr. Ball said. For one, the technology got better. Last year, Facebook announced that it had renamed itself Meta after shipping 10 million units of its virtual-reality headset, the Quest 2, which was a milestone. For another, many of us were willing to splurge on our digital selves. Hordes of investors bought NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, which are one-of-a-kind digital objects purchased with cryptocurrency. Eminem and other investors invested hundreds of thousands of dollars to join a virtual yacht club. There’s more to come this year. Apple plans to unveil its version of a virtual reality headset, which will look like a pair of ski goggles and, for computing power, rely on a separate computing device that is worn elsewhere on the body. Apple declined to comment. Google has also developed virtual reality products for years, and Microsoft has offered a virtual reality headset for businesses and government agencies. The metaverse could still turn out to be a fad, depending on what products emerge and who buys them. Carolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst for the consulting firm Creative Strategies, said she worried that it could become a reflection of the privileged few who can afford to treat their digital selves. “The boating market is dominated by white upper-class middle-aged men,” she said. “Will we just transfer all of that into the metaverse?” Over the last few years, smart home products like internet-connected thermostats, door locks and robotic vacuum cleaners made major progress. The devices became affordable and worked reliably with digital assistants like Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Apple’s Siri. Yet the smart home, for the most part, has remained chaotic. Many smart home products didn’t work well with other technology. Some door locks, for example, worked only with Apple phones and not Androids; some thermostats were controlled by talking to Google Assistant and not to Siri. The lack of compatibility has created long-term issues. An Apple-compatible lock isn’t useful for the family member or future tenant who prefers Android. It would also be more convenient one day if our home devices could actually talk to one another, like a washing machine telling a dryer that a large load was ready to be dried. This year, the tech industry’s biggest rivals — Apple, Samsung, Google and Amazon — are playing nice to make the smart home more practical. They plan to release and update home technology to work with Matter, a new standard that enables smart home devices to talk to one another regardless of the virtual assistant or phone brand. More than 100 smart home products are expected to adhere to the standard. “We’re all speaking a common language built on already proven technologies,” said Samantha Osborne, a vice president of marketing for SmartThings, the home automation company owned by Samsung. This means that later this year, when you shop for a product like an automated door lock, look for a label indicating that the device is compatible with Matter. Then, in the future, your smart alarm clock may be able to tell your smart lights to turn on when you wake up. Fitness gadgets like the Apple Watch and Fitbit, which help us track our movements and heart rate, keep getting more popular. So tech companies are experimenting this year with smaller wearable devices that gather more intimate data about our health. Oura, a health tech company, recently introduced a new model of its Oura Ring, which is embedded with sensors that track metrics including body temperature to accurately predict menstruation cycles. This week at CES, a tech trade show in Las Vegas, Movano, another health tech start-up, unveiled a similar ring that stitches together data about your heart rate, temperature and other measures to inform a wearer about potential chronic illnesses. Medical experts have long warned about the potential consequences of health tech. Without proper context, the data could potentially be used to misdiagnose illnesses and turn people into hypochondriacs. But if the widely sold-out Covid rapid test kits are any measure, more of us appear ready to be proactive in monitoring our health. Last year, President Biden announced an ambitious goal: Half of all vehicles sold in the United States would be electric rather than gas-powered by 2030. In response, major automakers are hyping their electric cars, including at CES this week. On Tuesday, Ford Motor announced plans to increase production of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck. Later this week, General Motors plans to unveil a battery-powered version of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. Other carmakers, like Mercedes-Benz, have shared plans for electric cars to be released in coming years. While there’s lots of marketing hype around electric cars, those of us looking for battery-powered vehicles this year will probably still gravitate toward Tesla, Ms. Milanesi said. That’s because we have yet to see widespread deployment of solar power and charging stations for electric cars, especially in more rural areas. Tesla has a head start because it has been rolling out charging stations for years, she said. “There’s so much from an infrastructure perspective that needs to happen,” she said. “So it’s a lot of talk, but I don’t know how much of a reality.”"

Read more in a note from Times Opinion’s politics editor Ezekiel Kweku in our Opinion Today newsletter. In December 1972, the critic Pauline Kael admitted that she’d been living in a political bubble. “I only know one person who voted for Nixon,” she said. “Where they are, I don’t know. They’re outside my ken.” A pithier version of her remark (“I can’t believe Nixon won. I don’t know anyone who voted for him.”) has been used to exemplify liberal insularity ever since, both by conservative pundits and by the kind of centrist journalists who have spent the past several years buzzing in the ears of heartland diner patrons, looking for clues about Donald Trump’s rise. The most important fact about the Trump era, though, can be gleaned simply by examining his vote tallies and approval ratings: At no point in his political career — not a single day — has Mr. Trump enjoyed the support of the majority of the country he governed for four years. And whatever else Jan. 6 might have been, it should be understood first and foremost as an expression of disbelief in — or at least a rejection of — that reality. Rather than accepting, in defeat, that much more of their country lay outside their ken than they’d known, his supporters proclaimed themselves victors and threw a deadly and historic tantrum. The riot was an attack on our institutions, and of course, inflammatory conservative rhetoric and social media bear some of the blame. But our institutions also helped produce that violent outburst by building a sense of entitlement to power within America’s conservative minority. The structural advantages that conservatives enjoy in our electoral system are well known. Twice already this young century, the Republican Party has won the Electoral College and thus the presidency while losing the popular vote. Republicans in the Senate haven’t represented a majority of Americans since the 1990s, yet they’ve controlled the chamber for roughly half of the past 20 years. In 2012 the party kept control of the House even though Democrats won more votes. And as is now painfully clear to Democratic voters, their party faces significant barriers to success in Washington even when it manages to secure full control of government: The supermajority requirement imposed by the Senate filibuster can stall even wildly popular legislation, and Republicans have so stacked the judiciary that the Supreme Court seems poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, an outcome that around 60 percent of the American people oppose, according to several recent polls. Obviously, none of the structural features of our federal system were designed with contemporary politics and the Republican Party in mind. But they are clearly giving a set of Americans who have taken strongly to conservative ideology — rural voters in sparsely populated states in the middle of the country — more power than the rest of the electorate. With these structural advantages in place, it’s not especially difficult to see how the right came to view dramatic political losses, when they do occur, as suspect. If the basic mechanics of the federal system were as fair and balanced as we’re taught they are, the extent and duration of conservative power would reflect the legitimate preferences of most Americans. Democratic victories, by contrast, now seem to the right like underhanded usurpations of the will of the majority — in President Biden’s case, by fraud and foreign voters, and in Barack Obama’s, by a candidate who was himself a foreign imposition on the true American people. But the federal system is neither fair nor balanced. Rather than democratic give and take between two parties that share the burden of winning over the other side, we have one favored party and another whose effortful victories against ever-lengthening odds are conspiratorially framed as the skulduggery of schemers who can win only through fraud and covert plans to import a new electorate. It doesn’t help that Republican advantages partly insulate the party from public reproach; demagogy is more likely to spread among politicians if there are few electoral consequences. This is a recipe for political violence. Jan. 6 wasn’t the first or the deadliest attack to stem from the idea that Democrats are working to force their will on a nonexistent conservative political and cultural majority. We have no reason to expect it will be the last. And while much of the language Republican politicians and commentators use to incite their base seems outwardly extreme, it’s important to remember that what was done on Jan. 6 was done in the name of the Constitution, as most Republican voters now understand it — as an eternal compact that keeps power in their rightful hands. Tellingly, during his Jan. 6 rally, Mr. Trump cannily deployed some of the language Democrats have used to denounce voting restrictions and foreign interference. “Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy,” he said. “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard. Today we will see whether Republicans stand strong for the integrity of our elections.” The mainstream press has also had a hand in inflating the right’s sense of itself. Habits like the misrepresentation of Republican voters and operatives as swing voters plucked off the street and the constant, reductive blather about political homogeneity on the coasts — even though there were more Trump voters in New York City in 2016 and 2020 than there were in both Dakotas combined — create distorted impressions of our political landscape. The tendency of journalists to measure the wisdom of policies and rhetoric based on their distance from the preferences of conservative voters only reinforces the idea that it’s fair for politicians, activists and voters on the left to take the reddest parts of the country into account without the right taking a reciprocal interest in what most Americans want. That premise still dominates and constrains strategic thinking within the Democratic Party. A year after the Capitol attack and all the rent garments and tears about the right’s radicalism and the democratic process, the party has failed to deliver promised political reforms, thanks to opposition from pivotal members of its own Senate caucus — Democrats who argue that significantly changing our system would alienate Republicans. Given demographic trends, power in Washington will likely continue accruing to Republicans even if the right doesn’t undertake further efforts to subvert our elections. And to fix the structural biases at work, Democrats would have to either attempt the impossible task of securing broad, bipartisan support for major new amendments to the Constitution — which, it should be said, essentially bars changes to the Senate’s basic design — or pass a set of system-rebalancing workarounds, such as admitting new states ⁠like the District of Columbia. It should never be forgotten that fully enfranchised voters from around the country gathered to stage a riot over their supposedly threatened political rights last January in a city of 700,000 people who don’t have a full vote in Congress. Jan. 6 demonstrated that the choice the country now faces isn’t one between disruptive changes to our political system and a peaceable status quo. To assume that choice is to indulge the other big lie that drew violence to the Capitol in the first place. The notion that the 18th-century American constitutional order is suited to governance in the 21st is as preposterous and dangerous as anything Mr. Trump has ever uttered. It was the supposedly stabilizing features of our vaunted system that made him president to begin with and incubated the extremism that turned his departure into a crisis."
54,The New York Times,nytimes,Breaking News: Novak Djokovic was refused entry to Australia and asked to leave the country after a 12-hour airport standoff over the validity of his visa and questions about his vaccine medical exemption for the Australian Open.,https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3n0pdeX%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3lw9rfJp5cNC7hFLTeZNWKteHoutiK4R2JgGToWRzcdvVfVPRAokTqxVw&h=AT0nVSSQ4HX4Tu_SANQueiZcTOPjEjHTp4kEusV5vrkhjUjP-3kf0a4iLGfmKrT3r_NNYdMiWYME-m6ZeYaNN1ygLJQfef8JzfFm26wTzOMp3c56O44NATpuyq772IMdZB8P0RhkUUh-EMdynqMF&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT1IBEsykf2LBh3mEWB08lXwWKOX5LzUucu_awbFALV-SH3WMCKX7s7i-7Y4yV0rAuaZK1kAY_uX4PtWXMSFiaDW7krf9MSHOytuDaC9-cezzzws4IhqYd-r9ZxVmCsyPUDuwJs_k49Q0Liy4Q7KB9qGCL7CBENxThtB1zDQhurYXLPy,1d,"When Dick Zigun set his sights on Coney Island in the late 1970s, the seaside section of Brooklyn was, like much of the rest of New York, at a low ebb. Yet he saw magic in the beach, boardwalk, rides and arcades that had long defined the area. “There’s something about the salt and the sea air that preserves the body and rots the mind, and creates the bohemian neighborhood I fell in love with the first day I visited,” he said in an interview last month. In the years since, Mr. Zigun, a tattooed, top hat-wearing spiritual heir to P.T. Barnum, has thrown himself into restoring the so-called People’s Playground to its carnivalesque glory, opening a circus sideshow and a museum and, perhaps most notably, creating the annual Mermaid Parade. Now, though, his four-decade reign as Coney Island’s unelected mayor is over: The nonprofit group he helped start to carry out his vision fired him amid a squabble over money. “How is your holiday going?” Mr. Zigun, 68, wrote in a Christmas Day message on Twitter in which he said the organization, Coney Island USA, had fired him effective Dec. 31, changed the locks on its doors, disabled his email account and deleted his profile page from its website. James Fitzsimmons, Coney Island USA’s executive director, disputed Mr. Zigun’s characterization of his departure, saying it was part of a planned transition that Mr. Zigun upended by demanding a pension. In an interview, Mr. Fitzsimmons said that despite having been offered a severance package for stepping down as the group’s artistic director, Mr. Zigun was “convinced that someone owes him a retirement or, you know, security for the rest of his life.” “It’s just not possible, and he’s known that for years,” Mr. Fitzsimmons added. Mr. Zigun says the severance offer was well short of what he deserved. “Coney Island is my baby,” he said, adding that he was showing Coney Island USA “tough love” the way a parent would a wayward child. “It’s not unusual for children to argue over the assets of their parents,” said Mr. Zigun. “It happens all the time in real life, and I think we’re getting a version of that here.” Mr. Fitzsimmons summed up the conflict this way: “Imagine a bunch of very smart art school people who have been very stoned for about 40 years who are now trying to argue over business.” (He included himself in the description.) The rupture comes during what Mr. Fitzsimmons said had been a “very horrible period” caused by the pandemic. The Mermaid Parade, which organizers call “the nation’s largest art parade” and which drew 800,000 people in 2019, went online in 2020. It was shelved entirely last summer, with Surf Avenue serving instead as a vaccination site after the Delta variant of the coronavirus emerged. As envisioned by Mr. Zigun and his collaborators, the parade, which began in 1983, was a throwback to Coney Island’s prime as a lure for artists and performers and a summer destination for a public smitten with Ferris wheels, fortune tellers and burlesque shows. The area first established itself as a populist carnival in the late 1800s and early 1900s, thanks to its early amusement parks — Dreamland, Luna and Steeplechase — being just a short ride away for the city’s hardworking hordes. Over time, Coney Island’s appeal faded. Luna Park closed in 1946, although the Cyclone and the Wonder Wheel still stood. In the 1950s, as television became more popular, the crowds melted away further. In the mid-1960s, Fred Trump, the former president’s father, took control of Steeplechase Park with plans to build luxury apartments. He staged a “funeral” where bikini-clad women passed out stones and invited “mourners” to hurl them at the park’s pavilion. The decline continued in the years that followed. “It was rough, it was burned out, a shell of what it used to be 20 to 30 years prior,” said Adam Rinn, who grew up in the area and is Mr. Zigun’s designated successor. (He declined to comment on the conflict between Mr. Zigun and the Coney Island USA board.) Still, some of the old allure remained, calling out to people like Mr. Rinn. He said he saw his first Coney Island show at 15. It featured Otis Jordan, “The World’s Only Human Cigarette Factory,” who rolled, lit and smoked a cigarette using only his lips. “It was such a surreal experience,” said Mr. Rinn, 50, who went to learn how to swallow swords, eat and spit fire, walk on glass, lie on a bed of nails and hammer nails into his face. (“I guess I’d be considered a quick learner,” he said.) Mr. Zigun links his own Coney Island infatuation in part to his roots in Barnum’s hometown, Bridgeport, Conn. Arriving in New York after earning a fine arts degree from Yale Drama School, he decided to look for something on the fringe. “When I finished my fancy education, instead of aspiring to Broadway or a place like La MaMa in the East Village, I had this wacky idea of starting my own theater in Coney Island,” he said. The Coney Island Circus Sideshow, which began two years after the Mermaid Parade, features a roster of little people, exceptionally hairy ones and performers like Mr. Rinn who eat fire and swallow swords. There is also a sideshow school that attracts students from across the United States and beyond. Those who have gotten to know Mr. Zigun, a sometimes prickly character with a flair for promotion (and self-promotion), credit him with breathing new life into the area. “He made it at a time when nobody was investing in Coney Island and created the Coney Island that we know today,” said Dianna Carlin, who runs the Lola Star boardwalk boutique. “I mean, what would Coney Island be without a mermaid parade?” Bambi the Mermaid Queen feels the same way. Bambi — real name: Andrea Cambridge — runs the Burlesque on the Beach show under Mr. Zigun’s artistic umbrella. She arrived in Coney Island in the early 1990s from Florida. “I have, you know, identified as a mermaid my whole life,” she said in an interview. Soon she was performing at the Mermaid Parade, where over the course of three years, she met her future husband, got engaged — he was dressed as Neptune for the occasion — and got married. Mr. Zigun officiated. “The level of passion and exuberance and joy in the parade — nothing matches it in my life,” she said, adding that the event was “just about beauty, creativity, love and no real judgments from anyone.” “I owe Dick my existence in New York and all my creative outlets,” she said. “I owe him, you know, pretty much everything.” As for the current rift, Mr. Zigun said the problems began when he turned 60 and asked the Coney Island USA board of directors about a pension. When it was denied, he said, he asserted intellectual property rights over the parade and the sideshow. “Their response was to fire me,” he said, adding that he “would be left destitute” by the amount of severance he was offered. “What am I going to do after the money runs out?” said Mr. Zigun, who was paid $66,528 as artistic director in 2019, according an organization tax filing. “I wanted to get to a point where when I was elderly, I would be healthy and a wacko, and I’m pretty much there already.” In a statement, Coney Island USA insisted that Mr. Zigun had been offered a “very generous severance agreement, which could have led to a more positive departure and recognition of his many contributions.” As of Tuesday, it appeared that the parties were trying to negotiate a more amicable resolution. In the meantime, the 40th annual Mermaid Parade is scheduled for June 18. After all, Mr. Rinn said, it is essential to “the Coney Island character.” “You know what it is?” he said. “There’s something about that neighborhood that brings out the fun, the eccentric, the odd, the weird. And the genuine.”"

Now we want to convince those curious friends to love mezzo-sopranos, the warm-toned bringers of humanity to opera. We hope you find lots here to discover and enjoy; leave your favorites in the comments. Why should you love mezzos? We’re the opera world’s salt of the earth. We’re the mother, the boyfriend, the impish page. We’re the sister, the princess, sometimes the goddess. OK, we’re also occasionally the witch! With apologies to my soprano sisters, our lower tessitura offers a warmer tone, as well as words that are more discernible in a range closer to speech. We’re slightly more relatable, if you will. We’re the viola, sometimes the cello, and we often strive for that richness and comfort. The following is an example of glorious vocalism by one of my idols and mentors: Christa Ludwig. She taught me Octavian, and her recordings taught me Mahler, Strauss, Schubert and Wagner. Here she is spinning out Brahms, accompanied by Leonard Bernstein. I would play an aria almost everyone has heard many times: “L’amour est un oiseau rebelle” — the “Habanera” from “Carmen.” The clarity and beauty of Grace Bumbry’s tone and the playfulness of her expression made me instantly fall in love, and I can imagine it would at the very least pique the interest of a newcomer. (The music is more than enough, but watching her sing it on film would truly leave anyone hooked.) When I was in high school, my choir teacher played a Grace Bumbry CD. I loved it so much that I took it home with me. This piece was one of the few arias I had heard at that point that just sounded fun to sing. Her voice is so buoyant and light, yet also strong and fervent. And her breathing technique is so skilled at handling Handel’s long, melismatic lines. Her expression sounded so easy and free. It all spoke to me, so intensely, at a young age. These five minutes changed my life. When I was about 10, I somehow got my hands on a CD of songs and arias featuring Marian Anderson. I played her “Ave Maria” again and again, with its halo of static hovering around her mellow tone, an emissary of beauty from long ago. It was how I fell in love with classical vocalism, and with opera. As always with Anderson, the singing is dignified, even decorous. But in her steady, intense swells of volume, you can’t help but feel the power of belief, breath, body. Sensuality is not absent from her artistry. There were many singers who influenced me and whom I tried to emulate: Risë Stevens, Janet Baker, Renata Tebaldi, Rosa Ponselle, Victoria de los Ángeles, Conchita Supervía. But I think the one I really paid the most attention to when I was 18, 19, 20, was Ebe Stignani. I did a lot of research on her, and I played her records constantly. I adored her particular legato, which was just extraordinary in “Orfeo,” and the “Samson et Dalila” arias. When I was a student, I used to listen to and admire a lot one of the very great Rossini specialists, Marilyn Horne. I especially appreciated and studied her legendary interpretations of male characters, such as Malcolm in “La Donna del Lago” and Arsace in “Semiramide.” In 1988 she recorded something different: Vivaldi’s “Orlando Furioso.” I was spellbound by the vocal fireworks, and Horne’s interpretation was the initial inspiration for my later Vivaldi projects. Thank you, dear Marilyn! I can hear this performance in my head: It was the first cut on the album “Presenting Marilyn Horne,” which came out in 1965. And if there was a part that fully suited her, it was Isabella in “L’Italiana in Algeri.” She was still called a soprano in those days, and there was the combination of that very strong lower register, even from the start, with a lightness, especially in this early recording. She goes way up in the cadenza to the high C. There’s lightness and flexibility to the sound, and dynamic variation — her amazing use of soft dynamics. She sings with such sweetness but also so much strength. When I think mezzo, the first name that comes to mind is Marilyn Horne. Her recordings of florid arias by Rossini, Vivaldi and Handel are widely known, but this gorgeous aria from Ambrose Thomas’s “Mignon” is well worth a trip off the beaten path. In under five minutes, you have a scena that is chock-full of beautiful long lines and gargantuan leaps that challenge the extremes of her seemingly limitless voice. A classical mezzo-soprano who later defected to free jazz, I was a contrarian who avoided the most beloved repertoire. I gravitated to what was then considered niche, digging into zarzuela and Spanish and Latin American art song, which brought me into contact with the rich voice of Teresa Berganza. She is known for interpretations of Rossini and Mozart, but when I was knee-deep in Manuel de Falla’s “Siete Canciones Populares Españolas,” I studied Berganza’s recordings closely, mesmerized by her delicacy and sensitivity to the folkloric ornamentation. In this live performance from 1960, “Polo” showcases her brilliant coloratura, moving seamlessly in and out of brute-force chest voice. Back to free jazz, when I met my musical hero Cecil Taylor, the virtuosic improvising pianist, I told him I was a vocalist. He took my hands in his and spoke low and close. Though I couldn’t grasp every word, he clearly repeated “Teresa Berganza” in a raspy whisper. I felt a cosmic vibration in our hands and shook my head vigorously, grinning in agreement. It may be partly because I’m a huge Cecilia Bartoli fan, partly because it is just so heartbreakingly glorious, and partly because it’s a challenge to sing well. But I love this aria. It challenges your stamina in terms of breath control, line, trill and the ability to convey deep emotional sentiment. You need fire in your belly and a core of steel and calm to be successful. Some mezzos specialize in so-called trouser roles, assuming the identity of young male characters. One of the best known trouser parts is Cherubino, the mischievous teenage page in Mozart’s “Le Nozze di Figaro.” In this recording, Frederica von Stade, a classic Cherubino, sings with luster and comedic flair. Many mezzos can sound a little forced trying to bring chesty power to their low range. Not the great Shirley Verrett, as in this thrilling account of “O don fatale” from Verdi’s “Don Carlo.” Her deep, rich lower voice has smoldering natural power and textured beauty. Yet during soaring flights, she tosses off top notes that any soprano would covet. (It’s no surprise that she also took on major soprano roles.) Combining vocal magnificence with dramatic intensity, Verrett’s Princess Eboli sounds impassioned and remorseful in cursing the allure of her own beauty. “I am lost to the world,” this song begins, even though the music can be relied upon to pull me back into it — consoling on the darkest of nights, or in the deepest of griefs. With its winding English horn and ethereal mezzo line, never more magically sung than by Janet Baker in 1967, Mahler’s shortest masterpiece is a love song, though a forlorn one. Our singer is lost to the world, and she insists that she is content with that, as her voice takes flight. But there are few simple joys here — rather a profound ambivalence. Suspensions linger everywhere, their exquisite agonies taking time to resolve. Is this the bliss of solitude? Heaven? Love? No, the final words reveal: It is the rapture of song. For me, the beauty of the mezzo voice is synonymous with Mahler. And while I do have a soft spot for the “Rückert-Lieder” (“Um Mitternacht,” in particular), the piece that first moved me, introducing me to the warmth of mezzos, is his “Kindertotenlieder.” In “Nun will die Sonn’ so hell aufgeh’n,” the first song in the cycle, the sparseness of the orchestration allows the simplicity and purity of the voice to really shine. The beautiful legato of Janet Baker’s sound is colored by the emotion she wrings out of the text. It gets me every time. Emmerich Kalman’s operetta “The Duchess of Chicago” was a hot ticket in Vienna in 1928. Kalman drew from his intimate knowledge of Hungarian dances and what he was able to learn of cutting-edge American styles like the Charleston. Among the numbers is this tune, which introduces Mary, the duchess of the title, who buys and sells European potentates at will. While the part was originally written for a soprano, a mezzo like Julia Bentley can emphasize the ironies of the libretto. Mary already seems to know that money isn’t everything — even as the dollar-fueled flexing of Americana is heard in the rhythm. One of the joys of being a composer is exploring performers’ gifts before writing for them. Occasionally, I encounter a beauty and skill that takes my breath away, making me pause with wonder and admiration. Such performances become springboards of inspiration. I recently experienced this while listening to the mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke, heard here in a lullaby and conveying the sound of effortless beauty and calm from a most artful voice. In opera, the spotlight tends to gravitate toward sopranos. But there have been exceptions, mostly in France, of leading female roles for mezzo-sopranos: the Carmens and Dalilas of the repertory. Among my favorites are those written by Berlioz, like Didon of “Les Troyens” and Marguerite of “La Damnation de Faust.” His song cycle “Les Nuits d’Été,” which has been adapted for different voice types, also sounds best in the mezzo tessitura. Hear how the deeper, rich-bodied lyricism in “Le spectre de la rose” complements the orchestration — at its most delicate, with pattering winds and pizzicato strings — then blossoms into a beaming high note with a mezzo-soprano’s trademark versatility. Some of the most intoxicating music in Wagner’s “Tristan und Isolde” is given not to the doomed lovers, but to Brangäne, Isolde’s hapless maid. Listen to Christa Ludwig sing her song of warning in the second act: standing watch over a tryst, her rich, otherworldly mezzo floats above the ethereal colors of the orchestra. Its spell is all the more powerful because of how it unfolds. The audience, which has just listened to an ecstatic, frenzied love duet, suddenly hears Brangäne’s distant warning as she tries in vain to pierce the rapturously beautiful music of their passion. One of the great mysteries of classical music is how composers can craft the most achingly beautiful music from the most tragic of emotions, simultaneously evoking pure sadness and astonished tranquillity, and perhaps even inviting acceptance. It takes a special artist to channel music in such a mystical way, and there have been few better marriages than that of Franz Schubert and Janet Baker. In this song, written in 1816, a mother sings a simple lullaby to her baby son, who has just died. Listen as Janet’s voice comforts, cries, calms and loves."

Ketamine can be delivered to your home. People are microdosing LSD to treat pandemic-related anxiety and Wall Street is pouring billions into companies that sell mind-altering drugs. It seems like psychedelics — though mostly still illegal — are everywhere. While the federal government does not recognize a medical use for most of these drugs and says they have potential for abuse, some of the most prominent universities in the world are studying four substances in particular: psilocybin, ketamine, MDMA and LSD. The bulk of available research suggests that these substances hold promise as part of larger treatment plans. There is also growing evidence that psychedelic drugs operate differently in the brain than addictive drugs, and advocates have been consistently calling for legalization. But psychedelics remain expensive and difficult to gain access to legally, unless you are part of a research study for mental health purposes. These drugs are not all the same and do come with risks. One quality they share is the ability to create an altered state of consciousness, commonly referred to as a trip. That effect can either provide a sense of perspective — or be downright terrifying. “You’re not likely to overdose on them, but you can have life-changing negative experiences,” Katharine Neill Harris, a drug policy researcher at Rice University in Texas, said. To avoid these experiences, while receiving the benefits these drugs can offer, people have started microdosing smaller amounts at regular intervals — but they are often doing so without professional guidance, and some remain uninformed about significant downsides with very little evidence of benefits. Here’s what researchers are learning about the psychedelic drugs most prominently involved in mental health research. As the active chemical in magic mushrooms, or ’shrooms, psilocybin is the most studied of the psychedelic chemicals found in plants and fungi, and it’s the most likely to become an accepted mental health therapy soon. After last year’s legalization in Oregon, entrepreneurs began investing tens of millions in psilocybin research there, and other cities and states are following suit. Potential mental health uses: Research conducted in the last decade suggests that psilocybin, typically taken in pill form, has the potential to treat substance use disorders, including alcoholism and nicotine addiction, as well as depression. That research isn’t conclusive yet, said Paul Hutson, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies psilocybin and leads the school’s center for psychedelics research. But he anticipates there will soon be enough evidence for the Food and Drug Administration to approve psilocybin capsules to treat at least some of these disorders — most likely in the next five years or so. In the meantime, clinical trials of psilocybin for a variety of conditions are taking place across the country, though they can be difficult to find or have long waiting lists. Still, it’s safer, Dr. Hutson said, to try psilocybin as part of a study than on your own or in one of the treatment clinics that have popped up. In these trials, patients attend appointments to prepare for and process their psychedelic trip with a professional in an environment where any side effects can be managed. What it does: According to users who have participated in trials, a mushroom trip may induce euphoria and an increased awareness of parts of their environment. For instance, solid objects might seem to breathe in and out. A trip can last more than six hours, and some people describe a positive “afterglow” lasting for months. Risks: Psilocybin can cause distressing hallucinations or feelings of panic and anxiety in some patients, especially at high doses. You can’t be guaranteed safety standards — having a trained professional who can reassure you, protect you and even administer drugs during a bad trip — in therapy outside of a research trial, Dr. Harris said. One use of psilocybin, which should not be confused with standard treatment described above, is microdosing. By taking small doses — perhaps 10 percent of a standard dose — every few days, some people might experience mental health benefits without the high. But microdosing psilocybin can be harmful, and there is some evidence that it can damage the heart over time. Recent research also suggests that the positive impacts of microdosing in humans may be largely caused by the placebo effect. First synthesized in 1956, ketamine, sometimes called Special K, is used today as an anesthetic by veterinarians and in emergency or combat medicine. Because it is the one psychedelic that’s never been illegal, researchers have been able to explore ketamine’s potential as a mental health treatment — and build a case for its use in humans. Potential mental health uses: Many brain disorders — like schizophrenia, depression and anxiety — are characterized by atrophy in the prefrontal cortex. The evidence is strong, though not yet conclusive, that ketamine helps people with psychiatric disorders by promoting regrowth over time in neurons in this area. That could help explain the near-immediate feelings of relief that users report, which is one of the reasons it has been used in the treatment of suicidal patients. Esketamine, a form of ketamine, showed such promise for treating major depression, often faster than other drugs, that the F.D.A. approved its limited use in early 2019. What it does: Ketamine can create euphoria and provide a sense of detachment from reality. Users taking a low dose might feel as though they’re floating or that their body is numb. Higher doses can temporarily make people clumsy and forget where they are or even who they are. Blurred vision or hallucinations are common. Ketamine works differently from other psychedelics. Most psychedelics — like LSD, MDMA and those derived from plants — operate by affecting serotonin receptors, which alter mood and happiness. Ketamine affects a different class of brain receptors that are important for learning and memory. Both kinds of receptors are found in the brain’s prefrontal cortex, which might explain why ketamine and the other psychedelics seem to have similar impacts on mental health. “The prefrontal cortex is a brain region that’s really critical,” said David Olson, a chemistry professor at University of California, Davis, who studies chemicals that affect brain function. “It talks to a whole bunch of brain regions that regulate things like mood, emotion, fear, reward.” Risks: Ketamine is also known for a specific and scary side effect nicknamed the “k-hole.” It’s rare in clinical settings, but users may feel disassociated from themselves and their surroundings and panic or feel paranoid. “Turn on, tune in, drop out.” “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.” Silicon Valley microdosing. Suffice it to say, LSD, also known as acid, has a storied place in American popular culture. Potential mental health uses: It’s shown promise for treating alcohol addiction and has been studied for other conditions like depression. As with psilocybin, some new LSD adherents microdose to achieve mental health benefits without the trip. What it does: LSD users have reported feelings of bliss during their trip, being able to see sound and having mystical experiences as well as a sense of closeness with others. Risks: Some people experience lasting psychological trauma caused by a bad trip, especially when they take higher doses or use LSD often. Microdosing LSD may have physical risks, too. In a study on rats, microdosing LSD had the opposite effect of a trip; it made the rats display signs of psychiatric illness, like aggression and poor grooming. Similar to microdosing psilocybin, it may also strain the heart by overworking the neurons around the organ. “If you’re constantly stimulating these neurons, even with a small dose of these compounds, the neurons just can’t take it,” Dr. Olson said. A well-known club drug, also known as ecstasy or molly, MDMA has been researched on and off for decades for potential mental health benefits. While the drug remains illegal, the F.D.A. allows its use in research and treatment for life-threatening illness. Potential mental health uses: In 2010, results from a study on treatment-resistant PTSD renewed interest in MDMA research. Since then, it has also been explored as a treatment for other conditions like substance use disorder or social anxiety in autistic people, although it has more potential to cause damage than some other psychedelics. What it does: MDMA is often known by its street name — ecstasy — from the feeling of euphoria and connectedness it promotes in users. Risks: MDMA can cause lasting kidney and organ damage as well as heart arrhythmias during a trip, especially in patients with related pre-existing conditions. *** Psychedelic drugs aren’t simple substances. More time and research will provide answers about their effects on the brain and whether it’s possible to use them for medical treatments. For now, Dr. Hutson cautioned that evidence supports psychedelic treatments only in cases where other forms of treatment haven’t worked. “They’re not a panacea that everybody is going to respond to,” he said."

Seven independent lab studies have found that while Omicron’s mutations make it exceptionally good at causing breakthrough cases even in people who have been vaccinated or previously infected, they also render it less able to effectively infect the lower lungs, a step associated with more serious illness. Plus, in country after country where Omicron has spread, epidemiological data shows that vaccines are still helping prevent severe disease or worse. Why isn’t that unalloyed good news? Because it’s just luck that this highly transmissible variant appears to be less dangerous than other variants to those with prior immunity. If it had been more deadly — as Delta has been — the U.S. government’s haphazard and disorganized response would have put the whole country much more at risk. Even with this more moderate threat, the highest-ranking public health officials are making statements that seem more aimed at covering up or making excuses for ongoing failures, rather than leveling with the public. Nowhere are these issues more apparent than on the confusing and zigzag messaging around rapid antigen tests and N95 masks, both of which are important weapons in our arsenal. With a barrage of cases threatening vital services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Dec. 29 that people could return to work, masked, five days after they first learned they were infected, arguing that many people are infectious for only a short period. People could return to work even while still sick, as long as their symptoms were abating. It’s not unreasonable to shorten quarantine for some, especially if they are vaccinated. Other countries have allowed infected people to isolate for a shorter time with the added precaution that they take rapid antigen tests to show they are negative two days in a row. Why doesn’t the C.D.C. call for that added measure of safety? Its director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, has explained this by saying, “We know that after five days, people are much less likely to transmit the virus and that masking further reduces that risk.” “Much less likely” isn’t zero, and the likelihood probably varies from person to person. All this means that some would continue to be infectious. So wouldn’t it be great if we could tell who was probably still infectious after five days, and took extra precautions, while allowing people who may be clearing the virus even faster than five days to stop isolating earlier? Not according to our top officials. “We opted not to have the rapid test for isolation because we actually don’t know how our rapid tests perform and how well they predict whether you’re transmissible during the end of disease,” Walensky said on Dec. 29. “The F.D.A. has not authorized them for that use.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president’s chief medical adviser, argued the same, also on Dec. 29. Referring to antigen tests, he said, “If it’s positive, we don’t know what that means for transmissibility” and that these antigen tests aren’t as sensitive as P.C.R. tests. Might the real reason be that rapid tests are hard to find and expensive here (while they are easily available and relatively cheap in other countries)? Is it possible that rapid tests are a good way to see who is infectious and who can return to public life — and their lack of sensitivity to minute amounts of virus is actually a good thing? Let’s ask a brilliant scientist and public health advocate — Rochelle Walensky, circa 2020. Walensky, who was then on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School and chief of the division of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, was a co-author of a paper in September 2020 that declared that the “P.C.R.-based nasal swab your caregiver uses in the hospital does a great job determining if you are infected but it does a rotten job of zooming in on whether you are infectious.” That’s right, the key question is who is infectious, who can pass on the virus, not whether someone is still harboring some small amount of virus, or even fragments of it. P.C.R. tests can detect such tiny amounts of the virus that they can “return positives for as many as 6-12 weeks,” she pointed out. That’s “long after a person has ceased to pose any real risk of transmission to others.” P.C.R. tests are a bit like being able to find a thief’s fingerprints after he’s left the house. So what did 2020 Walensky recommend? “The antigen test is ideally suited to yield positive results precisely when the infected individual is maximally infectious,” she and her co-author concluded. The reason is that antigen tests respond to the viral load in the sample without biologically amplifying the amount and being able to detect even viral fragments, as P.C.R. tests do. So a rapid test turns positive if a sample contains high levels of virus, not nonviable bits or minute amounts — and it’s high viral loads that correlate to higher infectiousness. What about the objection that rapid antigen tests don’t always detect infections as well as P.C.R. tests can? The 2020 Walensky wrote that the F.D.A. shouldn’t worry about “false negatives” on rapid tests because “those are true negatives for disease transmission” — meaning that people are unlikely to spread the virus even if they have a bit of virus lingering. In other words, the fact that rapid tests are less likely to turn positive if the viral load isn’t high is a benefit, not a problem. Rapid tests do have their own considerations. Since you can become infectious even a day or two after getting a negative result on a rapid test, the Walensky of September 2020 noted that rapid tests are most useful if they are used frequently. A paper she co-wrote in July 2020 found that if a test was used every two days it would allow for safely reopening colleges. The brilliant explanations of Walensky in 2020 leave me at a loss to explain why President Biden said on Dec. 22 that “I wish I had thought about ordering half a billion” rapid tests two months ago. Indeed, why didn’t officials do so two months ago, or 10 months ago? The administration needs to do more to ramp up production of what should be one crucial tool in controlling the spread of the virus and allowing people to return to normal. It’s hard not to worry that officials may be denigrating rapid tests now for the same reason they denigrated the use of masks early in the pandemic — we don’t have enough of them. Fauci essentially acknowledged this about masks, saying that the public health community had feared that they “were in very short supply” — a fair concern, but that’s not what we were told. I wouldn’t be surprised if officials eventually admitted the same about rapid tests. We’re also hearing the same paternalistic argument about the tests that officials once used to explain why people shouldn’t wear masks — that it would provide them with a false sense of security that would lead them to abandon other necessary precautions. What if people stop washing their hands because masks made them feel more confident? Top officials at the World Health Organization asked me that in the spring of 2020. A September 2020 article about rapid tests in Nature noted that people like the virologist Marion Koopmans worried that if these tests became more widely available, people would just use them and say, “It’s negative, so I’m clear.” The threat of a “false sense of security” has been used against everything from seatbelts to teaching young kids how to swim (because that would supposedly encourage parents to stop watching their children in the water!). Research and common sense shows what one would expect: Safety measures make people safer and people who choose to use them are looking to be safer — if anything, they do more of everything. (Parents should watch their young children in the water, but kids who learn to swim are less likely to drown.) That’s why it was extra disappointing to hear Walensky argue recently that “if you got a rapid test at five days and it was negative, we weren’t convinced that you weren’t still transmissible. We didn’t want to leave a false sense of security. We still wanted you to wear the mask.” To start with, what if you were to test positive? People who test negative are less likely to transmit the virus — so even if Walensky’s argument were true and these people would then not be using masks, this would be less of a problem than having an infectious person in public when a rapid test could have kept him or her in isolation. Besides, if health officials told people to wear a mask for five more days even after they tested negative on the fifth day, responsible people would likely still do so. Extra information doesn’t automatically turn responsible people into irresponsible ones. Now, about those masks: The C.D.C. still says that some N95s should be reserved for health care workers, even though they provide better protection for the wearer and the public than cloth or surgical masks, and even though there is no longer a shortage of them. According to Walensky, N95s “are very hard to breathe in” and “are very hard to tolerate” so she worries that “if we suggest or require that people wear an N95, they won’t wear them all the time.” Yet I’ve worn N95s many times, and there are many comfortable ones — some better than cloth masks because the seal is so good that my glasses don’t fog up. And if it were a problem, why hasn’t the C.D.C. made sure there were more comfortable ones available? Dr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease specialist who’s pushed for more protective masks for the public from the beginning, recently pointed out that as far back as 2008, N95s have been approved for public use during a public health emergency. What happened to that now that we have an actual pandemic? Even my own doctor complained that he wasn’t sure which ones being sold were counterfeit — baffling that this is still a problem, even two years in. Why hasn’t the government organized a system to guide people to buy real N95s? Or better yet, how about mailing some to people free? At a minimum, Walensky could tell people that N95s are more protective and let people opt for them if they chose. All this has left people with the sense that they are on their own, searching for guidance and getting more confused, and perhaps wondering why the government seems so unprepared for the latest Covid wave. So what now? Until we have enough tests, we need to triage their use, making them a priority for critical infrastructure like hospitals, emergency services, public transportation and schools. We also need to stop asking that people who test positive on an antigen test confirm it with a P.C.R. test, as many workplaces still do. Doctors have told me that people who needed test results were flooding emergency rooms, clogging up the operation and perhaps getting infected just as they received a test saying they were negative. Students and teachers are returning to classrooms without reliable access to tests. With many districts failing to invest enough in ventilation and HEPA air filtration to lower airborne transmission, there will be outbreaks in schools. We can’t just keep telling parents that most children will be fine. And when those rapid tests finally become available, will we have to convince parents that the same tests that were supposedly not useful are suddenly able to detect infectiousness? Which brings me to another important question: Why aren’t we rushing to do studies to gauge the infectious period for Omicron? Why didn’t we start in late November when it became clear it would be causing many breakthroughs and a rapid increase in cases? After hearing people around me say they were testing positive on Day 8, 9 and beyond even if they were double- and triple-vaccinated, I did an informal poll on Twitter asking people infected in the Omicron wave when they stopped testing positive. More than 2,600 people responded, and a whopping 43 percent said they had tested positive on rapid tests on Day 8 and beyond, while about 30 percent said they were testing negative on Day 5 or even earlier. The immunologist Michael Mina, a longtime advocate of rapid tests, thinks people may either be quickly clearing the virus, or the virus may take hold and replicate well for a longer time — something lab studies suggest is happening, and reflected in my informal poll. So the five-day period can be too long or too short. Once I ran the survey on Twitter, I heard from a lot more people, too, with stories of both prolonged positives and quick negatives, but also frustration. Why, two years into the pandemic, are any people relying on my survey to try to puzzle through whether they should see a grandparent or an elderly relative or go back to work if they are still testing positive? Why are we still trying to figure this out on our own? On Tuesday, the C.D.C. updated its guidance to say that “if an individual has access to a test and wants to test” and is positive after five days, he or she should “continue to isolate until Day 10.” So is the C.D.C. now conceding that people who test positive are indeed still infectious? And if they don’t have a test, or don’t want one, no worries? The job these officials have is tough, given both the reckless political opposition even to vaccines and the inevitable criticism even from people who support public health measures. Still, it’s so disappointing to enter 2022 with 2020 vibes, scouring for supplies, trying to make sense of official declarations that don’t cohere, and wondering what to do. The government can help us pull out of this fog, but it should always be based on being honest with the public. We aren’t expecting officials to have crystal balls about everything, but we want them to empower and inform us while preparing for eventualities — good or bad. Two years is too long to still be hoping for luck to get through all this."

Officials said eight children were among the dead. “This is without a doubt one of the most tragic days in our city’s history, the loss of so many people in such a tragic way,” Mayor Jim Kenney said at a news conference. “Losing so many kids is just devastating.” Jacuita Purifoy told reporters on Wednesday afternoon that the children were her nieces and nephews, and that three of her sisters had also died in the fire. One nephew, a 5-year-old, had survived and was in a hospital, she said. “He wants his mom, he wants his dad, he wants his sister, he wants his cousins,” Ms. Purifoy said. She described the sisters as close — even more so since the recent death of their father. As the sun set on Wednesday evening and bodies were being removed from the rowhouse, the victims’ family members gathered in a circle and said a prayer. Firefighters arrived at the building in the city’s Fairmount neighborhood, just north of Center City, about 6:40 a.m. to find “heavy fire” billowing from the second floor, officials said. It took 50 minutes to get the flames under control. Eight people fled from the building and two people, one of them a child, were taken to nearby hospitals, said Craig Murphy, first deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia Fire Department. The city had initially reported the death toll as 13, including seven children, but revised both figures on Wednesday evening. “I’ve been around for 35 years now, and this is probably one of the worst fires I’ve ever been to,” he said. “We plan on making sure that this tremendous loss of life did not happen in vain.” Mr. Murphy said the cause of the fire was under investigation. “We have all hands on deck because of the magnitude of this fire,” he said. The building was run by the federally funded Philadelphia Housing Authority, city officials said. Sumara Wright, 18, said one of the victims was a close friend and classmate. “I had just seen him two days ago riding his bike,” she said. She said that her friend and his siblings had been in the house on Wednesday morning. “We were close like family, we grew up together.” City leaders were visibly shaken by the horror of the fire, which had a death toll higher than the 2008 house blaze that killed seven people and the 1985 police bombing of members of the group MOVE, which killed 11 people and burned down 61 homes. At least four smoke detectors in the rowhouse where 12 people were killed on Wednesday did not go off during the fire, said Craig Murphy, first deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia Fire Department. He said that four smoke detectors were installed in 2019, and that there was another inspection in 2020. “When they went out that time, they installed two smoke detectors,” he said. Darrell L. Clarke, Philadelphia’s City Council president, said in an interview that investigators were still trying to determine whether any of the smoke detectors in the rowhouse had been working. “People, from time to time, they take the batteries out when they’re cooking,” he said, adding that larger public housing complexes in the city require hard-wired smoke detectors. The ones in the rowhouse were battery-powered, fire officials said. There were 26 people in the building at the time of the fire, including eight people on the first floor, Mr. Murphy said. “That is a tremendous amount of people to be living in a duplex.” Mayor Jim Kenney said the city does not run the federally funded Philadelphia Housing Authority, which managed the building. He urged the public to consider the circumstances that may have led to so many people staying in the building at the time of the fire. “Sometimes it’s better for people to be indoors than on the street,” Mr. Kenney said. “Maybe there were people or relatives that needed to be sheltered.” He added, “We can’t make judgments on the people in the house because sometimes people just need to be indoors.” Officer Eric McLaurin, a spokesman for the Police Department, said the fire quickly overwhelmed the rowhouse, which had been converted into two apartments. “You just pray for all involved,” Officer McLaurin said. “It’s a bad situation.” Laurie Roma woke to screams on Wednesday from the apartment building across the street. “When I looked outside,” Ms. Roma, 44, said, “I saw orange flames coming out of the second-floor windows, and there was a man screaming for help.” She heard someone shout that they had tried calling 911 but could not get through. Ms. Roma herself dialed at 6:39 a.m., she said, and no one answered the emergency line. “Someone ran with their own ladder down the street,” she said. “I think people were desperate to help.” Craig Murphy, the first deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia Fire Department, told reporters that he had not heard of people who were unable to get through to 911. Firefighters arrived two minutes after her call, Ms. Roma said, and worked quickly to suppress the blaze. Mario Mercado-Diaz, another tenant in Ms. Roma’s three-story apartment building, said he had often seen children who lived in the burned rowhouse playing on the street. Officials said eight children were among the 12 people killed in the blaze. “It’s a multigenerational family that lived there,” Mr. Mercado-Diaz said. “And they were good neighbors. I would say hi to them and they would say hi back, and they’re always very watchful of stuff going on.” Survivors of the fire that killed 12 people, including eight children, gathered at an elementary school about a block south of the scorched rowhouse on Wednesday morning. Cries could be heard from inside as a helicopter whirred overhead. One woman embraced another with a Salvation Army blanket draped around her and told a reporter she could not answer questions yet. “It’s too hard right now,” she said. Darrell L. Clarke, Philadelphia’s City Council president, said that several of the children who died were students at the Bache-Martin School, where survivors gathered. Mr. Clarke represents the Fairmount neighborhood where the fire took place. Shalai Young, a mental health technician who lives in Northeast Philadelphia, stood nearby, observing the damage. “When you see so many people lose their lives in one area, that’s tragic,” she said.Ms. Young said her work had brought her to the neighborhood before, which she described as “family oriented.” Dozens of firefighters and police officers milled around the rowhouse near the corner of 23rd and Parrish Streets in the Fairmount neighborhood, north of Center City. Many windows had been smashed out and were blackened by rings of soot. By late afternoon, a fire truck remained parked in front of the burned house, with its ladder extended toward the building. A large yellow tarp was draped over it to block the view of the building’s entrance, as firefighters removed the bodies of victims. Ms. Young said she was hoping to help the family and any neighbors displaced by the blaze, starting with “the necessities.” “In a fire, you lose things that we take for granted every day, you know, shoes, socks, blankets, pajamas, toiletries,” she said. “Anything, any way I can help.” Mr. Clarke, the City Council president, said his office had been flooded with offers of resources for the victims of the fire. “It’s a tightknit community,” he said. “The outpouring of support is encouraging.” Five children were killed in a fire at a day care center in a two-story house in Erie, Pa. The city’s fire chief said the house had only one smoke detector — in the attic — and had overloaded extension cords running beneath a couch. The victims ranged in age from 9 months to 14 years old and were sleeping upstairs in the two-story house when the fire was reported. Ten children died when a fire broke out in an apartment building in the Little Village section of Chicago. The children were attending a sleepover at the time. The building’s owner was cited with more than 40 building code violations. Thirteen people died when a five-alarm fire engulfed an apartment building in the Bronx, the deadliest blaze in New York City in more than a quarter of a century. The fire started when a 3-year-old boy was playing with the burners of a stove, the authorities said at the time. A hot plate warming food for the Sabbath sparked a fire that tore through the Brooklyn home of an Orthodox Jewish family, killing seven children. There were no smoke detectors on the first floor of the home where the fire broke out or on the second floor where the family members had been sleeping. Ten people, including eight children, were killed when a fire swept through a home in Brockway, Pa., a rural town about 100 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. The victims ranged in age from 4 months to 40 years old. A Christmas Eve fire at a high-rise hotel that had been converted into apartments for seniors in Johnson City, Tenn., killed 16 people, including 14 residents. The fire, which started in the living room of one of the apartments, injured 30 people, including 15 firefighters. A police helicopter dropped a bomb on a rowhouse in West Philadelphia where members of the communal, anti-government group MOVE lived, an action that the City Council apologized for in 2020 after decades of intense criticism. Eleven people, including five children, were killed, and more than 60 nearby homes were destroyed by the fire. A man with a lengthy criminal record and a history of mental illness intentionally started a fire in an apartment building in Waterbury, Conn., after an argument with a niece who lived there. The fire killed 14 people and displaced more than 100 residents. The man was sentenced to two consecutive life terms for the deadly arson. Smoke detectors in the two apartments where 12 people were killed in a fire on Wednesday morning were last inspected in 2021, according to the Philadelphia Housing Authority, the federally funded agency that runs the building. There were four smoke detectors in the building that did not operate during the fire in the city’s Fairmount neighborhood, Craig Murphy, first deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia Fire Department, said on Wednesday morning. Dinesh Indala, executive vice president of housing operations at the Philadelphia Housing Authority, told reporters at the scene of the fire that he did not know what caused the smoke detectors to stop working between inspections in 2021 and the fire on Wednesday morning. He said it was also unclear why 26 people were in the building, where two families lived. “It’s the holidays, I don’t know if they had people coming and visiting, I have no idea,” Mr. Indala said. He said that the most recent inspection of the B unit of the building was on May 5, 2021, and that six smoke detectors and three carbon monoxide monitors were working at the time. The agency replaced smoke detectors in the unit during an inspection in September 2019, he added. The last inspection of the A unit was on April 23, 2021, and seven smoke detectors and three carbon monoxide monitors were in the apartment and another two were installed, Mr. Indala said. He said the property has been owned by the Philadelphia Housing Authority since the 1960s. According to the agency, more than 80,000 people in Philadelphia live in its homes. Mr. Murphy, the Fire Department official, said there had also been an inspection in 2020. Mr. Indala said that the housing authority inspected its properties annually, and that a priority in those inspections was checking smoke detectors and carbon monoxide monitors. If people living in one of the housing authority’s homes have issues with these devices, he said, they should contact the agency immediately and will receive a response within 24 hours. Philadelphia’s leaders mourned the deaths of four adults and eight children in a rowhouse fire on Wednesday, struggling to put their grief into words in the aftermath of the blaze. Mayor Jim Kenney called the fire “tragic” at a news conference outside the burned-out rowhouse, in the city’s Fairmount neighborhood. “I don’t have much more to say than please keep all these folks, and especially these children, in your prayers,” he said. Mr. Kenney, whose father was a firefighter, later recalled how fires that killed children left his own family grieving in their aftermath. His father, he said, “would basically lock himself in his bedroom for a couple of days and my mother would say, basically, ‘Don’t go near the door.’” Fire Department leaders were similarly emotional as they described what firefighters found once they were able to enter the building. “It was terrible,” said Craig Murphy, first deputy fire commissioner. “I’ve been around for 35 years now and this is probably one of the worst fires I have ever been to.” He added, shaking his head: “I don’t have the words for how we’re feeling right now as a community and as a Fire Department.” Darrell L. Clarke, the president of the City Council, said the city would try to learn from the fire and what led to the tragedy. “This just punched you in the gut,” he said. City Council members called for accountability, though the cause of the fire was not immediately clear. “We must learn from what occurred here to prevent it from happening again,” one member, Jamie Gauthier, wrote on Twitter. “This is an immensely dark day for Philadelphia,” another council member, Kendra Brook, said. “We must get to the root cause of this horrific tragedy so that it never happens again.”"
59,The New York Times,nytimes,Breaking News: Novak Djokovic’s entry to Australia was mired in confusion after a dispute over his visa and questions about the vaccine medical exemption he received to play in the Australian Open.,https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3F2K6w9%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0J8AmVrm5p2isS11rpln35CalsoyWzZEsCmer4f6pSJLwL8sbZR72yoi0&h=AT0t3OqGihjYXzaf6xAuSc4URxl_hutDt0fVRPGhYmxx_CfxBAlvQBjoXojB4CPkzb-7evTGnGP5quE-J7ND5PDb6yuxql2OJGRBYLOukuglQUQdx2V0-hDWHy5x5YfqBCF2To4Jkhyt1OzzDees&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT3U-LYU71wAFHAHheKKyoLaluvTlw1MLlOMPVIh8IhT1HHA8nyqrlG9e4ShHb5KYSE9vGI0pcjpNLcwNPlQSAe189zB60ddSf0u1UEkaSC1v6B3EROOhF8RNp0cChOdCll8xJpluLKAAP6C46uM0rifech4-fTirN_2A5nEUh8gnSt3,1d,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday endorsed booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for children ages 12 to 17, citing rising infections in teens and young adults and a troubling increase in pediatric hospitalizations. As the contagious Omicron variant spreads through the country, public health officials have seized on extra vaccine doses as a first line of defense. Pfizer-BioNTech boosters are now authorized for any American older than 12 who is five months past his or her second dose of the vaccine. An advisory committee recommended the changes following a meeting on Wednesday. They were endorsed by Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director, on Wednesday night. Adolescents ages 12 to 15 may begin to receive boosters immediately. Adolescents ages 16 and older were already permitted to receive booster shots, but on Wednesday the C.D.C. panel strengthened the recommendation. The advisory panel followed a similar move earlier this week by the Food and Drug Administration, which authorized Pfizer-BioNtech boosters for adolescents and shortened the recommended time interval between the initial vaccine regimen and the booster. The F.D.A. also endorsed “an additional primary dose” of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for moderately or severely immunocompromised children aged 5 to 11, to be given 28 days after their second shots.  Studies suggest that vaccine side effects are minimal in children, although there is lingering concern about a link to myocarditis, a rare inflammation of the heart muscle that occurs more frequently in young men, following vaccination. In Israel, which started administering boosters to adolescents aged 12 to 15 in June and rigorously tracks side effects, the health ministry identified two cases of myocarditis, among some 41,600 adolescents in this age group who received the booster. Both children were hospitalized briefly and have fully recovered, said Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, an Israeli health official who addressed the committee. The booster dramatically reduced infection rates among children aged 12 to 15, Dr. Alroy-Preis said. Although most infected youngsters generally did not experience severe Covid disease that required hospitalization, two children — one boy and one girl — have died, she said. But while much of the committee’s discussion focused on the risks of the vaccine and its side effects, Dr. Camille Kotton, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who specializes in transplant and immunocompromised patients, said the focus should be on the disease itself, which is having a devastating effect on vulnerable and immunocompromised patients. “This is an important thing to think about — the risk of myocarditis from the disease itself,” Dr. Kotton said. Though Omicron is generally perceived as causing less severe disease, she said, she now sees numerous patients on life support. Some have died. “It’s a horrible state of affairs,” she said. “The highly infectious nature of Omicron is such that patients who have been incredibly careful the last two years have been getting infected with awful outcomes.” Dr. Katherine Poehling, director of pediatric population health at Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., expressed similar sentiments. “There are children waiting in the emergency department 18 hours and longer to get into the hospital because we’re so full,” she said. “We have parents asking us can their children get a booster dose, like older children.” But several committee members said they were increasingly disturbed that only a minority of younger children are getting vaccinated at all, and said it is critical to increase the rates and adhere to other prevention strategies, like masking. “We can’t put all of the burden on the people who are willing to get vaccinated,” said Lynn Bahta, a committee member who is a registered nurse with the Minnesota Department of Health. “When we have only half our adolescents vaccinated, that adds more burden as well. I am so concerned that the burden of disease prevention is all falling on the vaccinated and them getting the boosters.” More than 70 percent of people 12 and older in the United States are fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C. Children younger than age 5 are still not eligible for vaccination. Americans aged 18 and older who received Moderna’s vaccine can get a booster of any available coronavirus vaccine six months after the second shot. Those who received Johnson & Johnson’s single-shot vaccine may get a booster dose of any available vaccine two months after their first shot. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are both strongly preferred over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the C.D.C. has said. Only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is authorized for children ages 5 to 11; boosters are not yet recommended for this group. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday said it was not changing its definition of “full vaccination” against the coronavirus. But the agency changed its emphasis on the appropriate regimen, tweaking how it referred to the shots. The agency said that three doses of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna’s vaccines should be considered “up-to-date” inoculations, and that Johnson & Johnson recipients should receive a second dose, preferably of Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech, to also be considered up to date. The move amounted to a recommendation from federal health officials that Americans should change how they talk about vaccination schedules. People 12 years and older are eligible for boosters. “Consistent with how public health has historically viewed or even talked about how we recommend vaccines, we are now recommending that individuals stay up to date with additional doses that they are eligible for,” Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, said at a White House news briefing on Wednesday. The C.D.C. did not change the definition of what qualifies as full vaccination — a subject of intense interest to corporations, schools, state health departments and professional sports leagues, which have themselves been reconsidering what it means to be fully vaccinated. “The technical definition of ‘fully vaccinated’ — two doses of an mRNA vaccine or one dose of the J & J vaccine — has not changed,” Kristen Nordlund, a C.D.C. spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Individuals are considered fully vaccinated once they have received their primary series.” She added that the agency recommend that people “stay ‘up to date’ by receiving any additional doses they are eligible for, according to C.D.C.’s recommendations, to ensure they have optimal protection.” Parents across Chicago raced to find child care on Wednesday morning after jarring news: Classes in the nation’s third-largest public school district were canceled. The teachers’ union and Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration had failed to agree on how to keep schools open during an Omicron-fueled virus surge. Across the country, the wildly contagious Omicron variant has infected millions and complicated the return to classrooms and workplaces. But nowhere has returning to school been more acrimonious and unpredictable than in Chicago, where, after two days back in classrooms following winter break, 73 percent of teachers voted to stop reporting to work. The city responded by calling off school altogether, refusing the teachers’ call for remote instruction. With no deal reached by Wednesday evening, district officials said classes would be canceled again on Thursday. The abrupt pause in the academic calendar, rooted in years of enmity between the Chicago Teachers Union and City Hall, jumbled plans for hundreds of thousands of students and posed another major test for Ms. Lightfoot, a Democrat whose tenure has been marked by labor strife, the pandemic and a surge in homicides. “If they are in class and Covid is rampaging, that’s a problem. If they are not there and out on the streets, that’s a problem,” said Tamar Manasseh, who leads an anti-violence group in the city, and who said she was looking into ways to help children with nowhere to go during the day. “This has put us in an untenable situation.” Ms. Lightfoot, whose disagreements with the Chicago Teachers Union date back to a strike in the early months of her term, said in an interview that the two sides remained far apart as negotiations continued. Ms. Lightfoot said she intended to take legal action against the union, and on Monday evening said the city had filed an unfair labor practices complaint. The school district opened buildings for meal distribution on Wednesday and published a list of places where parents could get emergency child care. “The consequences of the union acting like this time and time again are profound,” Ms. Lightfoot said. She added, “You think about the consequences for the families to be faced with the hostage choice of either going to work or taking care of their kids and home-schooling — no parent should be put in that position.” Australia blocked Novak Djokovic, the top-ranked men’s tennis player in the world, from entering the nation ahead of the Australian Open tournament, after immigration authorities said he didn’t meet entry requirements. “Mr. Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia, and his visa has been subsequently canceled,” the Australian Border Force said in a statement. “Noncitizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa canceled will be detained and removed from Australia.” His arrival in the country on Wednesday was mired in confusion after an airport dispute about the validity of his visa and questions about the evidence supporting an exemption from being vaccinated. Australia allows travelers who can show proof either of vaccination or of a valid medical reason for not being vaccinated to enter the country without quarantining. Djokovic, an outspoken critic of vaccine mandates, has not said publicly whether he has been vaccinated against the coronavirus. But he announced on Tuesday that he had received a medical exemption from the Australian Open’s vaccine mandate to defend his title in Melbourne, where the year’s first major tennis tournament is played. Tournament officials confirmed that in a statement on Tuesday, saying his application had been reviewed by two independent panels, a procedure that strongly suggested that he was unvaccinated. An Australian newspaper, The Age, reported that a plane carrying Djokovic landed at Tullamarine Airport in Melbourne around 11:30 p.m. local time on Wednesday, and that Djokovic, who is Serbian, was still being questioned by officials from the Australian Border Force more than six hours later. Kyrie Irving, the star Nets guard, made his regular-season debut against the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night following the team’s surprise reversal of its policy to bar him from practices and road games until he received the coronavirus vaccine. Irving looked rusty early on against the Pacers, missing his first three shots. But in the second quarter in Indianapolis, he began to heat up and scored 8 straight points. Irving declined to be vaccinated for Covid-19 before the season, making him ineligible to play in New York City because of a local vaccine mandate at sports arenas that went into effect in September. The Nets, citing concerns about team chemistry, announced in October that Irving would not be permitted to play in road games either, even if laws in those cities would allow him to participate. The N.B.A. does not require players to be vaccinated. For the most part, the team has played well in Irving’s absence, and has led the Eastern Conference for much of the season. Entering Wednesday, the Nets were No. 2 in the East, behind Chicago, with a 23-12 record after losing four of their last six games. But last month, as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus began ravaging N.B.A. rosters, the Nets announced they would let Irving play in road games. Sean Marks, the team’s general manager, said at the time that the Nets were “faced with a roster that has been decimated over the course of the last several days.” Several of the Nets’ top players, including Kevin Durant and James Harden, have missed games because of the league’s virus-related health and safety protocols. Irving was immediately placed into the protocols as well. The N.B.A.’s rules say an unvaccinated player can be placed into the protocols because of a positive or inconclusive test, or a confirmed exposure to a person who had tested positive. Players can be cleared to play again through testing and isolation periods that vary according to the players’ symptoms but that can be as short as a few days. When Irving returned to action on Wednesday night, all of the Nets’ roster was available except guard Joe Harris, who is out with an ankle injury. The United States Postal Service says it wants an exemption to the federal vaccine-or-test mandate because it could hinder its ability to deliver the mail. “The Postal Service is seeking temporary relief because it wants to ensure that its ability to deliver mail and packages is not hindered amid the current disruptions in the nation’s supply chain,” Darlene Casey, a U.S.P.S. spokeswoman, said in a statement on Wednesday. In November, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued an emergency order requiring that organizations with more than 100 employees require their workers to either be vaccinated against Covid-19 or be tested weekly and subjected to stricter face-covering requirements. The U.S.P.S. formally requested a variance from that order in a letter to OSHA dated Tuesday. “We are now in the middle of our peak season (mid-October through January), which is our busiest and most challenging time of year,” Deputy Postmaster General Doug A. Tulino wrote in the letter, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times. “The American people are relying on us to timely deliver their mail and packages throughout the holiday season — which aren’t limited to holiday packages but include critical items like Treasury checks, Covid-19 tests and pharmaceuticals.” He added that the mandate was “likely to result in the loss of many employees” just when they are needed most. Such a loss “would have a potentially catastrophic impact on our ability to provide service to the American public when demand is at its highest,” Mr. Tulino wrote. The Postal Service requires all employees and contractors “who interact with the public” to wear face coverings “when there is a state, local or tribal directive in place that requires face coverings to be worn,” Mr. Tulino wrote. Face coverings are also required for employees and contractors who cannot maintain social distancing, he wrote.  Those policies apply regardless of a person’s vaccination status, he said. In the last 18 months, the Postal Service has received “only a handful of citations” related to pandemic restrictions, which, Mr. Tulino wrote, “illustrates that the Postal Service’s established Covid-19 mitigation measures have been extremely successful to date.”   Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York said she would ask the State Legislature to make the sale of drinks to go at bars and restaurants legal, cementing in law a popular emergency policy that helped the battered hospitality industry weather the first year and a half of the pandemic. In her annual state of the state address, Governor Hochul said that legalizing to-go drinks was “something our bars and restaurants have been asking for” because it was “a critical revenue stream during the lean times last year.” Her aides said she would send a bill to the Legislature during the current session. She added, “Cheers, New York.” The previous governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, had used his emergency powers during the first year of the pandemic to put in place a special “off-premises privileges” rule allowing to-go alcohol sales. The measure was intended to throw a lifeline to the struggling food and beverage industry. Customers quickly grew accustomed to the convenience of takeout drinks. But the rule died when the state of emergency ended last June and the Legislature did not pass a measure that would extend it. Several other states, including Iowa and Arizona, have legalized the sale of takeout alcohol during the pandemic. Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, welcomed the news that Ms. Hochul would push for legislative action on the issue this year. “The drinks to go policy provides critically important revenue streams to struggling restaurants and bars and is extraordinarily popular with the public, unsurprisingly,” he said in a statement. Mr. Rigie added, “We commend Governor Hochul for her leadership, and we look forward to toasting her administration and the State Legislature once this important policy is reinstated.” The announcement on Wednesday came as the highly contagious Omicron variant has driven cases to record highs in New York State. New daily cases were averaging more than 66,000 by Jan. 4, according to a New York Times database. The Italian government made Covid-19 vaccination mandatory for people 50 and older on Wednesday, as it sought to curb the explosive growth in new cases because of the Omicron variant. The government also approved rules that prevent the unvaccinated from entering businesses, including banks, post offices and some stores. Previously, workers older than 50 could show proof of a negative test to do their jobs. Now they will have to be vaccinated or show proof they have recovered from an infection. The measures go into effect on Feb. 15. “We want to curb the growth of infections and push the Italians who haven’t gotten vaccinated yet to do so,” Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, said in a statement on Wednesday. “We are targeting in particular age groups that are at higher risk of being hospitalized to reduce the pressure on hospitals and save lives.” Mr. Draghi added that the government’s goal was to keep hospitals working while, at the same time, keeping schools and businesses open. With new infections rising fast, scientists fear that hospitals may soon have to shut down regular activities to devote beds and personnel to Covid patients. Almost 7 percent of Italians over 50 are estimated to have not received any vaccination yet. Vaccination rates are high in Italy, the first country outside China to be severely hit by the pandemic. But there still are millions of unvaccinated people. The government also set aside 92.5 million euros, or about $104.6 million, for free rapid testing in schools to lessen the effect of the virus and avoid the huge use of remote learning, said the education minister, Patrizio Bianchi. A small, new real-world study suggests that two widely used at-home antigen tests, the Abbott BinaxNOW and Quidel QuickVue, may fail to detect some Omicron infections even when people are carrying high levels of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, focused on 30 people infected with the virus at five workplaces that experienced what were most likely outbreaks of the Omicron variant in December. The people received both saliva-based P.C.R. tests and rapid antigen tests using nasal swabs. It took three days, on average, for people to test positive on a rapid antigen test after their first positive P.C.R. result. In four cases, people transmitted the virus to others while the rapid test showed the negative result, according to the study, which was conducted by several members of the Covid-19 Sports and Society Working Group. It is not clear whether the infections were missed because the antigen tests are inherently less sensitive to Omicron or because saliva tests may be better at detecting the new variant. But the results are consistent with other preliminary evidence that the at-home tests that many Americans have come to rely on — at least as currently administered, with a nasal swab — may fail to detect some Omicron cases in the first days of infection. The researchers said they shared their results with federal officials — including at the White House, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — in real-time, as the outbreaks were occurring last month. The study comes a week after the Food and Drug Administration released its own update on the effectiveness of the rapid antigen tests. “Early data suggests that antigen tests do detect the Omicron variant but may have reduced sensitivity,” the agency said. President Biden’s coronavirus response coordinator said Wednesday that, beginning next week, Americans struggling to get tested for the coronavirus will be able to have the cost of rapid at-home tests reimbursed by their insurers, but offered no specific promises about when free tests would be available. The remarks by Jeff Zients, who leads the White House pandemic response, come two weeks after Mr. Biden said his administration would buy half a billion rapid tests to distribute free to the public, and that insurance companies would begin reimbursing people for tests they purchased on their own. Mr. Biden said at the time that the free tests would be available “in the coming weeks.” With the Omicron variant of the coronavirus fueling a sharp rise in cases across the country, demand for all kinds of tests is far outpacing supply. In some areas, people are waiting in long lines to take the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., tests that are administered at medical clinics. Rapid at-home tests are flying off pharmacy shelves. “We know this remains frustrating for people getting tested in many parts of the country,” Mr. Zients said on Wednesday. “So we are working to do all we can.” The administration’s new “test to stay” guidance for schools, in which students exposed to the virus can remain in the classroom if they test negative, is among the factors driving up demand for the rapid tests. Last week, when Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, omitted a testing requirement from new isolation guidelines, she was greeted with a chorus of criticism from public health experts who said a negative test should be required before an infected person ends a five-day isolation period. On Tuesday, the C.D.C. amended the latest guidance — not to say that testing was required, but to say that people who wanted to end their isolation periods after five days and had access to tests may choose to take them. If the test results are positive, they should stay home for another five days, the guidance says; if negative, and their symptoms are resolving, they may go out, but should continue to wear masks in public for another five days. Addressing reporters on Wednesday, Dr. Walensky said she omitted a testing requirement from the guidance because rapid tests are not authorized by the Food and Drug Administration to determine whether someone is infectious to others; they are authorized merely to detect infection, and are meant to be used serially, as is the case in schools. But after the guidance was released, she said, “it became very clear that people were interested in using the rapid tests,” and since that was the case, she at least wanted to “provide guidance on how they should be used.” The recommendation for the general public is different from the one for health care workers, who are required to test negative before going back to work. Dr. Walensky said the C.D.C. was always more conservative in its recommendations for health workers, because they care for vulnerable people, including those with weak immune systems. Matching testing supply with demand has been a challenge for both the Trump and Biden administrations. Early in the pandemic, there was a shortage of tests and the components that make up test kits. By late 2020, manufacturers had expanded production. But once vaccines arrived, the Biden administration put less emphasis on testing. Demand plunged, and manufacturers pulled back. Now the manufacturers are running at full speed again. Mr. Zients said manufacturers would begin delivering rapid tests kits to the federal government next week, and that the administration would set up a “free and easy system, including a website” where Americans could order them. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Wednesday that new federal testing sites would open this week in the District of Columbia and Philadelphia, followed soon after by Maine, Maryland, Nevada, Delaware, Texas and Washington state. She noted that mobile testing sites were already open in New York City and New Jersey. LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday scaled back restrictions on people traveling to England as the Omicron variant appears to be so widespread that measures tightened in November can no longer stem the spread. Starting Friday, vaccinated travelers will no longer need to take a test before their journey, Mr. Johnson said in a statement to Parliament on Wednesday. They will still need to take one within two days of arrival, he said, though a rapid antigen test is enough. As of Sunday, the government will not require a more expensive P.C.R. test. The changes were welcomed by the country’s hard-hit aviation industry. Mr. Johnson defended the stricter travel restrictions that were put in place in late November, when the Omicron variant was first identified, as necessary to slow its arrival. “But now,” he said, “Omicron is so prevalent, these measures are having limited impact on the growth in cases, while continuing to pose significant costs on our travel industry.” The decision announced Wednesday effectively takes Britain back to the same rules it operated in October. But unvaccinated passengers will still be required to take a pre-departure test and to self-isolate on arrival for 10 days, during which time they must take two P.C.R. tests. There were 194,747 daily cases recorded in the United Kingdom, according to data released on Wednesday, near the record of 218,724 cases announced on Tuesday. Mr. Johnson’s announcement covered England only, but Wales said it would take a similar step, and Scotland and Northern Ireland were expected to follow suit. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, an industry body, said the relaxed rules were a “hugely welcome move at a critical time in the booking season for passengers.” The change would, he said in a statement, “provide a massive boost to those wanting to travel abroad or come to the U.K. this year.” He added, “People will now be able to book knowing that, for the fully vaccinated, all emergency testing restrictions have been removed.” PARIS — Faced with a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant, President Emmanuel Macron of France said Wednesday that he wanted to “piss off” millions of his citizens who refuse to get vaccinated by squeezing them out of the country’s public spaces. By shocking the nation with a vulgarity three months before presidential elections, Mr. Macron was relaying not only a public health message, but also a political one. He appeared to be calculating that tapping into the growing public anger against the unvaccinated held more potential electoral rewards than the risk of angering an anti-vaccination minority whose support he has little hope of ever getting. Using his harshest language yet to urge the recalcitrant to get their shots, Mr. Macron said he would not “throw them in prison” or “vaccinate them by force.” But he made it clear he meant to make their lives harder. In doing so, Mr. Macron, an inveterate political gambler who became the nation’s youngest leader ever five years ago, effectively kicked off his campaign for re-election Wednesday, drawing clear lines between his supporters and opponents. He also moved the focus of debate away from themes like immigration and Islam that have dominated the political race so far and that are advantageous to his strongest rivals, on the right and far right. Mr. Macron was clearly seeking to tap into a rich political vein that his counterparts have been more cautious to exploit: anger among the majority of vaccinated people at a minority who refuse to get vaccinated and disproportionately occupy hospital beds. More than 77 percent of French people, and 92 percent of those 12 and older, have received at least two doses, according to the government. “The unvaccinated, I really want to piss them off,” Mr. Macron said, using a French word that is more vulgar, explaining that a new, reinforced vaccine pass would make it impossible for the unvaccinated to go to restaurants and cafes, or the theater and cinemas. Their recalcitrance, as well as the surge in cases in France, is threatening to undermine his success so far in tackling the pandemic. RIO DE JANEIRO — While Rio de Janeiro’s renowned Carnival parade will go on, the city will cancel its street parties, which ordinarily draw millions of revelers, the mayor says, citing the Omicron variant. The freewheeling public celebrations “won’t be possible,” Mayor Eduardo Paes Casaid at a news conference on Tuesday. “It’s been decided: there won’t be street carnival in the tradition of the past.” Mr. Paes said the official parade, in which samba groups put on elaborately choreographed shows flanked by bleachers that seat 56,000 people, would be held, with some health precautions. Last year, Carnival was canceled in its entirely because of the pandemic, but for many Brazilians, the real show is the street parties, and Cariocas, as Rio residents are known, were devastated to learn that they would not take place. “I was very excited, very hopeful, for the 2022 Carnival, even more so after a year without Carnival,” said João Ramos, 26. Mr. Ramos, a designer, said that as soon as he read the news, he shared it with friends, who had already been discussing what costumes to wear. “It poured cold water on us, everyone was so sad,” he said. Still, Mr. Ramos said, the decision is understandable. Already the effect of year-end celebrations can be seen: The number of cases is ticking up again, after plunging for months. As Carnival approached, many Brazilians had begun cautiously rehearsing again, planning for that outburst of samba-fueled joy when they and millions of visitors take over public spaces and shake off the previous year’s sorrows. After two years of a pandemic, they said, it was sorely needed. “With most Brazilians fully immunized, we thought it was happening,” said Tatiana Paz, the organizer of one street performance group. “But then the situation worsened again, and there is nothing we can do about it.” Other major cities such as Olinda, São Luís, and Florianópolis have also canceled their carnival events in the past 24 hours. Rio canceled both the parade and the street parties in 2021, when Brazil’s death toll surged as its vaccination campaign was off to a slow start. But toward the end of the year, as shots became more widely available, Brazilians embraced them: About 68 percent of the country’s population is fully vaccinated, and the country’s caseload and death toll plunged. The period of relative calm that followed allowed the population to begin socializing again. Streets, beaches, and bars became packed as summer set in. On Copacabana beach, the sky was filled with fireworks as onlookers welcomed the New Year.  However, cases started rising again as Omicron spread around the world. Rio’s annual Carnival, considered to be one of the largest in the world, takes place in the weeks leading up to Ash Wednesday, the Western Christian holy day that marks the start of Lent. Ash Wednesday falls on March 2 this year. The city’s tradition, with its lively music and elaborate costumes, has endured and often thrived even in difficult times. Brazilians have danced through wars, hyperinflation, repressive military rule, runaway street violence and the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic. Official calls to postpone Carnival in Brazil in 1892 (for sanitation reasons) and 1912 (to mourn the death of a national hero) were largely ignored. In another city famous for Carnival, New Orleans, this year’s Mardi Gras parades appear to be moving forward. The event was canceled in 2021. For the second year in a row, the Grammy Awards have been pushed back by the coronavirus pandemic. The 64th annual ceremony, which had been set for Jan. 31 in Los Angeles, has been rescheduled, according to a joint statement on Wednesday from the Recording Academy and CBS, as the Omicron variant has led to a surge in cases nationwide. The new date will be announced soon, the statement said, noting, “The health and safety of those in our music community, the live audience, and the hundreds of people who work tirelessly to produce our show remains our top priority.” Last year’s show was postponed by six weeks as cases spiked, and before vaccinations were widely available. Last week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, predicted that the latest wave of the pandemic may reach its peak in the United States by the end of January. This year the composer and bandleader Jon Batiste has 11 Grammy nominations, more than any other artist, and will compete for both album and record of the year. Other top nominees include Olivia Rodrigo, Justin Bieber, Billie Eilish and Doja Cat. No performers have been announced yet. Gov. Kathy M. Hochul of New York said Wednesday that she would propose spending $10 billion to help rebuild a health care work force that has been exhausted and depleted by the nearly two-year-old pandemic. “We simply do not have enough health care workers in our hospitals, or in our long-term care facilities, in our ambulances, or in the homes of our loved ones,” the governor said in her first State of the State speech in Albany, labeling the moment a crisis.  The state health work force is about 6 percent smaller than it was before the pandemic. Even before the coronavirus strained the system, officials had projected the work force would need to grow by 11 percent by the end of 2022 to meet demand, the governor’s office reported. “We must stop the current hemorrhaging of health care workers,” Ms. Hochul said in her speech. “And we’re going to do it. Not just by saying we owe them a debt of gratitude, but actually paying them the debt we owe.” She proposed spending more than $4 billion to support wages and bonuses to increase the number of health care workers in the state by 20 percent over the next five years. That would include up to $3,000 in bonuses for all full-time health care workers who remain in their positions for a year, and $2 billion in spending on health care capital infrastructure and improved lab capacity. The governor also wants to offer free tuition to students who are preparing to work in high-demand health occupations and to provide stipends to make up for lost income while they are in school. Doctors could receive loan forgiveness up to $120,000 if they work in underserved areas for three years. She also wants to start a “Nurses Across N.Y.” Program to place nurses in underserved areas. Hospitals across the state are reporting that staffing is the biggest challenge of this stage of the pandemic, as new cases soared this week to levels not seen since the first wave in May 2020. The result has been packed emergency rooms and waits for beds at some institutions, though fewer patients are requiring intensive care because of vaccinations and what scientists say is the milder nature of the Omicron variant. As the governor spoke in Albany, the new mayor of New York, Eric Adams, laid out a plan to provide $111 million in new funding for the city’s public hospitals to help them cope with the surge in patients caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant. He also announced a $27 million loan program for the city’s so-called safety-net hospitals, which are outside the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation network. A small, new real-world study suggests that two widely used at-home antigen tests, the Abbott BinaxNow and Quidel QuickVue, may fail to detect Omicron infections when people are carrying high levels of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, focused on 30 people, who were most likely infected with Omicron, who tested positive for the virus at workplace surveillance programs. They took both saliva-based P.C.R. tests and rapid antigen tests using nasal swabs. It took three days, on average, for people to test positive on a rapid antigen test after their first positive P.C.R. result. In four cases, people transmitted the virus to others while the rapid test showed the negative result, the study noted. It is not clear whether the infections were missed because the antigen tests are inherently less sensitive for Omicron or because saliva samples may be a better way to detect the new variant. But the results suggest that the at-home tests that many Americans have come to rely on — at least as currently administered, with a nasal swab — may be failing to detect Omicron in the first days of infection. Anne Wyllie, a microbiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and a co-author of the study, urged people to interpret negative test results with caution. “People should not ignore high risk exposures,” she said. “They should not ignore symptoms.” Rapid antigen tests, which are designed to detect proteins on the surface of the coronavirus, have always been less sensitive than P.C.R. tests, which amplify the virus’s genetic material and can detect even very small traces of the virus. But in the new study, the rapid antigen tests failed to detect the virus even in people who had high viral loads, and who were thus likely to be infectious. The tests were done over a series of up to 10 days. The discordant results overwhelmingly came during the first three days of infection. The study, by researchers at the University of Washington, the Yale School of Public Health and others, concluded: “In real-world antigen testing, the limit of detection was substantially lower than manufacturers have reported to the F.D.A. based on laboratory validation.” In 29 of 30 people, samples of the virus produced a telltale genetic pattern on P.C.R. tests, suggesting that they were likely infected with Omicron. Although the study is small and has not yet been reviewed by experts, it fits with emerging research suggesting that some rapid antigen tests may be less sensitive to Omicron than to other variants. It is also consistent with a recent report from South Africa, which suggests that saliva samples might be a better way to detect Omicron than nasal swabs. The study comes a week after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released an update that made headlines by stating: “Early data suggests that antigen tests do detect the omicron variant but may have reduced sensitivity.” An Abbott spokesman, John Koval, said on Wednesday that the finding that a P.C.R. test is more sensitive is “not new.”  “Due to immediate turnaround time, frequent rapid antigen testing does slow transmission — and with a highly infectious variant frequent testing is needed, which is not realistic with P.C.R.,” he wrote in an email. Quidel’s president, Douglas Bryant, said in a statement that the company performed recent testing using samples from South Africa and confirmed that its rapid tests are detecting the Omicron variant. “The QuickVue antigen tests are able to detect the live Omicron variant with similar performance as with other variants,” he said. Hong Kong announced a series of strict pandemic control measures on Wednesday, including suspending flights from the United States and seven other countries, as it scrambled to contain an incipient coronavirus outbreak. The new measures came as the authorities held thousands of passengers of a cruise ship under mandatory quarantine to trace a Covid case. The flight bans will deepen the city’s isolation from the outside world and mark a return to the tough restrictions the city imposed in the early days of the pandemic. Hong Kong has largely brought the coronavirus under control, but the arrival of the highly transmissible Omicron variant threatens to set off the city’s fifth wave of the pandemic. “Given the very dire situation of the pandemic, we have to grasp this critical moment,” Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said at a news conference. Mrs. Lam had said on Tuesday that no new social distancing measures were expected. But the spread of Omicron, including the infection of a person with no clear connections to the city’s first detected Omicron cluster, evidently forced a change. “We have to contain the pandemic to make sure there will not be a major outbreak in the community again,” she said. “We are racing with Omicron.” The restrictions will make it even harder to enter Hong Kong, which already imposes some of the world’s longest quarantines — up to three weeks. Under the new rules, no flights will be allowed from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines or United States for two weeks, starting on Saturday. People who have recently been in those countries will also be barred from entering Hong Kong by other routes. Large public events will be canceled, and several types of public venues — including bars, gyms and karaoke parlors — will be closed. Visitors will be barred from hospitals and nursing homes for two weeks. Dining in restaurants after 6 p.m. will be banned. But the government decided not to stop in-person instruction in schools, or to require government officials to work from home. Hong Kong has reported a growing number of imported cases involving the Omicron variant, with 133 as of Tuesday.  “If this continues, there will be tremendous strain on our quarantine and health care facilities,” said Dr. Ronald Lam, Hong Kong’s director of health. An Omicron outbreak in the city has been traced to a Cathay Pacific flight attendant who ignored quarantine requirements after returning to the city from the United States. He dined at the Moon Palace restaurant in the upscale Fashion Walk shopping mall on Dec. 27, infecting his father and at least one other person, who then infected others. The restrictions came as Hong Kong health authorities on Wednesday ordered a Royal Caribbean cruise ship to return to port early as officials searched for the contacts of a Covid-19 patient. Nine people who boarded the ship, the Spectrum of the Seas, on Jan. 2 had come into contact with the patient, who did not board the ship, the government said in a statement. The nine were told to quarantine as soon as they were identified as contacts, though they preliminarily tested negative. The vessel, which was carrying about 2,500 guests and 1,200 staff members, was scheduled to return on Thursday but was back in port as ordered on Wednesday morning, a Royal Caribbean representative said. More than 3,000 passengers of the ship were subjected to mandatory quarantine, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said at a news conference on Wednesday. All crew members and guests 12 and older had to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and provide negative test results before boarding, the cruise line said in a statement. The passengers who sailed on the ship will receive a 25 percent refund on their cruise fare, it added. The cruise line also said that it had canceled another ship scheduled to depart on Thursday and that all guests who had booked it would receive a full refund. All nine of the justices on the Supreme Court have received booster shots of the coronavirus vaccine, a spokeswoman said. The justices have all been fully vaccinated since last March. The court is preparing to hear arguments on Friday in two major challenges to the Biden administration’s efforts to address the coronavirus in the workplace. As they have since the beginning of the current term in October, the justices will hear arguments on Friday in person in the Supreme Court’s courtroom. The courthouse remains closed to the public, and lawyers and credentialed journalists are required to wear N95 masks and to have recently received a negative test for the virus. The court does not require proof of vaccination. Friday’s arguments concern measures requiring vaccination or frequent testing of workers at large employers and vaccination of health care workers at facilities that receive federal money. The court will provide a live audio feed of the arguments on its website. The Sundance Film Festival announced Wednesday that it will cancel all in-person events set for Jan. 20-30. The news comes as virus cases are spiking because of the Omicron variant. The festival will now be virtual for a second year in a row. Sundance, in a news release, said it was “a difficult decision” to cancel its first hybrid festival, which would have allowed patrons to watch films either in-person in Park City, Utah, or online via a portal. The release noted that with case numbers expected to peak in Park City and the surrounding Summit County during the week of the festival, “we cannot knowingly put our staff and community at risk. The undue stress to Summit County’s health services and our more than 1,500 staff and volunteers would be irresponsible in this climate.” The news follows the announcement earlier today that the Recording Academy would postpone the Grammys, set to take place Jan. 31 in Los Angeles. In recent weeks, the Palm Springs International Film Festival canceled its event, and both the American Film Institute awards luncheon and the Critics Choice Awards, set for January, were postponed. Last year was the first time Sundance held a completely virtual event. The multiday affair was deemed a success considering the circumstances and generated one of the highest sales in the festival’s history when Apple paid $25 million for the film “CODA,” which is now looking for recognition in the awards race. The World Health Organization says that it is monitoring a coronavirus variant detected in a small number of patients in France, but that, for now, there is little reason to worry about its spread. The B.1.640.2 variant was first identified in October and uploaded to Gisaid, a database for disease variants, on Nov. 4. Only about 20 samples have been sequenced so far, experts said this week, and only one since early December. Abdi Mahmud, a Covid incident manager with the W.H.O., told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday that the variant had been on the agency’s radar since November, but added that it did not appear to have spread widely over the past two months. “That virus has had a lot of chances to pick up,” he said. By contrast, the Omicron variant, which was first uploaded to Gisaid on Nov. 23, has more than 120,000 sequences in the database. (The vast majority of Omicron cases have not been sequenced.) It has been detected in at least 128 countries, according to the W.H.O., and is fueling record-high case numbers in many parts of the world. Concerns over the variant in France arose after researchers found that it contained 46 mutations that differed from the original version of the coronavirus. Omicron also has a high number of mutations, which researchers believe made it far more transmissible. According to a research paper that was published on a preprint server in late December, but that has not been peer-reviewed, the B.1.640.2 variant was first detected in southeastern France in a vaccinated person who had recently traveled from Cameroon. Researchers found a total of 12 cases in the area and named the variant “I.H.U.,” after the research institute in Marseille that helped identify it. “It is too early to speculate on virological, epidemiological or clinical features of this I.H.U. variant based on these 12 cases,” researchers wrote. Numerous coronavirus variants have emerged over the past two years, and the reasons that some spread widely while others do not are complex. For now, several independent researchers say there is little reason to be concerned about the I.H.U. variant. Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College in London, tweeted this week that, so far, “this virus has had a decent chance to cause trouble but never really materialised.” After going virtual last year, CES, a mega-conference in Las Vegas that’s the traditional launchpad for many of the tech industry’s latest gadgets, is trying to make a comeback. The trade show kicks off on Wednesday, with an estimated 2,200 exhibitors set to show up in person. But with the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus surging, scores of major tech companies are still presenting mostly virtually. It’s a sign that decisions to hold big in-person events at this phase of the pandemic remain far from clear-cut, the DealBook newsletter reports. Yet the organizers of CES — like those of the Winter Olympics and the Australian Open, which are set to begin soon — have decided it’s time to gather in person again. Canceling the show would “hurt thousands of smaller companies, entrepreneurs and innovators” who depend on the show to introduce their products, Gary Shapiro, the chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, the trade group that organizes CES, wrote in an opinion column in The Las Vegas Review-Journal. (The conference is also important for Las Vegas, which reaped an estimated $291 million from spending tied to it in 2020.) Mr. Shapiro noted that the conference had embraced pandemic protections like requiring attendees to be fully vaccinated and masked while on the show floor, and that testing was readily available. But many large companies have chosen to attend remotely, including Amazon, AMD, AT&T, General Motors, Google, Intel, Lenovo, Meta, Nvidia, Pinterest, T-Mobile and Twitter. That will leave “big gaps on the show floor,” Mr. Shapiro said. And CES will end a day early, in what the organizers said was a concession to safety. Other big events are delaying their return to in-person gatherings. The World Economic Forum postponed its annual confab in Davos, Switzerland, which was set to take place this month. So is it safe to hold live in-person events again? Omicron cases appear to be less severe than cases from previous variants, and vaccines and new treatments are becoming available. More governments are also edging toward managing, not containing, the coronavirus, and are increasingly reluctant to reimpose restrictions. That could mean that a return to regular mass gatherings in some places may not be far-off. In hospitals around the country, doctors are taking notice: This wave of Covid seems different from the last one. Once again, as they face the highly contagious Omicron variant, medical personnel are exhausted and are contracting the virus themselves. And the numbers of patients entering hospitals with the variant are surging to staggering levels, filling up badly needed beds, delaying nonemergency procedures and increasing the risk that vulnerable uninfected patients will catch the virus. But in Omicron hot spots from New York to Florida to Texas, a smaller proportion of those patients are landing in intensive care units or requiring mechanical ventilation, doctors said. And many — roughly 50 to 65 percent of admissions in some New York hospitals — show up at the hospital for other ailments and then test positive for the virus. “We are seeing an increase in the number of hospitalizations,” said Dr. Rahul Sharma, emergency physician in chief for NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital. But the severity of the disease looks different from previous waves, he said. “We’re not sending as many patients to the I.C.U., we’re not intubating as many patients, and actually, most of our patients that are coming to the emergency department that do test positive are actually being discharged.” Though it’s still early for firm predictions, the shift in hospital patterns fits with emerging data that Omicron may be a variant with inherently milder effects than those that have come before, less prone to infecting the lungs, where it can cause serious disease. But the lower proportion of severe cases is also happening because, compared with previous variants, Omicron is infecting more people who have some prior immunity, whether through prior infection or vaccination. The vast majority of Omicron patients in I.C.U.s are unvaccinated or have severely compromised immune systems, doctors said. Hospitals, facing staff shortages, are under enormous strain. In New York City, hospitalizations have exceeded the peak of last winter’s surge. And Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, noting that the state had more hospitalized Covid-19 patients at that time than at any previous point during the pandemic. “We’re in truly crushed mode,” said Dr. Gabe Kelen, director of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s emergency department. The number of I.C.U. patients is a lagging indicator, likely to rise in the coming weeks, experts said. What’s more, some states are still struggling under the crush of hospitalizations from Delta, a previous version of the virus that may be more virulent. (Hospitals are frequently in the dark about which variant newly admitted patients are infected with.) NEW DELHI — When the Omicron coronavirus variant spread through India late in December, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged the nation to be vigilant and follow medical guidelines. Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of the capital region of Delhi, swiftly introduced night curfews, shut down movie theaters, and slashed restaurants and public transport to half capacity. Then, both men hit the campaign trail, often appearing without masks in packed rallies of thousands. “When it is our bread and butter at stake, they force restrictions and lockdowns,” said Ajay Tiwari, a 41-year-old taxi driver in New Delhi. “There are much bigger crowds at political rallies, but they don’t impose any lockdown in those areas. It really pains us deep in the heart.” As Omicron fuels a rapid spread of new infections through India’s major urban hubs, the country’s pandemic fatigue has been intensified by a sense of déjà vu and the frustration of mixed signals. It has been just a few months since the deadly Delta variant ravaged the country, when government leaders vastly underestimated its threat and publicly flouted their own advice. The memories of overwhelmed hospitals and funeral pyres working around the clock are still all too fresh here. The metropolis of Mumbai on Wednesday reported more than 15,000 new infections in 24 hours — the highest daily caseload since the pandemic began, beating the city’s previous record of about 11,000 cases during the second wave in the spring. In New Delhi, the number of daily infections increased by nearly 100 percent overnight. The sheer size of India’s population, at 1.4 billion, has always kept experts wary about the prospects of a new coronavirus variant. In few places around world was the toll of Delta as stark as in India. The country’s official figures show about half a million pandemic deaths — a number that experts say vastly undercounts the real toll. WASHINGTON — President Biden came into office vowing to restore public trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after the Trump White House had tied the agency’s hands and manipulated its scientific judgments on the pandemic for political ends. Yet in his first year, Mr. Biden has presided over a series of messaging failures that have followed a familiar pattern, with the agency’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, and her team making what experts say are largely sound decisions, but fumbling in communicating them to America. Dr. Walensky, a highly regarded infectious disease expert from Boston with no prior government experience, insisted in February that schools must keep students six feet apart; in March, she said three feet was enough. She said in February that teachers did not need to be vaccinated to reopen schools; the White House said the next day that she was speaking “in her personal capacity.” In May, she said that vaccinated people generally did not need to wear masks in public, a sudden change that flummoxed state health officials. Two months later, she reversed that guidance after it was shown that vaccinated people could still transmit the coronavirus. More recently, with the Omicron variant driving a near vertical rise in cases, Dr. Walensky alerted the White House that she planned to recommend that people infected with the virus isolate for five days instead of 10. To avoid another messaging fiasco, she briefed other top Biden health officials on her proposal so they would all be on the same page, according to two people familiar with her actions. But both Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, and Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, the surgeon general, took issue on national television with the agency’s policy of not requiring a negative Covid test before ending the shorter isolation. Dr. Tom Frieden, the agency’s director under President Barack Obama, said he did not believe the latest recommendations on isolation were significantly wrong, but “the way they were released was very problematic.” The crux of the problem, several administration officials said, is a failure by the C.D.C. and the Biden administration’s messaging experts to work in concert. Dr. Walensky’s critics say she is not collaborative enough, too often springing decisions on other federal officials who then struggle to defend them in public. Her defenders say that she strives to coordinate, but that it is not her job to ensure consensus across the entire administration. Some suggest the White House has gone too far in its hands-off, let-the-scientists-rule approach, leaving a vacuum of leadership and forcing ad hoc coordination between the various public health agencies. On the day President Biden was inaugurated, the advisory board of health experts who counseled him during his transition officially ceased to exist. But its members have quietly continued to meet regularly over Zoom, their conversations often turning to frustration with Mr. Biden’s coronavirus response. Now, six of these former advisers have gone public with an extraordinary, albeit polite, critique — and a plea to be heard. In three opinion articles published on Thursday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, they called for Mr. Biden to adopt an entirely new domestic pandemic strategy geared to the “new normal” of living with the virus indefinitely, not to wiping it out. The authors are all big names in American medicine. Several, including Dr. Luciana Borio, a former acting chief scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, and Dr. David Michaels, a former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration now with George Washington University’s School of Public Health, have held high-ranking government positions. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist, medical ethicist and University of Pennsylvania professor who advised former President Barack Obama, organized the effort. Like any White House, Mr. Biden’s prizes loyalty and prefers to keep its differences in house; in that regard, the articles are an unusual step. The authors say they wrote them partly because they have not made headway talking directly to White House officials. “From a macroperspective, it feels like we are always fighting yesterday’s crisis and not necessarily thinking what needs to be done today to prepare us for what comes next,” Dr. Borio said. The authors shared the articles with White House officials before they were published, but it was unclear whether the administration would adopt any of their suggestions. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, Mr. Biden’s top medical adviser for the pandemic, declined to comment on the articles. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters she had not read the articles, and dismissed a question about whether the president “is coming around to accepting” that Covid-19 is here to stay, even though several recent media accounts suggested that the administration was beginning to operate under that assumption. Mr. Biden’s recent emphasis on keeping schools open and businesses running even when cases are soaring also suggests a recalibration, as does a recent decision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend that people with Covid isolate for five days instead of 10."

Officials said eight children were among the dead. “This is without a doubt one of the most tragic days in our city’s history, the loss of so many people in such a tragic way,” Mayor Jim Kenney said at a news conference. “Losing so many kids is just devastating.” Jacuita Purifoy told reporters on Wednesday afternoon that the children were her nieces and nephews, and that three of her sisters had also died in the fire. One nephew, a 5-year-old, had survived and was in a hospital, she said. “He wants his mom, he wants his dad, he wants his sister, he wants his cousins,” Ms. Purifoy said. She described the sisters as close — even more so since the recent death of their father. As the sun set on Wednesday evening and bodies were being removed from the rowhouse, the victims’ family members gathered in a circle and said a prayer. Firefighters arrived at the building in the city’s Fairmount neighborhood, just north of Center City, about 6:40 a.m. to find “heavy fire” billowing from the second floor, officials said. It took 50 minutes to get the flames under control. Eight people fled from the building and two people, one of them a child, were taken to nearby hospitals, said Craig Murphy, first deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia Fire Department. The city had initially reported the death toll as 13, including seven children, but revised both figures on Wednesday evening. “I’ve been around for 35 years now, and this is probably one of the worst fires I’ve ever been to,” he said. “We plan on making sure that this tremendous loss of life did not happen in vain.” Mr. Murphy said the cause of the fire was under investigation. “We have all hands on deck because of the magnitude of this fire,” he said. The building was run by the federally funded Philadelphia Housing Authority, city officials said. Sumara Wright, 18, said one of the victims was a close friend and classmate. “I had just seen him two days ago riding his bike,” she said. She said that her friend and his siblings had been in the house on Wednesday morning. “We were close like family, we grew up together.” City leaders were visibly shaken by the horror of the fire, which had a death toll higher than the 2008 house blaze that killed seven people and the 1985 police bombing of members of the group MOVE, which killed 11 people and burned down 61 homes. At least four smoke detectors in the rowhouse where 12 people were killed on Wednesday did not go off during the fire, said Craig Murphy, first deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia Fire Department. He said that four smoke detectors were installed in 2019, and that there was another inspection in 2020. “When they went out that time, they installed two smoke detectors,” he said. Darrell L. Clarke, Philadelphia’s City Council president, said in an interview that investigators were still trying to determine whether any of the smoke detectors in the rowhouse had been working. “People, from time to time, they take the batteries out when they’re cooking,” he said, adding that larger public housing complexes in the city require hard-wired smoke detectors. The ones in the rowhouse were battery-powered, fire officials said. There were 26 people in the building at the time of the fire, including eight people on the first floor, Mr. Murphy said. “That is a tremendous amount of people to be living in a duplex.” Mayor Jim Kenney said the city does not run the federally funded Philadelphia Housing Authority, which managed the building. He urged the public to consider the circumstances that may have led to so many people staying in the building at the time of the fire. “Sometimes it’s better for people to be indoors than on the street,” Mr. Kenney said. “Maybe there were people or relatives that needed to be sheltered.” He added, “We can’t make judgments on the people in the house because sometimes people just need to be indoors.” Officer Eric McLaurin, a spokesman for the Police Department, said the fire quickly overwhelmed the rowhouse, which had been converted into two apartments. “You just pray for all involved,” Officer McLaurin said. “It’s a bad situation.” Laurie Roma woke to screams on Wednesday from the apartment building across the street. “When I looked outside,” Ms. Roma, 44, said, “I saw orange flames coming out of the second-floor windows, and there was a man screaming for help.” She heard someone shout that they had tried calling 911 but could not get through. Ms. Roma herself dialed at 6:39 a.m., she said, and no one answered the emergency line. “Someone ran with their own ladder down the street,” she said. “I think people were desperate to help.” Craig Murphy, the first deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia Fire Department, told reporters that he had not heard of people who were unable to get through to 911. Firefighters arrived two minutes after her call, Ms. Roma said, and worked quickly to suppress the blaze. Mario Mercado-Diaz, another tenant in Ms. Roma’s three-story apartment building, said he had often seen children who lived in the burned rowhouse playing on the street. Officials said eight children were among the 12 people killed in the blaze. “It’s a multigenerational family that lived there,” Mr. Mercado-Diaz said. “And they were good neighbors. I would say hi to them and they would say hi back, and they’re always very watchful of stuff going on.” Survivors of the fire that killed 12 people, including eight children, gathered at an elementary school about a block south of the scorched rowhouse on Wednesday morning. Cries could be heard from inside as a helicopter whirred overhead. One woman embraced another with a Salvation Army blanket draped around her and told a reporter she could not answer questions yet. “It’s too hard right now,” she said. Darrell L. Clarke, Philadelphia’s City Council president, said that several of the children who died were students at the Bache-Martin School, where survivors gathered. Mr. Clarke represents the Fairmount neighborhood where the fire took place. Shalai Young, a mental health technician who lives in Northeast Philadelphia, stood nearby, observing the damage. “When you see so many people lose their lives in one area, that’s tragic,” she said.Ms. Young said her work had brought her to the neighborhood before, which she described as “family oriented.” Dozens of firefighters and police officers milled around the rowhouse near the corner of 23rd and Parrish Streets in the Fairmount neighborhood, north of Center City. Many windows had been smashed out and were blackened by rings of soot. By late afternoon, a fire truck remained parked in front of the burned house, with its ladder extended toward the building. A large yellow tarp was draped over it to block the view of the building’s entrance, as firefighters removed the bodies of victims. Ms. Young said she was hoping to help the family and any neighbors displaced by the blaze, starting with “the necessities.” “In a fire, you lose things that we take for granted every day, you know, shoes, socks, blankets, pajamas, toiletries,” she said. “Anything, any way I can help.” Mr. Clarke, the City Council president, said his office had been flooded with offers of resources for the victims of the fire. “It’s a tightknit community,” he said. “The outpouring of support is encouraging.” Five children were killed in a fire at a day care center in a two-story house in Erie, Pa. The city’s fire chief said the house had only one smoke detector — in the attic — and had overloaded extension cords running beneath a couch. The victims ranged in age from 9 months to 14 years old and were sleeping upstairs in the two-story house when the fire was reported. Ten children died when a fire broke out in an apartment building in the Little Village section of Chicago. The children were attending a sleepover at the time. The building’s owner was cited with more than 40 building code violations. Thirteen people died when a five-alarm fire engulfed an apartment building in the Bronx, the deadliest blaze in New York City in more than a quarter of a century. The fire started when a 3-year-old boy was playing with the burners of a stove, the authorities said at the time. A hot plate warming food for the Sabbath sparked a fire that tore through the Brooklyn home of an Orthodox Jewish family, killing seven children. There were no smoke detectors on the first floor of the home where the fire broke out or on the second floor where the family members had been sleeping. Ten people, including eight children, were killed when a fire swept through a home in Brockway, Pa., a rural town about 100 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. The victims ranged in age from 4 months to 40 years old. A Christmas Eve fire at a high-rise hotel that had been converted into apartments for seniors in Johnson City, Tenn., killed 16 people, including 14 residents. The fire, which started in the living room of one of the apartments, injured 30 people, including 15 firefighters. A police helicopter dropped a bomb on a rowhouse in West Philadelphia where members of the communal, anti-government group MOVE lived, an action that the City Council apologized for in 2020 after decades of intense criticism. Eleven people, including five children, were killed, and more than 60 nearby homes were destroyed by the fire. A man with a lengthy criminal record and a history of mental illness intentionally started a fire in an apartment building in Waterbury, Conn., after an argument with a niece who lived there. The fire killed 14 people and displaced more than 100 residents. The man was sentenced to two consecutive life terms for the deadly arson. Smoke detectors in the two apartments where 12 people were killed in a fire on Wednesday morning were last inspected in 2021, according to the Philadelphia Housing Authority, the federally funded agency that runs the building. There were four smoke detectors in the building that did not operate during the fire in the city’s Fairmount neighborhood, Craig Murphy, first deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia Fire Department, said on Wednesday morning. Dinesh Indala, executive vice president of housing operations at the Philadelphia Housing Authority, told reporters at the scene of the fire that he did not know what caused the smoke detectors to stop working between inspections in 2021 and the fire on Wednesday morning. He said it was also unclear why 26 people were in the building, where two families lived. “It’s the holidays, I don’t know if they had people coming and visiting, I have no idea,” Mr. Indala said. He said that the most recent inspection of the B unit of the building was on May 5, 2021, and that six smoke detectors and three carbon monoxide monitors were working at the time. The agency replaced smoke detectors in the unit during an inspection in September 2019, he added. The last inspection of the A unit was on April 23, 2021, and seven smoke detectors and three carbon monoxide monitors were in the apartment and another two were installed, Mr. Indala said. He said the property has been owned by the Philadelphia Housing Authority since the 1960s. According to the agency, more than 80,000 people in Philadelphia live in its homes. Mr. Murphy, the Fire Department official, said there had also been an inspection in 2020. Mr. Indala said that the housing authority inspected its properties annually, and that a priority in those inspections was checking smoke detectors and carbon monoxide monitors. If people living in one of the housing authority’s homes have issues with these devices, he said, they should contact the agency immediately and will receive a response within 24 hours. Philadelphia’s leaders mourned the deaths of four adults and eight children in a rowhouse fire on Wednesday, struggling to put their grief into words in the aftermath of the blaze. Mayor Jim Kenney called the fire “tragic” at a news conference outside the burned-out rowhouse, in the city’s Fairmount neighborhood. “I don’t have much more to say than please keep all these folks, and especially these children, in your prayers,” he said. Mr. Kenney, whose father was a firefighter, later recalled how fires that killed children left his own family grieving in their aftermath. His father, he said, “would basically lock himself in his bedroom for a couple of days and my mother would say, basically, ‘Don’t go near the door.’” Fire Department leaders were similarly emotional as they described what firefighters found once they were able to enter the building. “It was terrible,” said Craig Murphy, first deputy fire commissioner. “I’ve been around for 35 years now and this is probably one of the worst fires I have ever been to.” He added, shaking his head: “I don’t have the words for how we’re feeling right now as a community and as a Fire Department.” Darrell L. Clarke, the president of the City Council, said the city would try to learn from the fire and what led to the tragedy. “This just punched you in the gut,” he said. City Council members called for accountability, though the cause of the fire was not immediately clear. “We must learn from what occurred here to prevent it from happening again,” one member, Jamie Gauthier, wrote on Twitter. “This is an immensely dark day for Philadelphia,” another council member, Kendra Brook, said. “We must get to the root cause of this horrific tragedy so that it never happens again.”"

Tres días después, se enfermó de COVID-19, una de las 2000 personas que se contagiaron como consecuencia del evento de dos días. “Lo hicimos muy bien; seguimos las reglas”, dijo Delgado, diseñadora de interiores de 53 años. “Seguimos la orden de usar cubrebocas. Nuestra tasa de vacunación era tan alta que bajamos la guardia. Cuando llegó la Navidad, dijimos: ‘¡Nos vamos de fiesta!’”. El concierto superpropagador contribuyó a que se produjera una explosión de casos de COVID-19 en Puerto Rico, que hasta entonces había estado llevando a cabo una de las campañas de vacunación más exitosas de Estados Unidos. El concierto formó parte de una serie de eventos de negocios, fiestas empresariales y reuniones familiares que impulsaron un aumento del 4600 por ciento de los casos en la isla, una oleada que los funcionarios de salud pública temían que se prolongase hasta entrado el nuevo año; la temporada de vacaciones puertorriqueña se prolonga hasta el Día de Reyes, el jueves. Aunque la variante ómicron ha asediado a todo el país, es especialmente preocupante en Puerto Rico, un territorio estadounidense ya abrumado por la bancarrota del gobierno, el éxodo de profesionales de la salud y un frágil sistema sanitario. Las autoridades impusieron una nueva oleada de restricciones estrictas a viajeros y comensales con la esperanza de frenar la nueva oleada de casos. Rafael Irizarry, un estadístico de la Universidad de Harvard que mantiene un monitoreo de datos de la COVID-19 en Puerto Rico, publicó en Twitter cifras desalentadoras: un tercio de todos los casos de coronavirus que la isla ha registrado desde el inicio de la pandemia se produjeron en el último mes. El número de casos por cada 100.000 residentes saltó de 3 a 225 en tres semanas. En diciembre, el número de hospitalizaciones se duplicó, dos veces. Sin la polarización política que ha plagado el debate sobre las vacunas en otras partes del país, casi el 85 por ciento de los habitantes de Puerto Rico han recibido al menos una dosis de la vacuna, y cerca del 75 por ciento se han puesto las dos vacunas. Sin embargo, ante una nueva variante altamente contagiosa, una tasa alta de vacunación ya no es tan significativa, explicó Irizarry. La mayoría de los puertorriqueños han superado el límite de seis meses a partir del cual la eficacia de la vacuna comienza a disminuir, pero al menos el 40 por ciento aún no ha recibido sus dosis de refuerzo, según las autoridades sanitarias. En un momento dado, la semana pasada, el recuento de casos diarios había superado los 11.000, una cifra muy alta para una isla con solo 3,2 millones de habitantes. El aumento exponencial ha empezado a disminuir, pero el número de casos sigue creciendo, afirmó Irizarry. “La primera vez que noté que pasaba algo fue el 13 de diciembre y alerté al Departamento de Salud”, dijo. “Para el 14 y el 15, era obvio. Llamé al responsable de la base de datos y le dije: ‘¿Hay algún tipo de fallo en la base de datos?’”. El domingo había 317 personas hospitalizadas con COVID-19, de las cuales más de una cuarta parte son niños, según el Departamento de Salud de la isla. Es aproximadamente la mitad del número de personas que fueron hospitalizadas con la enfermedad en estas fechas el año pasado, antes de que tanta gente se vacunara. Pero sigue siendo un desafío para los hospitales. “El problema es que supongamos que la variante ómicron es la mitad de mala”, dijo Irizarry. “Si tienes ocho veces más casos, las matemáticas no te favorecen”. El gobernador Pedro R. Pierluisi ha ordenado reducir los aforos en los restaurantes. Para asistir a grandes eventos públicos, la gente ahora tiene que estar vacunada y presentar una prueba de COVID-19 negativa. Los pasajeros que lleguen en vuelos nacionales deben mostrar una prueba negativa realizada en las 48 horas anteriores a su llegada, sin importar su estado de vacunación. Ya existían normas similares para los vuelos internacionales. Se han cancelado eventos públicos masivos, incluida una importante celebración para conmemorar el aniversario 500 de la capital de la isla, San Juan. El programa “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve”, que la cadena ABC tenía previsto retransmitir en directo desde Puerto Rico ante multitudes grandes, se convirtió en un evento virtual. Después de que varias decenas de concursantes de Miss Mundo se enfermaron, la final del concurso en Puerto Rico se canceló. El jueves, la Coalición Científica, un grupo de científicos y profesionales de la salud que ha estado asesorando al gobernador, recomendó medidas aún más estrictas, como la limitación de la venta de alcohol y la reducción del horario de los bares y otros establecimientos. El viernes de la semana pasada, el gobernador siguió la recomendación y ordenó el cierre de los negocios entre la medianoche y las 5 de la mañana desde el martes 4 de enero hasta el 18 de enero. También ordenó que los empleados de los restaurantes y los trabajadores de seguridad pública recibieran vacunas de refuerzo. “Es un mensaje difícil de digerir cuando hace dos semanas las cifras de casos aquí eran de las más bajas del mundo”, dijo Daniel Colón-Ramos, profesor de la Universidad de Yale y presidente de la coalición. Las medidas resultan particularmente difíciles en Puerto Rico, dijo, donde no es despreciable la importancia de una temporada de fiestas que inicia en noviembre con el Día de Acción de Gracias y dura hasta el 6 de enero. Describió la época decembrina como “el 4 de julio más el Super Bowl”. “La Navidad es una semana en la que los puertorriqueños celebran su identidad”,dijo. “Celebran su familia. Celebran su fe. Celebran su herencia”. La edad promedio de las personas que se infectan en la isla es de 33 años, según las autoridades sanitarias. Sin embargo, a los expertos les preocupa que si los jóvenes que se infectan mientras asisten a fiestas y otros eventos visitan a los mayores para el Año Nuevo y el Día de Reyes, el número de personas mayores enfermas seguramente aumentará. Con tantos de sus jóvenes profesionales que se han mudado en los últimos años a Florida, Texas y otros estados, Puerto Rico tiene un porcentaje desproporcionadamente alto de adultos mayores, muchos de los cuales sufren de diabetes, obesidad y otros padecimientos que los ponen en mayor riesgo de complicaciones por el coronavirus. “Tenemos un sistema de salud que todos conocemos, y no es un secreto, es un sistema de salud que es frágil”, dijo Carlos R. Mellado López, secretario de Salud de la isla. Instó a la gente a la prudencia y a no saturar innecesariamente los centros de pruebas e insistió en que Puerto Rico tiene las herramientas necesarias, como los tratamientos con anticuerpos monoclonales, para combatir la crisis. No obstante, los expertos también advierten que miles de profesionales de la medicina han abandonado Puerto Rico en los últimos años en busca de mejores salarios, lo que podría complicar la capacidad de la isla para atender a un gran número de personas enfermas. La cantidad de médicos en la isla se ha reducido en 5000 desde 2006, y se prevé otro éxodo de médicos de atención primaria porque fueron excluidos de los recientes incentivos fiscales diseñados para evitar que los especialistas se fueran, señaló Víctor M. Ramos Otero, presidente del colegio de médicos de Puerto Rico. “El tema que tenemos no son las camas”, dijo Ramos. “El tema principal es el personal”. José R. López de Victoria, un epidemiólogo que participó en el diseño de las protecciones covid para los equipos de baloncesto de Puerto Rico, dijo que aún había una crisis en el panorama. “Por lo que estamos viendo en los centros de pruebas, esto no ha terminado”, dijo. “Van a ser dos semanas más. La expectativa es que la tasa de casos va a aumentar”."

His first, “Loyalties,” appeared more than three decades ago, in 1989. “Loyalties” was about growing up in an idealistic and radical family — his father, a union organizer, had been a member of the Communist Party in the 1940s — under constant surveillance and harassment from the F.B.I. His new one is subtitled “A Kid in the Newsroom.” It’s about how he fell in love with newspapering. As a teenager he was hired as a copy boy at The Evening Star, an afternoon daily in Washington, D.C. It was the moment when his future forked. He felt he’d been handed a ticket to the rest of his life. The “glorious chaos” and “purposeful commotion” of a good newspaper appealed to Bernstein on a primal level. He found a different kind of family at The Star. His own parents, in their idealism, had been distant figures. At the paper he discovered people who were “less complicated, less fraught.” He barely graduated from high school and dropped out of college. Newspapering required different habits of mind. Bernstein found “a haven in reporting, especially the way The Star went about it: proceeding without judgment or predisposition to wherever the facts and context and rigorous questioning led, to some notion of the truth in all its complexity. I liked that place. And the comfort and purpose it gave me.” When I learned, a few months ago, that a Bernstein journalism memoir was coming down the tracks, I marked it as a must-read. His Watergate reporting, with Bob Woodward at The Washington Post, brought down a presidency and inspired a generation of muckrakers. He was portrayed in movies by Dustin Hoffman and, less flatteringly, by Jack Nicholson. He was a dandy; he had top-flight hair. His lively bachelordom was well chronicled. He jilted the beloved Nora Ephron, who delivered a version of their short marriage in her novel “Heartburn.” He’s been a big beast of the media world for five decades. He’s forced to live the “Groundhog Day” nightmare of being asked, every time he turns around, if the latest outrage is “worse than Watergate.” At 77, he is entering his anecdotage. Who wouldn’t want to read about his sense of all these things, and to view his dashcam footage? That’s not what “Chasing History” is. The book tells the story of his journalistic apprenticeship at The Evening Star, the Pepsi to The Washington Post’s Coca-Cola, from 1960 to 1965. He was in his teens and early 20s. It ends before he gets to The Post, and long before he sets eyes on Woodward or Ephron. The result is a fond, earnest, sepia-toned book, the color of old clippings. It’s pretty good. I mean, it’s OK. It’s better than a sharp stick in the eye. It’s just … long and pokey and a bit underthought. I might not have finished it if my paycheck didn’t depend on leaving a clean plate. A lot happened in the world in the early 1960s, “Chasing History” reminds us: Russians in space; Bay of Pigs; the Cuban missile crisis; the March on Washington; John F. Kennedy’s assassination; the Beatles’ touchdown in the United States; the Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner murders in Mississippi; the Selma-to-Montgomery march. Bernstein was thrilled to feel a part of these events by osmosis, as those in a newsroom do, even if his role was mostly taking dictation from reporters in the field. He describes these historical events in detail, as if few had written about them before. He’s evocative about newsrooms themselves circa 1960: the books and papers, the gunmetal desks, the dirty Royal typewriters, the “hailstorms” of typing, the bulletins arriving, the printing press rumbling through the floor. He made himself useful. He learned by following the grizzled old guys — they were mostly guys — around. He learned to cover fires, to talk to cops, to take good notes, to carry shotgun rolls of dimes for pay phones. He’s good on the camaraderie he found. He was brilliantly hazed by a co-worker who told him, while Bernstein was wearing a beloved cream-colored suit, that he had to “wash” all the staff’s used carbon paper. The Star’s staff included big characters, like the columnist Mary McGrory. Bernstein found his own younger crowd, among them the journalist Lance Morrow. This cohort rented a rambling house together. “Working for The Star was a little like being part of a troupe of actors in a repertory company,” he writes, “all of us absorbed in the same project, all wrapped up in the stories, the work.” He continues: “We were smart, we never had enough money and we often had too much to drink.” His enthusiasm was infectious. If he’d been a dog, his head would have always been outside the car window. Bernstein attended the University of Maryland, but rarely went to class. There’s a measure of suspense in watching him try to avoid being drafted. He eventually joined an Army Reserve unit. It rankles the author still that The Star recognized he had talent and energy but would not hire him as a reporter because he didn’t have a college degree. This was during a period when journalism, long seen as quasi-blue-collar work, was being invaded by dapper young men from the Ivy League. “My view was that you might be better prepared by graduating from horticultural school than from Yale or Princeton,” Bernstein writes. “At least that way you could write the gardening column.” I was a cub reporter once, and journalism memoirs to me are salted peanuts. “Chasing History” lacks the parched wit of Russell Baker’s “The Good Times” and the shrewdness of Mencken’s “Newspaper Days.” It doesn’t have the gruff charm of Pete Hamill’s “A Drinking Life,” the omnidirectional belligerence of Michael Moore’s “Here Comes Trouble” or the sparkle of Molly Ivins’s remembrances, to name a few that come to mind. Had it run to 175 pages, “Chasing History” might have been a small classic. Bernstein makes journalism sound like what it is — a humble calling that can be a noble one.

Now, Mr. Tarantino is courting controversy — with a crypto twist — over ownership of the cult movie’s script that could set a legal precedent for intellectual property rights. On Wednesday, the director announced auctions of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, associated with his original handwritten screenplay, despite a pending lawsuit by Miramax. Mr. Tarantino has been thwarted before. In November, after he announced plans for an auction, Miramax sued, claiming breach of contract and various intellectual property violations. In December, the director’s lawyers denied the accusations, but the sales did not proceed. A hearing to schedule the lawsuit’s next steps is set for February, according to the court docket. Mr. Tarantino’s latest plans to sell the NFTs this month could prompt Miramax to demand an emergency block of the auctions until the legal issues are resolved. NFTs are chunks of code associated with images, sound or video files, recorded on the blockchain — think of them as digital certificates of authenticity. Miramax’s lawyers argue that NFTs are unique (“nonfungible” is in the name, after all). Mr. Tarantino’s legal team argues that he is merely reproducing copies of his original script, a right he reserved. How these tokens compare with old forms of creative expression is unclear. “Someone could mint hundreds or thousands of unique NFTs linked to the same creative work, kind of like printing many copies of a book,” said Frank Gerratana, an intellectual-property expert at Mintz in Boston. In that sense, although each one has its own unique identifier on a blockchain, NFTs may not be considered distinct. This question is likely to come up again, Mr. Gerratana said, given growing interest in cryptocurrencies. Whoever wins this fight may forever mark the law."

Ms. Cornish announced her departure on Twitter on Tuesday, saying she was “joining many of you in ‘The Great Resignation’” and adding that she was “ready to stretch my wings and try something new.” NPR said her last day will be Friday. Ms. Cornish, who started at NPR as a reporter on the national desk in 2005, has hosted “All Things Considered,” the broadcaster’s flagship news program, since 2012. “I look forward to new opportunities and new ways to tell stories and to keep finding ways to make space and center the voices of those who have been traditionally left out,” Ms. Cornish wrote on Twitter. Her decision to leave her job comes after the recent exits of other prominent NPR hosts of color, including the host Noel King, who went to Vox Media, and Lulu Garcia-Navarro, who joined The New York Times. Ari Shapiro, Ms. Cornish’s co-host on “All Things Considered,” said in a tweet on Tuesday that he was on vacation and not available for comment. He added that he would refer any journalists to NPR’s communications department for comment “on why we’re hemorrhaging hosts from marginalized backgrounds.” “If NPR doesn’t see this as a crisis,” Mr. Shapiro said in a tweet, “I don’t know what it’ll take.” Isabel Lara, NPR’s chief communications officer, said in a statement, “We’re focused not only on those who choose to leave NPR, but also who is deciding to come.” “Diversity in our staff, sourcing and coverage is not only crucial to the accuracy and fairness of NPR’s content, but to the future of public media and our audience at large,” she added. Speaking of Ms. Cornish, Ms. Lara said in the statement, “While we would love it if she could stay, she has decided to pursue new projects.”"

Officials said eight children were among the dead. “This is without a doubt one of the most tragic days in our city’s history, the loss of so many people in such a tragic way,” Mayor Jim Kenney said at a news conference. “Losing so many kids is just devastating.” Jacuita Purifoy told reporters on Wednesday afternoon that the children were her nieces and nephews, and that three of her sisters had also died in the fire. One nephew, a 5-year-old, had survived and was in a hospital, she said. “He wants his mom, he wants his dad, he wants his sister, he wants his cousins,” Ms. Purifoy said. She described the sisters as close — even more so since the recent death of their father. As the sun set on Wednesday evening and bodies were being removed from the rowhouse, the victims’ family members gathered in a circle and said a prayer. Firefighters arrived at the building in the city’s Fairmount neighborhood, just north of Center City, about 6:40 a.m. to find “heavy fire” billowing from the second floor, officials said. It took 50 minutes to get the flames under control. Eight people fled from the building and two people, one of them a child, were taken to nearby hospitals, said Craig Murphy, first deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia Fire Department. The city had initially reported the death toll as 13, including seven children, but revised both figures on Wednesday evening. “I’ve been around for 35 years now, and this is probably one of the worst fires I’ve ever been to,” he said. “We plan on making sure that this tremendous loss of life did not happen in vain.” Mr. Murphy said the cause of the fire was under investigation. “We have all hands on deck because of the magnitude of this fire,” he said. The building was run by the federally funded Philadelphia Housing Authority, city officials said. Sumara Wright, 18, said one of the victims was a close friend and classmate. “I had just seen him two days ago riding his bike,” she said. She said that her friend and his siblings had been in the house on Wednesday morning. “We were close like family, we grew up together.” City leaders were visibly shaken by the horror of the fire, which had a death toll higher than the 2008 house blaze that killed seven people and the 1985 police bombing of members of the group MOVE, which killed 11 people and burned down 61 homes. At least four smoke detectors in the rowhouse where 12 people were killed on Wednesday did not go off during the fire, said Craig Murphy, first deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia Fire Department. He said that four smoke detectors were installed in 2019, and that there was another inspection in 2020. “When they went out that time, they installed two smoke detectors,” he said. Darrell L. Clarke, Philadelphia’s City Council president, said in an interview that investigators were still trying to determine whether any of the smoke detectors in the rowhouse had been working. “People, from time to time, they take the batteries out when they’re cooking,” he said, adding that larger public housing complexes in the city require hard-wired smoke detectors. The ones in the rowhouse were battery-powered, fire officials said. There were 26 people in the building at the time of the fire, including eight people on the first floor, Mr. Murphy said. “That is a tremendous amount of people to be living in a duplex.” Mayor Jim Kenney said the city does not run the federally funded Philadelphia Housing Authority, which managed the building. He urged the public to consider the circumstances that may have led to so many people staying in the building at the time of the fire. “Sometimes it’s better for people to be indoors than on the street,” Mr. Kenney said. “Maybe there were people or relatives that needed to be sheltered.” He added, “We can’t make judgments on the people in the house because sometimes people just need to be indoors.” Officer Eric McLaurin, a spokesman for the Police Department, said the fire quickly overwhelmed the rowhouse, which had been converted into two apartments. “You just pray for all involved,” Officer McLaurin said. “It’s a bad situation.” Laurie Roma woke to screams on Wednesday from the apartment building across the street. “When I looked outside,” Ms. Roma, 44, said, “I saw orange flames coming out of the second-floor windows, and there was a man screaming for help.” She heard someone shout that they had tried calling 911 but could not get through. Ms. Roma herself dialed at 6:39 a.m., she said, and no one answered the emergency line. “Someone ran with their own ladder down the street,” she said. “I think people were desperate to help.” Craig Murphy, the first deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia Fire Department, told reporters that he had not heard of people who were unable to get through to 911. Firefighters arrived two minutes after her call, Ms. Roma said, and worked quickly to suppress the blaze. Mario Mercado-Diaz, another tenant in Ms. Roma’s three-story apartment building, said he had often seen children who lived in the burned rowhouse playing on the street. Officials said eight children were among the 12 people killed in the blaze. “It’s a multigenerational family that lived there,” Mr. Mercado-Diaz said. “And they were good neighbors. I would say hi to them and they would say hi back, and they’re always very watchful of stuff going on.” Survivors of the fire that killed 12 people, including eight children, gathered at an elementary school about a block south of the scorched rowhouse on Wednesday morning. Cries could be heard from inside as a helicopter whirred overhead. One woman embraced another with a Salvation Army blanket draped around her and told a reporter she could not answer questions yet. “It’s too hard right now,” she said. Darrell L. Clarke, Philadelphia’s City Council president, said that several of the children who died were students at the Bache-Martin School, where survivors gathered. Mr. Clarke represents the Fairmount neighborhood where the fire took place. Shalai Young, a mental health technician who lives in Northeast Philadelphia, stood nearby, observing the damage. “When you see so many people lose their lives in one area, that’s tragic,” she said.Ms. Young said her work had brought her to the neighborhood before, which she described as “family oriented.” Dozens of firefighters and police officers milled around the rowhouse near the corner of 23rd and Parrish Streets in the Fairmount neighborhood, north of Center City. Many windows had been smashed out and were blackened by rings of soot. By late afternoon, a fire truck remained parked in front of the burned house, with its ladder extended toward the building. A large yellow tarp was draped over it to block the view of the building’s entrance, as firefighters removed the bodies of victims. Ms. Young said she was hoping to help the family and any neighbors displaced by the blaze, starting with “the necessities.” “In a fire, you lose things that we take for granted every day, you know, shoes, socks, blankets, pajamas, toiletries,” she said. “Anything, any way I can help.” Mr. Clarke, the City Council president, said his office had been flooded with offers of resources for the victims of the fire. “It’s a tightknit community,” he said. “The outpouring of support is encouraging.” Five children were killed in a fire at a day care center in a two-story house in Erie, Pa. The city’s fire chief said the house had only one smoke detector — in the attic — and had overloaded extension cords running beneath a couch. The victims ranged in age from 9 months to 14 years old and were sleeping upstairs in the two-story house when the fire was reported. Ten children died when a fire broke out in an apartment building in the Little Village section of Chicago. The children were attending a sleepover at the time. The building’s owner was cited with more than 40 building code violations. Thirteen people died when a five-alarm fire engulfed an apartment building in the Bronx, the deadliest blaze in New York City in more than a quarter of a century. The fire started when a 3-year-old boy was playing with the burners of a stove, the authorities said at the time. A hot plate warming food for the Sabbath sparked a fire that tore through the Brooklyn home of an Orthodox Jewish family, killing seven children. There were no smoke detectors on the first floor of the home where the fire broke out or on the second floor where the family members had been sleeping. Ten people, including eight children, were killed when a fire swept through a home in Brockway, Pa., a rural town about 100 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. The victims ranged in age from 4 months to 40 years old. A Christmas Eve fire at a high-rise hotel that had been converted into apartments for seniors in Johnson City, Tenn., killed 16 people, including 14 residents. The fire, which started in the living room of one of the apartments, injured 30 people, including 15 firefighters. A police helicopter dropped a bomb on a rowhouse in West Philadelphia where members of the communal, anti-government group MOVE lived, an action that the City Council apologized for in 2020 after decades of intense criticism. Eleven people, including five children, were killed, and more than 60 nearby homes were destroyed by the fire. A man with a lengthy criminal record and a history of mental illness intentionally started a fire in an apartment building in Waterbury, Conn., after an argument with a niece who lived there. The fire killed 14 people and displaced more than 100 residents. The man was sentenced to two consecutive life terms for the deadly arson. Smoke detectors in the two apartments where 12 people were killed in a fire on Wednesday morning were last inspected in 2021, according to the Philadelphia Housing Authority, the federally funded agency that runs the building. There were four smoke detectors in the building that did not operate during the fire in the city’s Fairmount neighborhood, Craig Murphy, first deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia Fire Department, said on Wednesday morning. Dinesh Indala, executive vice president of housing operations at the Philadelphia Housing Authority, told reporters at the scene of the fire that he did not know what caused the smoke detectors to stop working between inspections in 2021 and the fire on Wednesday morning. He said it was also unclear why 26 people were in the building, where two families lived. “It’s the holidays, I don’t know if they had people coming and visiting, I have no idea,” Mr. Indala said. He said that the most recent inspection of the B unit of the building was on May 5, 2021, and that six smoke detectors and three carbon monoxide monitors were working at the time. The agency replaced smoke detectors in the unit during an inspection in September 2019, he added. The last inspection of the A unit was on April 23, 2021, and seven smoke detectors and three carbon monoxide monitors were in the apartment and another two were installed, Mr. Indala said. He said the property has been owned by the Philadelphia Housing Authority since the 1960s. According to the agency, more than 80,000 people in Philadelphia live in its homes. Mr. Murphy, the Fire Department official, said there had also been an inspection in 2020. Mr. Indala said that the housing authority inspected its properties annually, and that a priority in those inspections was checking smoke detectors and carbon monoxide monitors. If people living in one of the housing authority’s homes have issues with these devices, he said, they should contact the agency immediately and will receive a response within 24 hours. Philadelphia’s leaders mourned the deaths of four adults and eight children in a rowhouse fire on Wednesday, struggling to put their grief into words in the aftermath of the blaze. Mayor Jim Kenney called the fire “tragic” at a news conference outside the burned-out rowhouse, in the city’s Fairmount neighborhood. “I don’t have much more to say than please keep all these folks, and especially these children, in your prayers,” he said. Mr. Kenney, whose father was a firefighter, later recalled how fires that killed children left his own family grieving in their aftermath. His father, he said, “would basically lock himself in his bedroom for a couple of days and my mother would say, basically, ‘Don’t go near the door.’” Fire Department leaders were similarly emotional as they described what firefighters found once they were able to enter the building. “It was terrible,” said Craig Murphy, first deputy fire commissioner. “I’ve been around for 35 years now and this is probably one of the worst fires I have ever been to.” He added, shaking his head: “I don’t have the words for how we’re feeling right now as a community and as a Fire Department.” Darrell L. Clarke, the president of the City Council, said the city would try to learn from the fire and what led to the tragedy. “This just punched you in the gut,” he said. City Council members called for accountability, though the cause of the fire was not immediately clear. “We must learn from what occurred here to prevent it from happening again,” one member, Jamie Gauthier, wrote on Twitter. “This is an immensely dark day for Philadelphia,” another council member, Kendra Brook, said. “We must get to the root cause of this horrific tragedy so that it never happens again.”"

The heavy windstorms began on Saturday, and on Sunday 22,000 buildings were without power, the Matanuska Electric Association said on Facebook. About 2,000 buildings remained without power as of 8:45 a.m. Wednesday, the utility said. Gov. Mike Dunleavy declared the storm a state disaster on Monday, allowing families to apply for disaster-recovery grants. In addition to the windstorms, the cold weather, freezing rain and heavy snowfall had disrupted water distribution, damaged buildings and restricted travel. Steve Carrington, the mayor of Palmer, Alaska, a city of about 7,000 residents, said on Wednesday that more than 3,000 homes and businesses had lost power over the weekend, including his own. “You could definitely feel the house shaking,” Mr. Carrington said of the wind, which at times reached hurricane strength. His home had no electricity for three days, he said, adding that the wind ripped a chunk of his roof off and stripped an outer door from its hinges. “My wife would put her earbuds in and try to silence out the wind because it was just so constant,” Mr. Carrington said. Crews were delayed in restoring power because the winds have persisted for days. Meanwhile, as families endured without electricity, the wind chill was expected to dip as low as 35 degrees below zero on Wednesday, as it has in recent days. “This could cause dangerous life-threatening conditions for those without power, as frostbite can develop in as little as 15 minutes in these conditions,” the National Weather Service said on Tuesday. The Matanuska Electric Association, which has been chronicling updates on Facebook, said on Monday that it had been “a very rough evening with one step forward and two steps back at every turn for our crews,” who were removing trees, fixing equipment and restoring lines, but were slowed by the conditions. “With the wind continuing to cause damage even as they’re making repairs on existing damage, it makes it impossible to give a time frame,” the utility said on Monday. By Tuesday night, more than a dozen crews remained at work trying to restore power to the remaining customers, the utility said. At one point, the person writing updates on its Facebook page noted that it was “a balmy 54 degrees in my own house as I type this update!” A high wind warning was in place for the Matanuska Valley, which includes Palmer, Wasilla, Sutton and Chickaloon, through 6 p.m. Wednesday, the National Weather Service said. Winds were predicted to hover between 15 and 30 m.p.h., with gusts of up to 45 m.p.h. in the morning, and high temperatures expected from 5 below to 5 above, forecasters said. The American Red Cross of Alaska opened shelters in Wasilla and Palmer for residents without power, and “will remain open as needed or until the community power is restored,” it said on Tuesday on Facebook. Tyler Rutledge, the owner of Aurora Plowing, a small business in Wasilla, said on Wednesday that he had seen evidence of the storm’s destruction this week while driving through nearby towns: small planes flipped over, semitrailers splayed across icy roads, their wheels facing the white wintry sky. He said he saw buildings wrecked by wind and turned into dangerous debris, including a KFC and A&W restaurant, which the Wasilla Police Department warned residents to avoid. “Stop trying to get close to take pictures,” the department said on Monday. “Our officers vehicles are being hit with debris trying to keep people out of the way. Seriously. GO home and stay there.” On a recent trip for work, Mr. Rutledge, 36, said he felt the wind lift his truck slightly off the ground. Luckily, he said, he had thousands of pounds of rock and equipment in the back, which he believes prevented the vehicle from flipping. “It was a crazy storm,” he said. Adam Cardwell, 58, said that when he went outside on Sunday to remove the wind chimes that had been “rumbling and slapping” against his house, in Willow, “it was hard to walk” from the force of the wind. The lights flickered on and off that day, he said, but he never went a long period without power. Others weren’t as fortunate. Sabrena Combs, a member of the Palmer City Council who works as a community relations specialist at Matanuska Electric Association, said on Wednesday that a major concern was making sure residents without power had warm shelter because temperatures were expected to dip below zero this week. Side streets in Palmer were also covered with ice, making travel hazardous, she said. “It’s a scary situation,” Ms. Combs said."

The monthly expansion of the existing child tax credit expired last month after Congress failed to extend it. Since July, the federal government has sent the families of 61 million children monthly payments of $300 per child under 6, and $250 per older child. Democrats’ roughly $2 trillion Build Back Better spending bill, which would have renewed the expanded credit into this year, has not cleared Congress, and may never. When the policy first passed in March, many experts hailed its potential to cut child poverty and hunger, and many Democrats hoped regular cash in families’ pockets would prove wildly popular. But the public’s appraisal has been less glowing. While polls about last year’s expanded credit found it to be popular on net — most showed it with approval in the 50s — it lagged the popularity of lowering costs for prescription drugs, expanding Medicare and other policies Democrats are seeking to pass. As the party continues to debate whether and how to resurrect the expanded credit, polls generally suggest that Americans have reservations about making it a more lasting fixture of the social safety net. That lukewarm reception has dismayed those across the political spectrum who advocate more generous aid to families. “I have been kind of surprised that this has not been as popular as many of us expected that it would be,” said Brad Wilcox, a University of Virginia sociologist and senior fellow at the Institute for Family Studies, a conservative think tank. Why wasn’t it? Experts offered several theories, ranging from how the credit was passed to Americans’ deeply rooted beliefs about who deserves government support. One possibility is that the pandemic, which helped make the expanded credit a reality, has also limited its support. Democrats first passed the program as part of Mr. Biden’s $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill, framing it as a much-needed boon in a time when most Americans said they welcomed more robust action by the federal government. But at least so far, the pandemic does not seem to have fundamentally reordered Americans’ views about the role of government. As economic indicators improve and concerns about rising prices replace recession blues, the expanded credit may be a casualty of sliding public support for more federal help. A July Hill-HarrisX poll that described the program as a “pandemic stimulus measure” found that 60 percent of voters (including 47 percent of Democrats) thought it was “too expensive and no longer needed” compared with 40 percent who wanted to see it extended until 2025. As expected, Democrats support Mr. Biden’s expanded credit at far higher rates than Republicans, with independents about evenly split, but attitudes also vary across other dimensions. While younger Americans — who are more likely to be parents receiving the credit — tend to approve of it, many older Americans do not. That could be because they tend to view new expansions of the social safety net as threats to funding for Social Security, Medicare and other programs that benefit seniors, said Andrea L. Campbell, an M.I.T. political scientist who studies public opinion and social policy. Older Americans are also less likely to take care of children, which could further explain their tepid support. Benefits that aid Americans across their entire lives tend to outpoll policies like universal pre-K or the expanded credit, which help Americans only when they are raising children, notes Ethan Winter, a senior analyst at the progressive think tank Data for Progress and a pollster for Fighting Chance for Families, which advocates extending the credit. “There’s actually this nice correlation, if you look at all these items, between how long does this benefit support you during your life cycle and how popular it is,” he said. It may also be that the credit has proved underwhelming. Parents have largely spent the money on school expenses, food and other household costs, according to a survey conducted by the Census Bureau. Yet in an NPR/Marist poll released last month, just 15 percent of respondents who received payments said they had helped their families “a lot” compared with 64 percent who said “a little.” And although polls often find support for policies that benefit families and children, they may not be most Americans’ top priority. In a December Morning Consult/Politico survey, just 14 percent of voters said renewing the credit was among the most important elements of the Build Back Better spending bill. They ranked most of its other provisions — including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and funding for affordable housing — higher. It’s also possible that the expanded credit is struggling to overcome Americans’ deep-seated beliefs about who deserves government help and who does not. Broad evidence suggests many are skeptical of programs that provide cash without conditions. Parents who do not pay income taxes can access the credit. While many experts doubt the program nudges large numbers of recipients to leave the work force, some disagree — and polling suggests Americans overwhelmingly support work requirements for adults who receive government benefits in some or all cases. (Social Security and Medicare, nearly universal programs that Americans pay into via taxes before receiving benefits later in life, are rare exceptions, Professor Campbell said.) An August YouGov survey conducted for American Compass, a conservative think tank, found that increasing the value of the credit, making it available monthly and sending it to households without a working adult were all popular policy changes, but that sending it to nonworking families was the least popular of the three. And most Republicans, independents and voters without a four-year college degree whose households earn between $30,000 and $80,000 did not favor permanently sending payments to nonworking families. Proponents of the expanded credit counter that it was designed to reach a wider array of families, including those who stay at home to raise children. “What about the grandparents that are out there taking care of kids?” said Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat. “What about the disabled who have kids? Should they not get this?” Yet fears that some might abuse the credit may also be sapping support for it. In focus groups organized this year by the Institute for Family Studies, Mr. Wilcox’s think tank, even some participants who stood to benefit from the credit argued that others might spend it on vacations, have more children to maximize its value or become dependent on government support. Criticisms of unconditional benefits often stigmatize poorer Americans and single parents, or are influenced by racist tropes, as with the stereotype of the “welfare queen.” Yet the skepticism appears broadly held. “People wildly overestimate the amount of abuse and fraud in various kinds of social programs,” Professor Campbell said. “But it just strikes people as plausible.” Republicans, some of whom have attacked the expanded credit as “welfare,” have reinforced this notion for decades. But so have some Democrats. “This is something that’s been in our bones for a long time,” said Patrick T. Brown, a fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center who helped set up the Institute for Family Studies focus groups. Those ingrained attitudes could be limiting support for Mr. Biden’s credit. They may also explain why congressional efforts to extend it have failed so far. Senator Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat whose vote is most likely needed to pass any bill to do so, holds deep reservations about the program and has floated adding work requirements. Republicans in Congress unanimously oppose Build Back Better. While some — including Senators Marco Rubio and Mike Lee — support a more generous child tax credit, they have criticized Mr. Biden’s expansion because it lacks work requirements. Other Republicans argue that extending the credit long-term will increase the federal deficit. And some say it has helped drive inflation higher (many economists doubt it has played a big role). If Congress does not renew the expansion, the child tax credit will revert to its less generous, pre-Biden amount — no longer accessible to families who don’t work, and no longer available as advance monthly payments rather than as an annual credit. Many experts expect poverty, which affected about 16 percent of children in 2020, to rise. Polling is an imperfect gauge of public sentiment. Some Democratic pollsters have found higher levels of support for the expanded credit when it’s described as a tax cut for working families. If Congress does renew the program, tailoring it to critics’ concerns could boost its popularity. Some advocates of the credit propose more narrowly targeting it to lower-income families, which some polling suggests would increase its support. Others favor a monthly cash benefit for families administered through Social Security, as Senator Mitt Romney of Utah has proposed. Professor Campbell doubts tinkering is the solution. “The public does not know policy details,” she said. “They only know broad-brush aspects of these policies. And so tweaking policies on the margin, or thinking that a work requirement will make it more popular, I don’t think that’s a magic bullet.” Alternatively, a renewed credit might gain support if more Americans came to view it as a reliable plank of the social safety net. Although all but the wealthiest families are eligible for the expanded credit, language barriers, unstable housing and other hurdles appear to have made it harder for many Hispanic and low-income households to access it. Fixing those administrative burdens could grow the program’s constituency. Or perhaps a future political fight over the credit will reorient public opinion. The Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, did not become consistently popular until seven years later, when President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans tried and failed to repeal it. A record number of Americans have signed up for health plans through the law for 2022. Whether Mr. Biden’s child tax credit is renewed or not, any change in how the public feels about it will probably take time to emerge. “We’re only a few months into what I think is a pretty large natural experiment,” Mr. Winter said. “We might just have to wait and see.”"

It is brand-new and reinforced with a steel grate. Behind it, a start-up has built a multimillion-dollar testing and processing facility, getting ready to cash in on Germany’s next big wave: the possible legalization of marijuana. “Germany is traditionally conservative and has always been politically very cautious,” said Finn Hänsel, a founder of Sanity Group, the start-up that built the high-tech facility, where a dozen well-paid technicians in white coats use chromatography to test the makeup of imported cannabis plants. The company asked that the exact location of the farmhouse remain a secret for security reasons. The idea that marijuana could become legal “is still somehow unbelievable to me,” Mr. Hänsel said. Germany’s new government announced that it would legalize recreational cannabis for adults in its coalition contract presented in October. Although no bill or official schedule for a law exists yet, experts believe one will be passed within the next two years. Medical marijuana is legal in Germany, and small quantities of the drug for personal use were decriminalized years ago, but companies like Sanity Group are scrambling to make sure they are ready to supply a recreational market. “The legalization of cannabis is a paradigm shift,” Kirsten Kappert-Gonther, a medical doctor and Green member of Parliament, said in an email. “Anyone who would prefer to consume a hash cookie instead of an after-work beer in the future should be able to make that decision and stay on legal grounds.” Recreational marijuana is legal in a number of U.S. states and in a few countries, including Canada and Malta.  While the arrival of legal marijuana is being anticipated by businesses around Germany, Jakob Manthey, a scientist at the Center for Interdisciplinary Addiction Research at the University of Hamburg, warns of rash decisions. “A huge market is being created here and that could ultimately also be a reason — or an important factor — that will ultimately lead to the voices of scientists being considered less carefully than the voices of business interests,” he said in a recent interview. Although he approves legalizing marijuana, Dr. Manthey said Germany’s legal market — in Europe’s biggest economy — will have a signaling effect on the rest of the European Union, where several nations are slowly coming around to legalization; tiny Malta was the first. Lawmakers need to be aware of that bigger responsibility, he said. Mr. Hänsel co-founded his cannabis company in 2018 after successfully starting several conventional businesses. He said he saw a great business opportunity in legal cannabis. Right now, the work at the converted farmhouse is focused on the medical and wellness sectors, but it is set to scale up as soon as the recreational market comes online. Sanity Group said it has received more than 65 million euros, or about $73 million, in funding to date from international and national investors, including Casa Verde, Snoop Dogg’s investment fund; the musician will.i.am; the actress Alyssa Milano; a German soccer star; as well as more conventional investment funds. No one knows exactly how much can be made once weed goes fully legitimate. But a recent study estimated that legalized cannabis could generate nearly €5 billion annually in tax revenue and savings in policing. The study, led by Justus Haucap, an economist at the Düsseldorf Institute for Competition Economics, also estimates that legalization could create 27,000 new jobs. According to Professor Haucap’s research, the legal market could generate demand for 400 tons per year. Some lawmakers, though, insist that the main goal of legalization is not the state’s bottom line, but the societal danger of the drug if left unregulated. “We need to get cannabis out of the grungy corner,” said Andrew Ullmann, a medical doctor and American-born member of the German Parliament. Dr. Ullmann, who is a pro-business Free Democrat, is likely to help shape the law as a member of the health committee. One of the most important aspects is to ensure that marijuana is not sold to people under 18. “Our intention is to eliminate the black market,” he said. The plan is to sell cannabis in licensed distribution sites, where quality can be ensured, sales taxes can be collected and it can be kept out of the hands of minors. The most likely route, many say, is that pharmacies — which now dispense medical marijuana — continue to sell the drug. That would solve the problems of having to create and regulate a new commercial distribution system, as has been the case in many American states, or of not having enough government-licensed distributors, as was evident during Canada’s rollout. For Germany, known for its burdensome bureaucracy, legalization within two years would be a relatively quick change. But German start-ups say they will be ready and waiting. Stefan Langer, who uses medical marijuana to treat his A.D.H.D., founded Bavaria Weed. He bought one of the last Cold War bunkers to be built in Bavaria and installed a production line that is capable of packaging 20,000 individual doses a day. Keeping his business above board, which includes filing to both a medical authority and a controlled-substance authority, each with its own rules, is more than a full-time job, Mr. Langer said. Although some German companies grow their own plants, neither Sanity Group nor Bavaria Weed do. So they import the product from far-flung places like Portugal or Canada. All of it has to be licensed and documented for the German authorities.  Sanity Group’s lab at the former winery, which is dedicated to extraction and production, is kept under positive air pressure and is accessible only through a clean room. There, a team works out methods to more efficiently extract and better render THC, the cannabinoid responsible for the classic buzz, and CBD, the substance said to help relieve stress. In its current configuration, the processing plant can handle 21 tons of cannabis a year, according to the company. Sanity Group also built an 800-square-foot controlled-substance storage vault on the winemaker’s grounds. To satisfy historical preservation laws, the structure had to be wood-clad. Its security cameras and alarm system link directly to the local police station; its walls are armored and nearly a foot thick; and its heavy metal door would put a bank to shame. Germans appear to be coming around to the idea of legalizing marijuana. A recent survey by Infratest Dimap for the first time found more respondents, 49 percent, in favor of legalization than against it, 46 percent. In 2014, only 30 percent said they were in favor of legalization. Kevin Roth, a biopharmaceutical engineer who studied cannabis and is overseeing the building of the laboratory on the winery property, said there had been a shift from the stigmatization of marijuana after it was authorized for medical use. On a recent open-house day, the lab invited neighbors to come and see what was being done in their village. The employees were apprehensive at first but said they were met with much more acceptance than they had expected from the conservative rural community. “It turns out there are a lot of similarities between vintners and people in the cannabis business,” Mr. Roth said."

The B.1.640.2 variant was first identified in October and uploaded to Gisaid, a database for disease variants, on Nov. 4. Only about 20 samples have been sequenced so far, experts said this week, and only one since early December. Abdi Mahmud, a Covid incident manager with the W.H.O., told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday that the variant had been on the agency’s radar since November, but added that it did not appear to have spread widely over the past two months. “That virus has had a lot of chances to pick up,” he said. By contrast, the Omicron variant, which was first uploaded to Gisaid on Nov. 23, has more than 120,000 sequences in the database. (The vast majority of Omicron cases have not been sequenced.) It has been detected in at least 128 countries, according to the W.H.O., and is fueling record-high case numbers in many parts of the world. Concerns over the variant in France arose after researchers found that it contained 46 mutations that differed from the original version of the coronavirus. Omicron also has a high number of mutations, which researchers believe made it far more transmissible. According to a research paper that was published on a preprint server in late December, but that has not been peer-reviewed, the B.1.640.2 variant was first detected in southeastern France in a vaccinated person who had recently traveled from Cameroon. Researchers found a total of 12 cases in the area and named the variant “I.H.U.,” after the research institute in Marseille that helped identify it. “It is too early to speculate on virological, epidemiological or clinical features of this I.H.U. variant based on these 12 cases,” researchers wrote. Numerous coronavirus variants have emerged over the past two years, and the reasons that some spread widely while others do not are complex. For now, several independent researchers say there is little reason to be concerned about the I.H.U. variant. Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College in London, tweeted this week that, so far, “this virus has had a decent chance to cause trouble but never really materialised.”"

Officials said eight children were among the dead. “This is without a doubt one of the most tragic days in our city’s history, the loss of so many people in such a tragic way,” Mayor Jim Kenney said at a news conference. “Losing so many kids is just devastating.” Jacuita Purifoy told reporters on Wednesday afternoon that the children were her nieces and nephews, and that three of her sisters had also died in the fire. One nephew, a 5-year-old, had survived and was in a hospital, she said. “He wants his mom, he wants his dad, he wants his sister, he wants his cousins,” Ms. Purifoy said. She described the sisters as close — even more so since the recent death of their father. As the sun set on Wednesday evening and bodies were being removed from the rowhouse, the victims’ family members gathered in a circle and said a prayer. Firefighters arrived at the building in the city’s Fairmount neighborhood, just north of Center City, about 6:40 a.m. to find “heavy fire” billowing from the second floor, officials said. It took 50 minutes to get the flames under control. Eight people fled from the building and two people, one of them a child, were taken to nearby hospitals, said Craig Murphy, first deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia Fire Department. The city had initially reported the death toll as 13, including seven children, but revised both figures on Wednesday evening. “I’ve been around for 35 years now, and this is probably one of the worst fires I’ve ever been to,” he said. “We plan on making sure that this tremendous loss of life did not happen in vain.” Mr. Murphy said the cause of the fire was under investigation. “We have all hands on deck because of the magnitude of this fire,” he said. The building was run by the federally funded Philadelphia Housing Authority, city officials said. Sumara Wright, 18, said one of the victims was a close friend and classmate. “I had just seen him two days ago riding his bike,” she said. She said that her friend and his siblings had been in the house on Wednesday morning. “We were close like family, we grew up together.” City leaders were visibly shaken by the horror of the fire, which had a death toll higher than the 2008 house blaze that killed seven people and the 1985 police bombing of members of the group MOVE, which killed 11 people and burned down 61 homes. At least four smoke detectors in the rowhouse where 12 people were killed on Wednesday did not go off during the fire, said Craig Murphy, first deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia Fire Department. He said that four smoke detectors were installed in 2019, and that there was another inspection in 2020. “When they went out that time, they installed two smoke detectors,” he said. Darrell L. Clarke, Philadelphia’s City Council president, said in an interview that investigators were still trying to determine whether any of the smoke detectors in the rowhouse had been working. “People, from time to time, they take the batteries out when they’re cooking,” he said, adding that larger public housing complexes in the city require hard-wired smoke detectors. The ones in the rowhouse were battery-powered, fire officials said. There were 26 people in the building at the time of the fire, including eight people on the first floor, Mr. Murphy said. “That is a tremendous amount of people to be living in a duplex.” Mayor Jim Kenney said the city does not run the federally funded Philadelphia Housing Authority, which managed the building. He urged the public to consider the circumstances that may have led to so many people staying in the building at the time of the fire. “Sometimes it’s better for people to be indoors than on the street,” Mr. Kenney said. “Maybe there were people or relatives that needed to be sheltered.” He added, “We can’t make judgments on the people in the house because sometimes people just need to be indoors.” Officer Eric McLaurin, a spokesman for the Police Department, said the fire quickly overwhelmed the rowhouse, which had been converted into two apartments. “You just pray for all involved,” Officer McLaurin said. “It’s a bad situation.” Laurie Roma woke to screams on Wednesday from the apartment building across the street. “When I looked outside,” Ms. Roma, 44, said, “I saw orange flames coming out of the second-floor windows, and there was a man screaming for help.” She heard someone shout that they had tried calling 911 but could not get through. Ms. Roma herself dialed at 6:39 a.m., she said, and no one answered the emergency line. “Someone ran with their own ladder down the street,” she said. “I think people were desperate to help.” Craig Murphy, the first deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia Fire Department, told reporters that he had not heard of people who were unable to get through to 911. Firefighters arrived two minutes after her call, Ms. Roma said, and worked quickly to suppress the blaze. Mario Mercado-Diaz, another tenant in Ms. Roma’s three-story apartment building, said he had often seen children who lived in the burned rowhouse playing on the street. Officials said eight children were among the 12 people killed in the blaze. “It’s a multigenerational family that lived there,” Mr. Mercado-Diaz said. “And they were good neighbors. I would say hi to them and they would say hi back, and they’re always very watchful of stuff going on.” Survivors of the fire that killed 12 people, including eight children, gathered at an elementary school about a block south of the scorched rowhouse on Wednesday morning. Cries could be heard from inside as a helicopter whirred overhead. One woman embraced another with a Salvation Army blanket draped around her and told a reporter she could not answer questions yet. “It’s too hard right now,” she said. Darrell L. Clarke, Philadelphia’s City Council president, said that several of the children who died were students at the Bache-Martin School, where survivors gathered. Mr. Clarke represents the Fairmount neighborhood where the fire took place. Shalai Young, a mental health technician who lives in Northeast Philadelphia, stood nearby, observing the damage. “When you see so many people lose their lives in one area, that’s tragic,” she said.Ms. Young said her work had brought her to the neighborhood before, which she described as “family oriented.” Dozens of firefighters and police officers milled around the rowhouse near the corner of 23rd and Parrish Streets in the Fairmount neighborhood, north of Center City. Many windows had been smashed out and were blackened by rings of soot. By late afternoon, a fire truck remained parked in front of the burned house, with its ladder extended toward the building. A large yellow tarp was draped over it to block the view of the building’s entrance, as firefighters removed the bodies of victims. Ms. Young said she was hoping to help the family and any neighbors displaced by the blaze, starting with “the necessities.” “In a fire, you lose things that we take for granted every day, you know, shoes, socks, blankets, pajamas, toiletries,” she said. “Anything, any way I can help.” Mr. Clarke, the City Council president, said his office had been flooded with offers of resources for the victims of the fire. “It’s a tightknit community,” he said. “The outpouring of support is encouraging.” Five children were killed in a fire at a day care center in a two-story house in Erie, Pa. The city’s fire chief said the house had only one smoke detector — in the attic — and had overloaded extension cords running beneath a couch. The victims ranged in age from 9 months to 14 years old and were sleeping upstairs in the two-story house when the fire was reported. Ten children died when a fire broke out in an apartment building in the Little Village section of Chicago. The children were attending a sleepover at the time. The building’s owner was cited with more than 40 building code violations. Thirteen people died when a five-alarm fire engulfed an apartment building in the Bronx, the deadliest blaze in New York City in more than a quarter of a century. The fire started when a 3-year-old boy was playing with the burners of a stove, the authorities said at the time. A hot plate warming food for the Sabbath sparked a fire that tore through the Brooklyn home of an Orthodox Jewish family, killing seven children. There were no smoke detectors on the first floor of the home where the fire broke out or on the second floor where the family members had been sleeping. Ten people, including eight children, were killed when a fire swept through a home in Brockway, Pa., a rural town about 100 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. The victims ranged in age from 4 months to 40 years old. A Christmas Eve fire at a high-rise hotel that had been converted into apartments for seniors in Johnson City, Tenn., killed 16 people, including 14 residents. The fire, which started in the living room of one of the apartments, injured 30 people, including 15 firefighters. A police helicopter dropped a bomb on a rowhouse in West Philadelphia where members of the communal, anti-government group MOVE lived, an action that the City Council apologized for in 2020 after decades of intense criticism. Eleven people, including five children, were killed, and more than 60 nearby homes were destroyed by the fire. A man with a lengthy criminal record and a history of mental illness intentionally started a fire in an apartment building in Waterbury, Conn., after an argument with a niece who lived there. The fire killed 14 people and displaced more than 100 residents. The man was sentenced to two consecutive life terms for the deadly arson. Smoke detectors in the two apartments where 12 people were killed in a fire on Wednesday morning were last inspected in 2021, according to the Philadelphia Housing Authority, the federally funded agency that runs the building. There were four smoke detectors in the building that did not operate during the fire in the city’s Fairmount neighborhood, Craig Murphy, first deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia Fire Department, said on Wednesday morning. Dinesh Indala, executive vice president of housing operations at the Philadelphia Housing Authority, told reporters at the scene of the fire that he did not know what caused the smoke detectors to stop working between inspections in 2021 and the fire on Wednesday morning. He said it was also unclear why 26 people were in the building, where two families lived. “It’s the holidays, I don’t know if they had people coming and visiting, I have no idea,” Mr. Indala said. He said that the most recent inspection of the B unit of the building was on May 5, 2021, and that six smoke detectors and three carbon monoxide monitors were working at the time. The agency replaced smoke detectors in the unit during an inspection in September 2019, he added. The last inspection of the A unit was on April 23, 2021, and seven smoke detectors and three carbon monoxide monitors were in the apartment and another two were installed, Mr. Indala said. He said the property has been owned by the Philadelphia Housing Authority since the 1960s. According to the agency, more than 80,000 people in Philadelphia live in its homes. Mr. Murphy, the Fire Department official, said there had also been an inspection in 2020. Mr. Indala said that the housing authority inspected its properties annually, and that a priority in those inspections was checking smoke detectors and carbon monoxide monitors. If people living in one of the housing authority’s homes have issues with these devices, he said, they should contact the agency immediately and will receive a response within 24 hours. Philadelphia’s leaders mourned the deaths of four adults and eight children in a rowhouse fire on Wednesday, struggling to put their grief into words in the aftermath of the blaze. Mayor Jim Kenney called the fire “tragic” at a news conference outside the burned-out rowhouse, in the city’s Fairmount neighborhood. “I don’t have much more to say than please keep all these folks, and especially these children, in your prayers,” he said. Mr. Kenney, whose father was a firefighter, later recalled how fires that killed children left his own family grieving in their aftermath. His father, he said, “would basically lock himself in his bedroom for a couple of days and my mother would say, basically, ‘Don’t go near the door.’” Fire Department leaders were similarly emotional as they described what firefighters found once they were able to enter the building. “It was terrible,” said Craig Murphy, first deputy fire commissioner. “I’ve been around for 35 years now and this is probably one of the worst fires I have ever been to.” He added, shaking his head: “I don’t have the words for how we’re feeling right now as a community and as a Fire Department.” Darrell L. Clarke, the president of the City Council, said the city would try to learn from the fire and what led to the tragedy. “This just punched you in the gut,” he said. City Council members called for accountability, though the cause of the fire was not immediately clear. “We must learn from what occurred here to prevent it from happening again,” one member, Jamie Gauthier, wrote on Twitter. “This is an immensely dark day for Philadelphia,” another council member, Kendra Brook, said. “We must get to the root cause of this horrific tragedy so that it never happens again.”"

Once again, as they face the highly contagious Omicron variant, medical personnel are exhausted and are contracting the virus themselves. And the numbers of patients entering hospitals with the variant are surging to staggering levels, filling up badly needed beds, delaying nonemergency procedures and increasing the risk that vulnerable uninfected patients will catch the virus. But in Omicron hot spots from New York to Florida to Texas, a smaller proportion of those patients are landing in intensive care units or requiring mechanical ventilation, doctors said. And many — roughly 50 to 65 percent of admissions in some New York hospitals — show up at the hospital for other ailments and then test positive for the virus. “We are seeing an increase in the number of hospitalizations,” said Dr. Rahul Sharma, emergency physician in chief for NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital. But the severity of the disease looks different from previous waves, he said. “We’re not sending as many patients to the I.C.U., we’re not intubating as many patients, and actually, most of our patients that are coming to the emergency department that do test positive are actually being discharged.” Though it’s still early for firm predictions, the shift in hospital patterns fits with emerging data that Omicron may be a variant with inherently milder effects than those that have come before, less prone to infecting the lungs, where it can cause serious disease. But the lower proportion of severe cases is also happening because, compared with previous variants, Omicron is infecting more people who have some prior immunity, whether through prior infection or vaccination. The vast majority of Omicron patients in I.C.U.s are unvaccinated or have severely compromised immune systems, doctors said. Hospitals, facing staff shortages, are under enormous strain. In New York City, hospitalizations have exceeded the peak of last winter’s surge. And Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, noting that the state had more hospitalized Covid-19 patients at that time than at any previous point during the pandemic. “We’re in truly crushed mode,” said Dr. Gabe Kelen, director of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s emergency department. The number of I.C.U. patients is a lagging indicator, likely to rise in the coming weeks, experts said. What’s more, some states are still struggling under the crush of hospitalizations from Delta, a previous version of the virus that may be more virulent. (Hospitals are frequently in the dark about which variant newly admitted patients are infected with.) Still, several reports suggest that Omicron is a foe different from the variants that came before. And the challenges hospitals face — at least so far — are less about stockpiling equipment and more about staffing and contagion, doctors said. “Early on in the pandemic, we were worried about running out of things, like ventilators,” said Dr. Ryan Maves, an infectious disease and critical care physician at the Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C. “Now, the real limitations are obviously physical bed space, but even more so, it’s staffing.” When reports emerged in early December that hospitals in South Africa were handling relatively few severe Omicron cases, experts stressed that the findings should be interpreted with caution. South Africa has a relatively young population, and a large proportion had been infected by previous waves, leaving the affected people with some pre-existing immunity. But now that the virus has spread across the world and the United States, there is more evidence that many people who have been infected with Omicron in recent weeks seem to be faring better than those who were infected with other variants or during earlier surges. In Britain, people with Omicron were about half as likely to require hospital care and one-third as likely to be admitted to the hospital from emergency rooms as those infected with Delta, according to a government report released last week. Early reports from Canada suggest a similar pattern. And a new report from the Houston Methodist health care system, which has been sequencing the vast majority of viral samples from its patients since February 2020, found broadly the same thing. By Dec. 20, the new variant was causing more than 90 percent of new Covid cases at Houston Methodist. In the new analysis, researchers compared 1,313 symptomatic patients who had been infected with Omicron by that date to Houston Methodist patients who had been infected with the Delta or Alpha variants beginning earlier in the pandemic. The numbers of Omicron cases examined in Houston are small, and it takes time for the worst outcomes to manifest. But fewer than 15 percent of those early Omicron patients were hospitalized, compared with 43 percent of the Delta patients and 55 percent of the Alpha patients, the study found. Among those who were admitted, Omicron patients were also less likely to require mechanical ventilation and had shorter hospital stays than did those infected with the other variants. “On average — and I’m stressing on average — the Omicron cases are less severe,” said Dr. James Musser, the chair of pathology and genomic medicine at Houston Methodist, who led the research. He added, “And that’s obviously good news for our patients.” The Omicron patients were also younger, and more likely to be vaccinated, than were those with previous variants, which may partially account for the milder illness. Although the reports are encouraging, it is still too early, and there is not yet enough detailed data, to draw firm conclusions about Omicron’s inherent severity, said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at Emory University in Atlanta. “There hasn’t been really quite enough time,” Dr. Dean said. It took months for numerous large studies of Delta’s hospitalization risks to appear. In New York City, cases have been steadily rising since December and are now overwhelmingly accounted for by Omicron. Covid hospitalizations have also increased sharply, and I.C.U. admissions have been rising more slowly. At New York University’s Langone Health, for example, around 65 percent of patients admitted with Covid were “incidentally” found to have the virus, and their hospitalizations were not primarily because of the illness. At NewYork-Presbyterian, just under half of Covid admissions were incidental. Hospitals in other cities have also been reporting higher rates of incidental infections. Across Jackson Health System hospitals in Florida, 53 percent of the 471 patients with Covid were admitted to the hospital primarily for other reasons. At Johns Hopkins Medicine in Maryland, 20 percent of patients seeking treatment for non-Covid complaints are testing positive for infections, said Dr. Kelen of Johns Hopkins. Incidental infections can still pose significant risks for people who are hospitalized for other health problems. And the high number of hospitalized patients with asymptomatic Covid presents an additional challenge for infection control. “You still need to put them in isolation,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease specialist at the Emory University School of Medicine. “You still need to treat them as patients who could potentially transmit Covid in the hospital. And when you have less staff, then you really have a problem.” At NYU Langone, intensive care admissions are 58 percent lower among people hospitalized for Covid than they were in January 2021, said a spokeswoman, Lisa Greiner. At Mount Sinai South Nassau, doctors are also seeing fewer patients requiring critical care compared with previous peaks, but the sheer number of cases means that there are higher numbers of people getting very sick than in recent months. “I would say on the whole, the illness is less severe,” said Dr. Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious diseases and epidemiologist at the hospital. But, he added, “We have had deaths from Covid, which we haven’t seen in a long time. And we’re seeing patients in the I.C.U. and on ventilators, which we haven’t had in a long time.” The majority of people who are going into I.C.U.s are unvaccinated or are vaccinated people who are in higher risk groups, experts said. And among people who make it into I.C.U.s, cases can still be as severe as with prior variants. The increase in hospitalizations has put further stress on overburdened hospitals. Many hospitals were already struggling with staffing shortages before Omicron emerged. Even when hospital beds are available, an exodus of health care professionals over the course of the pandemic has made it more difficult to deliver care. “There’s just no capacity,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and the academic dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health. “There’s not adequate staff for the beds that exist.” The rise in hospitalized Covid cases has happened alongside a rise in hospitalizations for other conditions, said Dr. Sharma of NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell, putting further strain on hospitals. At the peak of the pandemic in 2020, those admissions plummeted as people without Covid avoided hospitals. “People aren’t scared to come to the hospitals like they were in 2020. Our volumes in our E.R.s are almost back to, if not above, prepandemic numbers,” Dr. Sharma said. “That means that we’re busy — capacity becomes an increased challenge.” The staff shortages are leading many hospitals to consider reducing elective surgeries. “We’re never going to crowd out strokes, and we’re never going to crowd out heart attacks,” said Ed Jimenez, chief executive of the University of Florida Health Shands hospital system. “But if this keeps going the way it’s going, we’re going to have hospitals that have to start considering slowing down their planned admissions.” At Grady Hospital in Atlanta, “we’re hoping not to cancel elective surgeries, but we’ve considered it,” Dr. del Rio said. “The reality is that we’re finding that some of these elective surgeries are canceling themselves because people are coming in and testing positive for Covid.” It has been about six weeks since the world first learned about Omicron, and hospital personnel are still waiting nervously to see how the coming weeks unfold. As of Tuesday morning, Houston Methodist had 630 inpatients with the virus across its eight hospitals, Dr. Musser said, the vast majority of whom most likely have Omicron. That figure remains below the system’s Delta peak — in which there were between 850 and 900 inpatients with the virus at once — but the numbers of new cases are still rising, he said. “How high will it go?” he said. “Can’t tell you. Don’t know. We’re all watching it, obviously, very, very closely.”"

The case is the latest example of Americans misusing the Paycheck Protection Program, a part of the $2.2 billion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act that Congress passed in March 2020. In the latest case, the Georgia woman, Hunter VanPelt, pleaded guilty to bank fraud in August after submitting six loan applications for a total of more than $7.9 million on behalf of companies that she owned or controlled, prosecutors said.  Prosecutors say that Ms. VanPelt, 49, whose legal name was Ellen Corkrum until 2016, lied about payroll expenses and the number of people her companies employed. She also submitted fraudulent tax records, payroll reports and bank statements, they said. Her lawyer could not be immediately contacted for comment overnight. The Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had recovered about $2.1 million of the $6 million that Ms. VanPelt received through the program. It said a bank had also seized and returned an additional $1.6 million. The giant loan program, which ran intermittently from April 2020 to May 2021, relied on banks and other lenders. To speed the lending process, the federal government waived much of the vetting that lenders traditionally do on business loans. The program has been highly susceptible to fraud. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin estimated in August that about $76 billion of its $800 billion in loans might have been taken improperly. (They also made a more conservative estimate of $38 billion.) The Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had prosecuted more than 150 defendants so far and seized more than $75 million in cash derived from fraudulent loans through the program, along with properties and luxury items. Last month, a former New York Jets wide receiver, Joshua J. Bellamy, was sentenced to 37 months in prison after he fraudulently obtained more than $1.2 million through the Paycheck Protection Program for a company that he owned. Prosecutors said that Mr. Bellamy had spent more than $100,000 of the funds on luxury goods from Dior, Gucci and other brands. He pleaded guilty in June to conspiracy to commit wire fraud."

Djokovic, the world’s No. 1 male tennis player and a prominent vaccination skeptic, announced on social media on Tuesday that he was “heading Down Under with an exemption permission.” The tournament’s organizers confirmed that he had been granted a medical exemption after a review process by two independent panels, a procedure that suggested he remained unvaccinated. Reaction among the pro tennis elite was somewhat measured. After Alex de Minaur and James Duckworth, who are both from Australia, absorbed the news, Duckworth said at a news briefing at the ATP Cup in Sydney, “If he’s fit the criteria, then, yeah, he should be able to come.” “That’s very politically correct of you,” de Minaur replied with a laugh. He added, “I just think it’s just very interesting; that’s all I’m going to say.” Other Australians used social media to express their anger at the decision. The hashtag #DjokovicOut trended on Twitter on Wednesday. Commentators pointed out that spectators at the Australian Open must be vaccinated. Stephen Parnis, a former vice president of the Australian Medical Association, tweeted: “I don’t care how good a tennis player he is. If he’s refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn’t be allowed in. If this exemption is true, it sends an appalling message to millions seeking to reduce #COVID19Aus risk to themselves & others. #Vaccination shows respect, Novak.” Another Twitter user called it “a slap in the face of millions of Australians.” Jamie Murray of Britain said on Tuesday after his ATP Cup doubles match: “I think if it was me that wasn’t vaccinated, I wouldn’t be getting an exemption. But well done to him for getting clear to come to Australia and compete.” Djokovic has long held nontraditional views of science and medicine — he once asserted that prayer and belief could purify toxic water — and he has had a complicated relationship with the pandemic. He has also said that vaccination is a private and personal decision that should not be mandated. When the Australian Open announced that vaccines would be required to gain entry into the country, Djokovic’s father referred to the mandate as “blackmail.” Jacinta Allan, acting premier of Victoria state, where the Australian Open will be held, called on Djokovic to explain his reasons for attending the tournament. “It’s the government’s expectation that when he does arrive, he explains to the Victorian community what’s the circumstances, and can then explain some of these motives behind his actions and his intentions in playing here in Australia,” she said on Wednesday at a news conference. Craig Tiley, the chief of Tennis Australia, which hosts the tournament, acknowledged that some people “will be upset about the fact that Novak has come in because of his statements of the past couple of years around vaccination,” but he said that Djokovic had not been given any special favors. The answered to whether the tennis player could even enter the country for the tournament came with a resounding “no” on Thursday. After a 10-hour standoff with government officials at a Melbourne airport, where he was held in a room overnight, Djokovic was told he had to leave the country. The issue appeared to turn on questions about the evidence supporting a medical exemption from a coronavirus vaccine. The federal government says that if international travelers cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, they “will need to provide proof” to airline staff. Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia echoed that at a news conference on Wednesday, saying that if Djokovic arrived in Australia, he would have to provide “acceptable proof that he cannot be vaccinated.” “If that evidence is insufficient,” Morrison said, “he won’t be treated different to anyone else and he’ll be on the next plane home.”"

They’re not entirely encouraging, and I will get into some detail about one of the biggest problems — the stress on hospitals, which are facing huge numbers of moderately ill Covid-19 patients. But regular readers of this newsletter know that I try to avoid the bad-news bias that often infects journalism. (We journalists tend to be comfortable delivering bad news straight up but uncomfortable reporting good news without extensive caveats.) So I want to be clear: The latest evidence about Covid is largely positive. A few weeks ago, many experts and journalists were warning that the initial evidence from South Africa — suggesting that Omicron was milder than other variants — might turn out to be a mirage. It has turned out to be real. “In hospitals around the country, doctors are taking notice,” my colleagues Emily Anthes and Azeen Ghorayshi write. “This wave of Covid seems different from the last one.” There are at least three main ways that Omicron looks substantially milder than other versions of the virus: Somebody infected with Omicron is less likely to need hospital treatment than somebody infected with an earlier version of Covid. An analysis of patients in Houston, for example, found that Omicron patients were only about one-third as likely to need hospitalization as Delta patients. In Britain, people with Omicron were about half as likely to require hospital care, the government reported. The pattern looks similar in Canada, Emily and Azeen note. Hospitalizations are nonetheless rising in the U.S., because Omicron is so contagious that it has led to an explosion of cases. Many hospitals are running short of beds and staff, partly because of Covid-related absences. In Maryland, more people are hospitalized with Covid than ever. “Thankfully the Covid patients aren’t as sick. But there’s so many of them,” Craig Spencer, an emergency room doctor in New York, tweeted on Monday, after a long shift. “The next few weeks will be really, really tough for us.” The biggest potential problem is that overwhelmed hospitals will not be able to provide patients — whether they have Covid or other conditions — with straightforward but needed care. Some may die as a result. That possibility explains why many epidemiologists still urge people to take measures to reduce Covid’s spread during the Omicron surge. It’s likely to last at least a couple more weeks in the U.S. Omicron is not just less likely to send somebody to the hospital. Even among people who need hospital care, symptoms are milder on average than among people who were hospitalized in previous waves. A crucial reason appears to be that Omicron does not attack the lungs as earlier versions of Covid did. Omicron instead tends to be focused in the nose and throat, causing fewer patients to have breathing problems or need a ventilator. As Dr. Rahul Sharma of NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell told The Times, “We’re not sending as many patients to the I.C.U., we’re not intubating as many patients, and actually, most of our patients that are coming to the emergency department that do test positive are actually being discharged.” In London, the number of patients on ventilators has remained roughly constant in recent weeks, even as the number of cases has soared, John Burn-Murdoch of The Financial Times noted. In the U.S., mortality trends typically trail case trends by about three weeks — which means the Omicron surge, which began more than a month ago, should be visible in the death counts. It isn’t yet: Covid deaths will still probably rise in the U.S. in coming days or weeks, many experts say. For one thing, data can be delayed around major holidays. For another, millions of adults remain unvaccinated and vulnerable. But the increase in deaths is unlikely to be anywhere near as large as the increase last summer, during the Delta wave. Look at the data from South Africa, where the Omicron wave is already receding: Given the combination of surging cases and milder disease, how should people respond? Dr. Leana Wen, Baltimore’s former health commissioner, wrote a helpful Washington Post article in which she urged a middle path between reinstituting lockdowns and allowing Omicron to spread unchecked. “It’s unreasonable to ask vaccinated people to refrain from pre-pandemic activities,” Wen said. “After all, the individual risk to them is low, and there is a steep price to keeping students out of school, shuttering restaurants and retail shops and stopping travel and commerce.” But she urged people to get booster shots, recommended that they wear KN95 or N95 masks and encouraged governments and businesses to mandate vaccination. All of those measures can reduce the spread of Covid and, by extension, hospital crowding and death. What about elderly or immunocompromised people, who have been at some risk of major Covid illness even if they’re vaccinated? Different people will make different decisions, and that’s OK. Severely immunocompromised people — like those who have received organ transplants or are actively receiving cancer treatment — have reason to be extra cautious. For otherwise healthy older people, on the other hand, the latest data may be encouraging enough to affect their behavior. Consider this: Before Omicron, a typical vaccinated 75-year-old who contracted Covid had a roughly similar risk of death — around 1 in 200 — as a typical 75-year-old who contracted the flu. (Here are the details behind that calculation, which is based on an academic study.) Omicron has changed the calculation. Because it is milder than earlier versions of the virus, Covid now appears to present less threat to most vaccinated elderly people than the annual flu does. The flu, of course, does present risk for the elderly. And the sheer size of the Omicron surge may argue for caution over the next few weeks. But the combination of vaccines and Omicron’s apparent mildness means that, for an individual, Covid increasingly resembles the kind of health risk that people accept every day.

The Dixie Fire burned more than 963,000 acres in the Northern California areas of Butte, Plumas, Lassen, Shasta and Tehama Counties in July, destroying 1,329 buildings and damaging 95 others. The cause, investigators determined, was a tree that came into contact with PG&E’s power lines near the Cresta Dam about 100 miles north of Sacramento. Investigators at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, referred their findings to the Butte County district attorney, who previously brought charges against PG&E for the 2018 Camp Fire, which killed scores of people and destroyed the town of Paradise. In that case, PG&E pleaded guilty to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter and one felony count of illegally setting a fire. The utility also agreed to pay $3.5 million in fines as part of the criminal plea. In a statement in response to Cal Fire’s determination, PG&E said the tree that fell struck equipment that was functioning properly. “This tree was one of more than eight million trees within strike distance to PG&E lines,” the utility said. “Regardless of today’s finding, we will continue to be tenacious in our efforts to stop fire ignitions from our equipment and to ensure that everyone and everything is always safe.” PG&E also has charges pending in Shasta County, where the district attorney has charged the utility with manslaughter, along with other felonies and misdemeanors in connection with the Zogg Fire, which burned more than 56,000 acres and destroyed 204 buildings near Redding. Since 2017, PG&E has been the focus of the state’s extreme wildfires that have been made worse by climate change. The company has taken numerous steps to prevent wildfires, including installing weather stations and cameras. The utility has also resorted to the extreme measure of cutting off power, sometimes to millions of people for days. After PG&E amassed $30 billion in liability from the wildfires caused by its equipment, the utility sought bankruptcy protection in January 2019. The company exited bankruptcy in July 2020, promising to work to prevent further wildfires. Victims of the fires have continued to seek compensation for their losses that became part of the company’s bankruptcy plan. The Dixie Fire — among at least three fires that PG&E’s equipment was suspected of causing last year — underscored the lingering threat of wildfires caused by utility equipment."

But death found them anyway. On Dec. 9, her goofy, football-loving 11-year-old son, Elyjah, and some friends were walking to a gas station for after-school snacks when one of Elyjah’s best friends, a 12-year-old, pulled a gun from a backpack and shot Elyjah in the head. It was the second time last year that the family had been jolted by gun violence. Two weeks before Elyjah was killed, his 5-year-old cousin, Khalis Eberhart, was fatally shot after a 3-year-old cousin found a gun under a sofa cushion. “It’s easy to get a gun. It’s easy for our kids to get one,” said Elyjah’s mother, Ms. Munson, who believes that her son’s death was not intentional. “When you’re a kid frivolously playing with something you think is a toy, this is what happens.” The number of children and teenagers killed by gunfire has risen sharply during the coronavirus pandemic. Researchers describe the increase as a fatal consequence of rising nationwide homicide rates, untreated traumas of Covid-19 and a surge of pandemic gun-buying that is putting more children into close contact with guns — both as victims and those wielding guns. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the rate of gun deaths of children 14 and younger rose by roughly 50 percent from the end of 2019 to the end of 2020. And it appears the toll grew worse last year. More than 1,500 children and teenagers younger than 18 were killed in homicides and accidental shootings last year, compared with about 1,380 in 2020, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a publicly sourced database that tracks gun deaths in real time ahead of official government counts. Toddlers are discovering guns under piles of clothes and between couch cushions. Teenagers are obtaining untraceable ghost guns made from online kits. Middle school students are carrying handguns for protection. While children die of gunfire at far lower rates than adults, the rise in young lives cut short has raised alarms with police officials and families across the country. “We keep seeing the same thing over and over again,” said Keith Meadows, the police chief in South Fulton, Ga, where two young children, including Khalis Eberhart, have recently died of accidental shootings. “When the pandemic hit, we just had this big influx of people getting gun permits. People are buying these weapons without getting the right type of education.” Police departments and cities across the country are struggling to intervene. Larger cities like Philadelphia tormented by rising youth violence are plowing millions into violence-intervention programs, youth leadership groups and community groups. In December, Chief Meadows held a gun safety course that 50 parents attended, some with their children in tow. A day later, a 3-year-old boy was wounded after he found a gun under a bed and shot himself in the stomach. Much of the toll is concentrated in a few dozen big cities, with Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston and Milwaukee at the top of the list, according to the Gun Violence Archive. But few American places go unscathed. In Sedalia, a city of 22,000 in central Missouri, 4-year-old Andre Walker fatally shot himself at home after finding the loaded family handgun. D’Shaunti Kyanni Hunter, 17, was found shot to death in a rural Georgia cemetery. After a gunman killed four teenagers at Oxford High School in Michigan, the local prosecutor filed involuntary manslaughter charges against the parents of the 15-year-old suspect. The prosecutor accused the teenager’s parents of buying him the handgun as a Christmas present and leaving it available to him in an unlocked bedroom drawer, even as school officials raised alarms about their son’s violent fantasies. The parents have pleaded not guilty. But for the most part, adult gun owners are not charged when their weapons are involved in shootings that kill children and teenagers, legal experts say. And some families said they were frustrated that the shootings — which disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic children and teenagers in poorer neighborhoods — did not seem to stir much wider concern. “It’s like a normal thing,” said Kim Sipes, whose 16-year-old nephew, Ramon Sosa, was shot and killed with his grandmother over the summer in Oklahoma City. A 16-year-old has been charged in their deaths, reflecting how the number of youths 19 and younger who commit homicides rose by nearly 20 percent between 2019 and 2020, according to F.B.I. crime data. Ms. Sipes said she wanted Oklahoma legislators to pass laws that would prevent 16-year-olds from gaining access to handguns, but said she had little hope that her nephew and sister’s killings would galvanize them to act. Even a fund-raising website her family set up to cover funeral costs struggled to reach a third of the $10,000 goal. Researchers say public health agencies and schools strained by two years of the pandemic are now falling behind in addressing the roots of the current surge in violence affecting children. “We hoped that as life resumed things would go back to the way they were,” said Sarah Burd-Sharps, senior director of research at Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group funded largely by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor. “It’s clearly not happening.” Instead, anti-violence activists say a sense of helplessness and anger has taken root. “Is it Covid? Is it mental disorders? Are these guns getting into the hands of younger kids?” asked Malissa Thomas-St. Clair, an activist in Columbus, Ohio, who co-founded the group Mothers of Murdered Columbus Children after a 14-year-old boy shot and killed his 2-year-old nephew last year. “There’s nowhere you can hide.” A recent tally from Mike McLively, who directs the Community Violence Initiative at the gun control group Giffords, found that 15 states have pledged nearly $700 million toward gun-violence prevention. The pandemic interrupted many of these programs, and cities are now scrambling to catch up. “It is absolutely a crisis,” said Erica Atwood, senior director of Philadelphia’s Office of Policy and Strategic Initiatives for Criminal Justice and Public Safety. More than 30 children and teenagers died in shootings in the Philadelphia area last year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. In Columbus, Ohio’s booming capital, activists say a rise of chaotic, sometimes inexplicable eruptions of gun violence aimed at children has left neighborhoods reeling and children too frightened to walk home from bus stops. In 2019, three children 17 and younger were killed by gunfire. That number rose to 20 in 2020 and 17 last year, according to police statistics. Bereaved families have begun organizing to demand action from the police and community leaders. Mothers march in matching orange T-shirts and wave posters of their slain children. They visited impromptu vigils at murder scenes until one was shot up over the summer. In Columbus, 2021 began with the murder of two young children. Late on New Year’s Day of last year, Ava Williams, 9, and her sister, Alyse, 6, were shot and killed by their father, who had spent the pandemic in and out of work and hoarding guns. “I was worried about Covid,” said Vanecia Kirkland, the girls’ mother, who described her daughters as loving and inseparable sisters. “I should have been worried about their father.” Then in early December came the grim news that another pair of children had been killed. Demetrius Wall’Neal, a football-loving 9-year-old, and his 6-year-old sister, Londynn, who never left home without a favorite sparkly purse, were climbing into a car with their mother’s boyfriend when gunmen walked up and sprayed the car with bullets, killing all three. “How could you kill two babies?” their grandmother Jessica Jones wondered as she sat inside a bakery one morning in the Columbus suburb where Demetrius had played football. “I just don’t understand. When does it end?”"
77,The New York Times,nytimes,"Breaking News: A severe fire killed at least 13 people, including seven children, at a rowhouse in Philadelphia, officials said.",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F333AYKq%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0N9UdpDwGZXhcFs3LeN-P3y8k3X81WZiVilAHIV9pviKCm_OvYnpNYEyg&h=AT3rlmHLcw7IfDhkJ_BOaWD3lA0wZOdqh_jqBFnQjWM8USia4ot6-g5hrlEop9rxxOC9Yq-j3S2-ZSuugLRAV_b5dVnzzKrO7zMzfdF9eVsen_Q2wh8EPUaM8vkJVLIFkIYFcjm-2GGrFDUL8uGi&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT2heffXOjhXnOkwrK1cjCSceO-UDm8Wqvgn-5nMY0CR72QMzTfecHpKWCVmQRoSa3hb1z0A5UiLN7x7jzrll35ZqhFZdPiDHBZr3bSPofGkIoYdT9r6oHNspSopPrZhDdTvemNbnTaPEide4ebnljR4G4mUltf9qDKdWpErWFOWUNKY,1d,"Follow our live updates on the Jan. 6 Capitol Attack Anniversary. By almost any measure, the criminal investigation of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol is a prosecutorial effort of unparalleled complexity and scope. For an entire year, federal agents in almost every state have been poring over mounting stacks of tipster reports, interviews with witnesses, public social media posts and private messages obtained by warrants. They have also collected nearly 14,000 hours of video — from media outlets, surveillance cameras and police-worn body cameras — enough raw footage that it would take a year and a half of around-the-clock viewing to get through it. While the Justice Department has called the inquiry one of the largest in its history, traditional law enforcement officials have not been acting alone. Working with information from online sleuths who style themselves as “Sedition Hunters,” the authorities have made more than 700 arrests — with little sign of slowing down. The government estimates that as many as 2,500 people who took part in the events of Jan. 6 could be charged with federal crimes. That includes more than 1,000 incidents that prosecutors believe could be assaults. As of this week, more than 225 people have been accused of attacking or interfering with the police that day. About 275 have been charged with what the government describes as the chief political crime on Jan. 6: obstructing Congress’s duty to certify the 2020 presidential vote count. A little over 300 people have been charged with petty crimes alone, mostly trespassing and disorderly conduct. But a big question hangs over the prosecutions: Will the Justice Department move beyond charging the rioters themselves? So far, the department has provided no public indication of the degree to which it might be pursuing a case against former President Donald J. Trump and the circle of his allies who helped inspire the chaos with their baseless claims of election fraud. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland is scheduled to give a speech on Wednesday, one day before the anniversary of the attack on the Capitol, but is not expected to provide any signals about the direction of the department’s investigation. A spokeswoman said he would not address any specific cases or individuals. On Capitol Hill, the House select committee on Jan. 6 is interviewing witnesses and has issued subpoenas to a number of high-profile figures allied with Mr. Trump. And with Mr. Garland and the Justice Department remaining mum about their intentions, members of the committee have signaled a willingness to exert pressure on the department, saying they would consider making criminal referrals if their investigation turns up evidence that could support a prosecution against Mr. Trump or others. Even the prosecutions of those who rioted at the Capitol have presented an array of moral and legal challenges that have bedeviled judges, prosecutors and defense lawyers. Overworked courts have tried to balance the laborious exchange of discovery materials with speedy trial protections and to manage the bleak conditions at Washington’s local jails where some defendants are being held without bail. They have also faced a fundamental, underlying tension: how to mete out justice on an individual level to hundreds of defendants who together helped form a violent mob. With rare speed for a large-scale prosecution, more than 160 people — or slightly more than 20 percent of all who have been charged — have pleaded guilty at this point. Of those, not quite half have already been sentenced. A few weeks ago, Robert Palmer, a Florida man who hurled a fire extinguisher at police officers, was sentenced to more than five years in prison, the longest term handed down so far. In November, one of the most familiar figures in the attack — Jacob Chansley, the so-called QAnon Shaman, who breached the Senate floor in a horned helmet with a fur draped over his shoulders — was sentenced to 41 months, a term he is appealing. Beneath the headlines, however, there has been a steady stream of penalties for lower-profile defendants: bricklayers, grandmothers, college students, artists, church leaders and long-haul truckers who, by and large, have admitted to little more than illegally entering the Capitol. Many, if not most, have avoided incarceration, sentenced to probation or stints of home confinement. Others have received only modest sentences, ranging from a few weeks to a few months. In court, those accused of minor crimes have almost always expressed remorse, saying their behavior was foolish, embarrassing or out of character. Some have broken into tears or, in one case, physically collapsed. Others have vowed never to attend a political rally again. Federal judges have taken slightly different positions on how to punish the defendants. Judge Trevor N. McFadden, appointed by Mr. Trump, often prefaces his sentences by calling the events that day “a national embarrassment” — though he has frequently declined to jail petty offenders. Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, an Obama appointee, has often given sentences higher than those requested by the government. Her go-to phrase: “There must be consequences.” Judge Amit P. Mehta told John Lolos, a defendant clearly steeped in election fraud conspiracies, that not only had he been lied to, but those who had done the lying were not “paying the consequences.” “Those who orchestrated Jan. 6 have in no meaningful sense been held accountable,” said Judge Mehta, another Obama appointee. “In a sense, Mr. Lolos, I think you are a pawn.” From the start, prosecutors faced a unique legal problem: Never before had members of Congress been forced from the House and Senate floors while finalizing the transition of presidential power. What law should be used to charge this crime? The government settled on an unusual obstruction law — the obstruction of an official proceeding before Congress. It brought the charge against scores of people believed to have disrupted the democratic process, often alongside more traditional counts of trespassing, vandalism and assault. The obstruction law, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, had a few advantages. First, it allowed the authorities to avoid deploying more politically fraught — and harder-to-prove — counts like sedition or insurrection. It also permitted prosecutors to home in on the specific behavior of defendants and judge how much their actions contributed to the chaos that day. If someone went deep into the Capitol, say, or took some other action that helped to chase officials from their duties, chances are they have been charged with an obstruction count. But many defense lawyers have claimed the law was wrongly used. Passed in 2002 as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which sought to clamp down on corporate malfeasance, the measure was initially intended to prohibit things like shredding documents or tampering with witnesses in congressional inquiries. Defense lawyers have argued that prosecutors have stretched the law beyond its scope and used it to criminalize behavior that too closely resembles ordinary protest protected by the First Amendment. In the past few weeks, however, five federal judges have ruled that the law is valid, and it now seems certain it will be permitted in scores of Jan. 6 prosecutions, including some that will soon go to trial. The earliest Capitol riot trials are scheduled to begin next month. When the proceedings start, jurors will most likely get a glimpse of how the government believes members of the mob worked together. The first trial, set to begin on Feb. 24, will focus on Robert Gieswein of Colorado, a self-proclaimed militiaman charged with assaulting officers with a chemical spray. In court papers, the government has indicated that it intends to show the jury videos of Mr. Gieswein’s assaults and to offer evidence that he told a reporter he was at the Capitol on Jan. 6 “to execute these fascists.” The papers also suggest that prosecutors believe Mr. Gieswein may try to argue he was acting in self-defense when he fought with the police — a strategy that several other defendants have embraced. A second trial, scheduled to start on Feb. 28, will feature another accused militiaman, Guy Reffitt, a former oil industry employee who the government has said is a member of the Texas Three Percenters radical gun rights movement. At Mr. Reffitt’s trial, prosecutors plan to tell the jury that he brought an AR-15 rifle and a semiautomatic handgun to Washington, and was wearing a special holster designed for concealed weapons. The government has also said it will call a Secret Service agent who will testify that he and other agents protecting Vice President Mike Pence that day were adversely affected by the chaos and violence. At least so far, prosecutors appear to be building their cases from the bottom up, starting with those they can accuse of definable crimes and looking for potential links to others. That said, one possible avenue for moving up the food chain is the case of Owen Shroyer, the right-hand man of the far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Mr. Shroyer marched on the Capitol with Mr. Jones and Ali Alexander, the Stop the Steal organizer, on Jan. 6 and was arrested months later on disorderly conduct charges. Neither Mr. Jones nor Mr. Alexander has been charged. But both men had connections to the Trump White House. Mr. Jones helped organize the rally at the Ellipse near the White House before the riot and has said that White House officials told him that he was to lead a march to the Capitol, where Mr. Trump would speak, according to the House committee investigating Jan. 6, which issued a subpoena to him in November. It remains unclear how two other investigations into lawyers who have worked with Mr. Trump — Sidney Powell and Rudolph W. Giuliani — might also intersect with the inquiry into the riot. While neither of those investigations, which appear to be focused on financial improprieties and federal lobbying laws, are directly connected to the Capitol attack, both Ms. Powell and Mr. Giuliani helped Mr. Trump spread lies about the election before Jan. 6. Perhaps the best source for potential charges against prominent political defendants is the House select committee. While the panel’s stated goal was to put together an authoritative record of the attack and recommend ways to ensure it never happened again, investigators have started to consider making criminal referrals to the Justice Department. Even as prosecutors have demonstrated with vivid evidence the pro-Trump nature of the mob and the extent of the violence, Mr. Trump and his allies have continued seeking to rewrite the history of the Capitol attack through a nearly yearlong disinformation campaign. “The real insurrection happened on Nov. 3, the Presidential Election, not on Jan. 6 — which was a day of protesting the Fake Election results,” Mr. Trump declared in November. At different moments, conservative commentators and politicians have dismissed those who took part in the assault on the Capitol as mere tourists and have lionized them as martyrs and political prisoners. They have alternately blamed undercover F.B.I. agents and leftists in disguise for the storming of the building. One group of people has seen through these baseless claims: a subset of the defendants who have been prosecuted for attacking the Capitol. Several have stood up in court and admitted they felt betrayed by Mr. Trump and were deluded by his efforts to portray the election as rigged. At his sentencing hearing, for example, Mr. Palmer said that he had recently recognized that the former president and those around him were “spitting out the false narrative about a stolen election and how it was ‘our duty’ to stand up to tyranny.” Eventually, he said, he came to understand that “they were the tyrannical ones, desperate to hold on to power at any cost.”"

The current chairman of the alliance, the Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, said in a statement that the troops would be stationed there only “for a limited time period,” until order could be restored. He did not elaborate on how many soldiers could be mobilized or how long they might stay. Russia is notorious for sending in troops under the guise of peacekeeping missions that go on to establish a permanent presence in the host countries. The Kazakh president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, issued the invitation earlier in the evening. Calling the demonstrators “a band of international terrorists,” he said he was turning to Russia’s version of NATO, called the Collective Security Treaty Organization, to “help Kazakhstan overcome this terrorist threat.” The revolt began on Sunday in western Kazakhstan as a protest against a surge in fuel prices. Four days later, with government buildings, TV stations, the airport and numerous businesses stormed by thousands of anti-government protesters, the uprising has expanded into a full-throated attack on an entrenched Kazakh elite widely reviled as autocratic and corrupt. On Thursday, a police spokeswoman said dozens of people had been killed by the authorities when they tried to storm government buildings, police headquarters and district police offices, the first widespread fatalities involving protesters since the demonstrations started. That announcement came after earlier reports in the local news media that the police had opened fire on demonstrators in the oil city of Atyrau, killing at least one person. Footage posted online on Wednesday showed thousands of people storming the main government building in the country’s largest city, Almaty. Smoke billowed from the building that afternoon as the crowd began to disperse. The regional branch of the governing Nur Otan party was also set on fire, local news outlets reported, as was the former presidential residence. News services reported renewed clashes between protesters and the police, who used stun grenades and tear gas to quell the crowd. Protesters also set fire to the prosecutor’s office in Almaty before heading for the president’s residence. The Almaty police said that protesters burned 120 cars, including 33 police vehicles, and damaged about 400 businesses, and that more than 200 had been detained. The country’s Internal Affairs Ministry said that eight members of law enforcement had died in the clashes.   The protests began peacefully Sunday in the oil town of Zhanaozen, after the government doubled the cost of liquefied petroleum gas — used to fuel vehicles in Kazakhstan — to about 100 tenge, or 22 cents, per liter. By the time the government announced on Tuesday that it would rescind the price increase, the protests had spread across the country, with broader demands for increased political representation and improved social benefits. Apparently unsatisfied by an announcement early Wednesday that the entire government would be sacked and that new parliamentary elections were possible, protesters took control of the country’s main airport. The protests reverberated across the continent to Moscow, where President Vladimir V. Putin was forced to witness another uprising against an authoritarian, Kremlin-aligned nation, following pro-democracy protests in Ukraine in 2014 and in Belarus in 2020. The protests represent a warning signal for the Kremlin, said Arkady Dubnov, a Central Asia expert in Moscow, describing the government in Kazakhstan as “a reduced replica of the Russian one.” He added: “There is no doubt that the Kremlin would not want to see an example of such a regime beginning to talk to the opposition and conceding to their demands.” The timing is particularly awkward for Mr. Putin, who hopes to use three meetings next week with Western delegations to renegotiate post-Cold War international security agreements on Ukraine and what Russia considers its sphere of influence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The revolt also seemed to mark a decisive break with the rule of Kazakhstan’s former president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who stepped down as president in 2019 but had still kept a hand in the country’s affairs. Video footage showed protesters toppling a statue of Mr. Nazarbayev in the capital of the Almaty region, Taldykorgan, with people chanted “shal ket,” Kazakh for “Old man, leave!” He has played no role in combating the protests, leaving that to his hand-picked successor, Mr. Tokayev. While initially conciliatory, the government has taken a steadily harder line against the protesters, imposing a strict state of emergency throughout the country. Mr. Tokayev said Wednesday that he would assume all formal levers of power and promised to “act with maximum toughness.” Kazakhtelecom, the country’s largest telecommunications company, shut off internet access throughout the country on Wednesday afternoon. Kazakhstan, with a population of 19 million, is by far the richest country in Central Asia, with a GDP per capita of $27,000 and more than $35 billion in reserves, yet it was still possible for the country to devolve into chaos in a matter of days. The instability is a potential source of concern among foreign oil companies, particularly in the United States. ExxonMobil and Chevron have invested tens of billions of dollars in western Kazakhstan, the region where the unrest began this month. A Chevron-led consortium is in the midst of a project to expand output at the on-land Tengiz oil field at an estimated cost of $37 billion, one of the single largest energy investments in the world today. Many Kazakhs were incensed by the increase in the gas price because their country is not just the recipient of tens of billions in energy investments but also an exporter of oil and gas. The price rise added to the economic misery in a country where the coronavirus pandemic has helped underscore severe income inequality. Mukhtar Umbetov, a rights activist who took part in protests in Aktau, said that while the turmoil may have been sparked by economic grievances and the pandemic, the root cause was the absence of democratic processes. The Kazakh government, he said, “has removed all legal ways to participate in politics.” Speaking by phone from Aktau, on the Caspian Sea, he said that “people don’t have any political intermediaries who would solve problems that exist in the country.” Nevertheless, he said, in a country where the average salary is $570 a month — and where many earn considerably less than that — economic resentments are not to be discounted. “Kazakhstan is rich, but its natural resources are not working in the interests of all; they work in the interests of a small group of people.” As the protests have unfolded, the demands of the demonstrators have expanded to include broader political liberalization. Among the changes they seek is the direct election of Kazakhstan’s regional leaders, rather than the current system of presidential appointment. Much of the ire has been directed at the country’s autocratic former ruler, Mr. Nazarbayev, who led the country for 30 years after independence in 1991. Mr. Tokayev became president after elections derided by Western observers as flawed. After that, Mr. Nazarbayev was formally recognized as the “leader of the nation,” and the country’s capital was renamed Nur-Sultan in his honor. Until now, he had been widely regarded as the shadow leader of Kazakhstan despite the formal transition of power to Mr. Tokayev. But that appears set to change. On Tuesday, Mr. Tokayev dismissed Samat Abish, Mr. Nazarbayev’s nephew, from the position of first deputy head of the country’s national security service, a successor to the K.G.B. And on Wednesday, Mr. Tokayev replaced Mr. Nazarbayev as head of the country’s Security Council. Speaking about the unrest, Mr. Tokayev asserted that the protests were “highly organized” as part of a “meticulously thought-out plan of conspirators, who were motivated financially.” He said that people had been “killed and wounded” and that “crowds of bandit elements beat and mocked servicemen, took them naked through the streets, abused women and robbed shops.” The countries of the former Soviet Union are watching the protests closely. For Russia, the events represent another possible challenge to autocratic power in a neighboring country. Russia intervened militarily in Ukraine in 2014 after pro-democracy protests erupted there, and the Kremlin offered support to the Belarusian dictator Aleksandr G. Lukashenko as he violently crushed peaceful protests against his autocratic rule in 2020. The Kremlin currently has “peacekeeping” forces stationed in Transnistria and the contested territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, as well as supporting Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. It also occupies parts of Georgia and Abkhazia."

The chief, J. Thomas Manger, who took over the force in July, told the Senate Rules Committee that the Capitol Police were already addressing 90 of the 103 recommendations made by the agency’s inspector general. They include streamlining intelligence operations and purchasing badly needed new equipment. “We fully understand the need to restore confidence in our ability to fulfill our mission each day, no matter the circumstances,” Chief Manger said in written testimony to the committee, which last month heard critiques of the agency from the inspector general, Michael A. Bolton. “The men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police proved their mettle on Jan. 6. I take full responsibility for restoring confidence in the leadership of the department. We have accomplished a great deal, with more work to be done.” Mr. Bolton told the committee that only about 30 of his recommendations had been implemented. Chief Manger said another 60 were in progress, and that he had assigned an inspector to ensure that all of them are ultimately put in place. The Capitol Police remain under tremendous strain a year after being overrun by a mob of Trump supporters who stormed the building as Congress met to count electoral votes to formalize Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory in the presidential election. About 150 officers from the Capitol Police, Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department and other local agencies were injured in the violence, including more than 80 from the Capitol Police alone. Afterward, numerous failures by the agency were made clear, even as lingering grief, trauma and fear suffused its ranks. The failures included findings that managers had not equipped the force with enough riot gear or produced an adequate plan for a potential riot, and had ignored or overlooked intelligence reports warning of attacks on lawmakers. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, spoke at the Rules Committee hearing and praised the changes to the force. The top three officials in charge of security at the Capitol a year ago have all been replaced, and Congress has approved more than $70 million for upgrades to the police force. “Today the Capitol is a whole lot safer than it was a year ago,” Mr. Schumer said. Even so, Mr. Schumer said that the “root cause” of the mob attack was still a threat to the country, as former President Donald J. Trump continues to make false claims that the election was stolen from him through widespread fraud. “What has this country come to?” Mr. Schumer asked. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota and the chairwoman of the Rules Committee, said it was important for rank-and-file officers to hear that the agency was undertaking reforms. “It’s important for the officers who were protecting us on the front line — cuts on their faces, losing their friends and colleagues to suicide — to hear about the progress that’s been made,” Ms. Klobuchar said in an interview, adding, “In some cases, the insurrectionists had better gear than they did.” Ms. Klobuchar noted that Capitol Police officers’ jobs had become only tougher since the Jan. 6 attack because the agency was responding to a greater number of threats against lawmakers. Chief Manger said the agency encountered more than 9,000 threats last year, a large increase from the 902 threat investigations recorded in 2016, requiring a heightened workload. At the same time, he said, the agency is down more than 400 officers from full operating strength. Chief Manger said the force had made key new hires and planned to ramp up recruitment efforts, including setting a goal of hiring 280 new officers each year for the next three years, as well as quickly bringing in other security workers under contract to free up sworn officers. He also outlined other improvements, including making enhancements to the way the department gathers and shares intelligence and beefing up the Civil Disturbance Unit. “We’ve gotten new shields,” Chief Manger said. “We’ve ordered all new equipment for our Civil Disturbance officers.” He added that the force had prepared a 25-page security plan for Thursday’s anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack. A Department of Homeland Security intelligence analysis from Dec. 30, which was obtained by The New York Times, concluded that “threat actors will try to exploit the upcoming anniversary of the 6 January 2021 breach of the U.S. Capitol to promote or possibly commit violence, but we currently lack reporting on a specific or credible threat.” The report said the “mostly likely threat of violence surrounding the 6 January anniversary stems from lone offenders seeking to target perceived ideological opponents, political symbols or law enforcement.” Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, the top Republican on the Rules Committee, highlighted legislation Congress passed last year to make it possible for the Capitol Police chief to unilaterally request the assistance of the National Guard. He said that and similar reforms were needed to better protect the police officers who were overrun during the Capitol attack. “These officers were the true heroes of Jan. 6,” Mr. Blunt said. Chief Manger’s testimony came a day after three police officers injured in the attack filed two separate federal lawsuits seeking to hold Mr. Trump accountable for the violence. One suit was filed by Officer Marcus Moore, a 10-year veteran of the Capitol Police who is invoking the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 to seek to hold Mr. Trump responsible for his “central role in inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection and the resulting attack on the law enforcement officers defending the peaceful transition of power.” In his suit, Officer Moore recalled rioters pinning him against a wall, punching him repeatedly, spraying bear spray in his face, calling him racial slurs and threatening to take his weapon and kill him with it. “We are not going to die like this!” he recalled saying. The other was filed by two Washington police officers, Bobby Tabron and DeDivine K. Carter, who were attacked relentlessly outside the Capitol and in a tunnel on the West Front of the building that officers now refer to as the Tunnel of Death. They were struck with fists, flagpoles and projectiles and sprayed with chemicals, according to their suit. Officers Tabron and Carter were uncertain whether they would make it home alive, according to the suit, as they battled to defend the Capitol. Their suit also cites the Ku Klux Klan Act and asserts that Mr. Trump — who told supporters to “fight much harder” and “show strength” at a rally on Jan. 6 while urging them to head to the Capitol — violated laws against inciting a riot, disorderly conduct, civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting assault and battery. The suits bring to at least six the number filed against Mr. Trump by people who were at the Capitol during the attack. Lawyers for the former president have argued that Mr. Trump should not be held liable for the actions of the mob, citing both his right to free speech and a claim of presidential immunity. “To attempt to hold a political leader vicariously liable for the actions of others as a result of constitutionally protected political speech would contradict the Supreme Court’s well-established First Amendment precedent,” Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Jesse R. Binnall, wrote in response to one suit. “Even if the speech in question was not cloaked with the highest presumption of legal protection, plaintiffs’ claims are precluded by absolute presidential immunity.” Oral arguments are scheduled for Jan. 10 in suits filed against Mr. Trump by Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California; Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi; and Officers James Blassingame and Sidney Hemby of the Capitol Police."

The question of why these people were at the Capitol that day is hard to answer, but the some of the most useful clues come from three F.B.I. interviews that have been released to the public.

In the aftermath of the storm, safety experts have offered advice on how people can stay safe if they are stuck in their vehicles. Their top tip? Be prepared. But first, a caveat: Check the weather forecast before hitting the road, they said. If a snowstorm is expected, it is best to stay put. For those who venture out anyway, here are some important safety tips should disaster strike. Some important essentials to bring are food, water and a charged cellphone, said Dr. Ken Zafren, an emergency medicine professor at Stanford University and an emergency physician at the Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage, Alaska. Beyond that, experts said it would be helpful to have the following: parkas, blankets, sleeping bags, boots, mittens, hats, flares, medications, wipes, a shovel, a first-aid kit, a cellphone charger, an ice scraper, jumper cables and a full tank of gas. Even better: Keep these items in your car year-round, experts said. You are on the road. Snow is blanketing the ground. Traffic is gridlocked. What now? First, do not leave your car, experts said. It is the safest place to be until the storm dies down. “No matter how cold it is inside the car, it will be colder outside,” said Gordon Giesbrecht, a professor at the University of Manitoba who has studied human responses to extreme environments. Resist the temptation to head out and find help, he added. If you go outside, you could get hypothermia or become lost. Instead, generate heat by turning on the car for up to 10 minutes every hour, said Dr. Steve Mitchell, a medical director at the Harborview Medical Center’s emergency department in Seattle. Any longer could waste gas. Human bodies naturally generate warmth, although younger people lose heat faster, he added. Wear a hat so you do not lose heat from your head. Dr. Giesbrecht suggests maximizing your body heat by hugging your chest and putting your hands in your armpits. There is only one situation in which you should step outside: if you need to check that your tail pipe is clear, to eliminate the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning from exhaust, experts said. It is easy to feel isolated or scared, but remember that you are surrounded by other people who are also stranded, said Dr. Grant Lipman, the founder of the Global Outdoor Emergency Support, an app that offers tips for emergencies. If you have them, eat foods that are high in fat and carbohydrates, which will give you energy and help generate warmth, he added. That includes nuts, chocolate and candy bars. If you run out of water, drink melted snow, Dr. Mitchell said. But don’t drink alcohol. It will disorient you. Have wipes and a bottle handy if you need to go to the bathroom, Dr. Lipman said. While your phone may provide a needed distraction, it is important to preserve your battery so that you can make emergency calls, he said. Close your browser and any other battery-draining apps. Instead, you can distract yourself by doing small exercises in the car, which will also help you stay warm, Dr. Lipman said. Lean breeds, older dogs, and puppies are more susceptible to hypothermia, according to the American Kennel Club. Experts said you should include items for your pets in your emergency kit, such as a blanket and food. While in the car, you could huddle with your pet for warmth. Ideally, you can cover the pet with some form of insulation. When your engine is running, turn on your hazard lights or dome lights so rescuers can see you, experts said. The National Weather Service suggests tying a bright-colored cloth to your antenna or door. When the snow lets up, raise the hood to signal for help. Drive slowly to avoid skidding, and note that it takes longer to decelerate in icy road conditions, according to AAA. Accelerating too rapidly can cause wheels to spin out of control. Maintain distance from other cars, trucks, and snow plows. Tire pressure drops in cold weather. Drivers should inspect tires monthly and before long trips, according to guidance issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration."

Union members had criticized the district’s response to the Omicron variant, which has pushed cases in the city to record levels, and said conditions in classrooms were unsafe. They voted on Tuesday to refuse to report to school buildings, just two days after returning from winter break. But Mayor Lori Lightfoot said reverting to online schooling was unacceptable and unnecessary, and her administration decided to call off class altogether — keeping the buildings open for emergency child care — rather than return to virtual instruction. “Nobody signs up for being a home-schooler at the last minute,” Ms. Lightfoot said. “We can’t forget about how disruptive that remote process is to individual parents who have to work, who can’t afford the luxury of staying home.” Ms. Lightfoot, a Democrat, urged teachers to report to work and suggested they were considering an illegal work stoppage. The Chicago Teachers Union said late Tuesday night that 73 percent of members who voted favored pausing in-person instruction. As highly contagious Omicron rears its head, so do debates that were considered settled. After a relatively calm fall, when administrators, unions and families largely agreed that remote schooling was a nonstarter, the brinkmanship between the nation’s third-largest district and its union exposes just how quickly that political consensus can fall away. Like other school systems, Chicago has had to confront a shortage of tests, and a far from universal vaccination rate among students. There have been large numbers of staff members calling in sick, and widespread anxiety among just about everyone. Other districts, including in Cleveland, Milwaukee and Atlanta, have also gone online temporarily, but without a public labor dispute. “We are between a rock and a hard place — the rock being the pandemic, the hard place being an intractable, incompetent mayor,” Stacy Davis Gates, the union’s vice president, said this week. She added, “We said a two-week pause so they could get themselves together, have the proper communication, put in the necessary mitigations.” Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Chicago to their highest rate since the pandemic began. But as in the rest of the country, vaccinated adults have had lower rates of hospitalization and death, while children of all ages — regardless of vaccination status — have overwhelmingly been spared severe outcomes. In addition, data from Chicago and elsewhere shows that in-school transmission of Covid-19 has been limited, with the majority of teacher and student cases originating outside school buildings. More than 90 percent of Chicago Public Schools employees are fully vaccinated. Still, members of the powerful Chicago Teachers Union have accused the school district of failing to adjust to Omicron, and the growing threat of breakthrough infections. During the holiday break, they had asked for either universal P.C.R. testing of students and staff or a two-week transition to remote learning. Pedro Martinez, the district’s chief executive, said on Tuesday that he would be more aggressive about shutting down school buildings if large numbers of staff and students there had coronavirus infections. But he pushed back against a districtwide shutdown, suggesting that misinformation was at the root of anxiety over reopening. He spoke of the district’s $100 million investment in improving building ventilation, and efforts to monitor air quality in each classroom. He said he had continued “to plead, including with C.T.U. leadership, to keep the schools open, to keep the classes going.” Dr. Allison Arwady, the city’s public health commissioner, said on Tuesday that she remained “extremely comfortable” with students learning inside schools. “We’ve got to do risk-benefit analysis here, and at least among children, we have to think of this as similar to flu,” Dr. Arwady said, explaining that Chicago is averaging seven child hospitalizations per day because of Covid-19. But the district’s bungled effort to test tens of thousands of students over winter break only added to parents’ and teachers’ concerns. Most of the roughly 150,000 mail-in P.C.R. tests given to students were never returned. Of the 40,000 or so tests that were mailed in, a majority produced invalid results. Mr. Martinez said that many families had trouble following the test instructions, and that he had learned an important lesson: that student testing should be conducted at schools in order to be effective. “I wanted to reduce the anxiety level, and I’m just disappointed that I couldn’t achieve that,” said Mr. Martinez, who called on the federal government to address the persistent shortages of tests. Moving forward, the district has committed to providing at least 30,000 screening tests per week; there are about 340,000 students in the system. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised schools to avoid quarantines and closures by using a protocol known as test-to-stay, in which close contacts of positive virus cases take two rapid antigen tests in a week; only those who test positive must stay home. But officials in Chicago, like those in many cities and towns across the country, said they did not have nearly the number of rapid tests they needed. Dr. Arwady, the health commissioner, said the city had not received new shipments of the rapid tests since November, despite outstanding orders. She attributed the rapid test shortage to the federal government’s efforts to centralize the purchasing and distribution of the tests, and said she expected the problem to abate soon. “If you’ve got the means, I would go ahead and order home tests right now,” she advised families — a further burden on parents awaiting news on whether their children would be attending school the following day. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said her union’s Chicago affiliate was not to blame for the labor strife. She asked why the nation’s two larger districts, New York City and Los Angeles, had been able to collaborate with unions to set up testing programs, while Chicago’s testing effort had failed. Pandemic school closures have contributed to backlash against union-affiliated Democrats in places like Virginia and New Jersey, particularly in majority-white suburbs. But Ms. Weingarten said she was not worried about the political ramifications in Chicago. The city is heavily Democratic, and its public school students are predominantly Black and Latino. “I’m worried about it for the kids and for the teachers and for families,” she said. Some parents in Chicago have questioned the wisdom of reopening classrooms amid Omicron, and Mr. Martinez acknowledged that there were schools where most children had not been in class this week. Nicole Perkins, a mother of three who lives on Chicago’s South Side, said it had been scary to send her children back to school. Two of her children tested positive for the coronavirus shortly before winter break, and she said she did not trust the district’s safety precautions. The union vote, she said, was an act of courage. Ms. Perkins, who pays her sister to look after her children when classes are taught remotely, said there were benefits when children remained in the classroom. “But should those benefits,” she said, “come at costing them their lives possibly or the long-term side effects of Covid?” Shelley Davis, whose oldest daughter is a high school senior, said that while she thought teachers’ perspectives were important — her mother is a member of the Chicago union — she hoped the district could find some compromise to keep children in school. Ms. Davis, who runs a foundation, is also concerned about what students may be losing socially if they go back to remote learning. “It kind of breaks my heart,” she said. “They’re having such a different childhood than what I can imagine.” Maria Hadden, who represents a diverse North Side ward on the Chicago City Council, said she worried about the long-term impact of the repeated labor strife, and said she hoped that Mr. Martinez, who is new in his role, would take a different approach than his predecessors. Relations between the union and City Hall have been extraordinarily tense for a decade, stretching across the tenures of Ms. Lightfoot and her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel. In 2019, months before the pandemic, teachers went on strike for 11 days and extracted concessions from Ms. Lightfoot on pay, class sizes and support staff. A year ago, when schools first returned to in-person instruction, the city and union engaged in weeks of tense negotiations. “Having these very public head-butting sessions is really detrimental for, I think, Chicago Public Schools overall,” Ms. Hadden said. She added, “People expect us to get over ourselves, to get over our really strong need to be absolutely right or to not be seen as giving into demands.”"

Not seemingly among his competitors. Many of them figured as soon as the tournament announced late last year that players could apply for a medical exemption from the Covid-19 inoculation requirement that officials would find a way for Djokovic, the vaccine-averse, 20-time Grand Slam tournament champion, to compete for a record 10th title in Australia. And when that exemption came through on Tuesday, and Djokovic, a Serb ranked No. 1, posted a picture of himself on Twitter announcing his imminent departure for Australia, reaction among the pro tennis elite ranged from skeptical to inspired. There was this exchange from Alex de Minaur and James Duckworth, both of Australia, after they lost their singles matches in the ATP Cup, a team tournament in Sydney. “If he’s fit the criteria, then, yeah, he should be able to come,” Duckworth said. “That’s very politically correct of you,” de Minaur said with a laugh. “As James has very wisely put out there, I think he’s said all the right things there. Look, I just think it’s just very interesting, that’s all I’m going to say.” By Wednesday, Australian politicians were weighing in. The minister for home affairs, Karen Andrews, released a statement that suggested the government could revoke Djokovic’s exemption, and the country’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, said health officials expected to see evidence that Djokovic merited his exemption, and threatened to put the tennis star “on the next plane home” if he did not meet the strict requirements for one. “We await his presentation and what evidence he provides us to support that,” Morrison said. “If that evidence is insufficient, then he won’t be treated any different to anyone else and he’ll be on the next plane home. There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic at all.” Djokovic, who is tied with Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer for the most Grand Slam men’s singles titles, has long held some nontraditional views of science and medicine (he once asserted that prayer and belief could purify toxic water) and has had a complicated relationship with the pandemic. In June 2020, when sports were still largely shut down, and long before experts deemed it safe for people to gather and for large events to take place, Djokovic organized a series of exhibition matches in Serbia and Croatia and invited several of the world’s top players to participate. They obliged, and several of them became infected with the coronavirus, including Djokovic. Eventually, vaccines became available and a debate ensued about requiring tennis players to get inoculated, to protect themselves, tennis fans and tournament organizers, since the tours are an 11-month journey around the world. Djokovic was adamantly against this. He has long said vaccination is a private and personal decision that should not be mandated. This placed him at odds with his chief rivals, Federer and Nadal, who are vaccinated. Just last month, Nadal said he did not have a position on a mandate but deferred to the experts who said vaccines were the best way to protect everyone. “I don’t pretend to know more than what the authorized people say,” Nadal said last month during his preparation for the Australian Open in the United Arab Emirates. He tested positive for the coronavirus upon his return to Spain. “If the people who really know about it say that we need to be vaccinated, who I am to create a different opinion?” Throughout last year, the WTA, the professional women’s tour, and the ATP, the men’s circuit, did not require a vaccination, though players often have had to adhere to staying within a strict bubblelike environment as they hopscotched the world. But then the Australian Open announced a vaccine would be required to gain entry into the country. Djokovic’s father referred to the mandate as “blackmail.” A confrontation between tournament organizers and Novak Djokovic appeared inevitable, producing mixed emotions at the top of the game. Djokovic’s absence would make it easier for his rivals to win. But while he is not exactly close with Federer or Nadal, he is extremely popular among many top players, including leading members of the so-called next generation like Alexander Zverev of Germany, Daniil Medvedev of Russia and Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece, who also happen to be his neighbors in Monte Carlo. “Hopefully the Australian government will make an exemption or whatever it is that they can do for him to be able to participate there,” Zverev said in November at the ATP Finals in Italy. Such an exemption had the potential to become a political hornet’s nest in Australia. The country has waged one of the most successful battles against Covid-19, but it has come at a steep price. Strict lockdowns have lasted for months. International borders were largely closed until recently. Inbound travelers had to adhere to an expensive, two-week quarantine upon arrival. For long periods, even domestic travel between states was also prohibited. The country has experienced only 2,200 deaths, but since opening its borders late last year it is now dealing with more than 30,000 cases a day. As the Australian Open approached, though, Craig Tiley, the tournament director, announced that in accordance with the government of Victoria, the state that contains Melbourne, there would be an independent review process to consider possible medical exemptions for unvaccinated players who had a “genuine reason.” Players had to pass muster with two panels of medical experts. The process included the redaction of personal information to ensure privacy, but that emphasis on privacy also meant that the panel and the tournament did not release any justification for exempting Djokovic. In a statement Tuesday, Tiley said: “Fair and independent protocols were established for assessing medical exemption applications that will enable us to ensure Australian Open 2022 is safe and enjoyable for everyone. Central to this process was that the decisions were made by independent medical experts and that every applicant was given due consideration.” Not everyone in the game believed that. “I think if it was me that wasn’t vaccinated I wouldn’t be getting an exemption,” Jamie Murray of Britain said on Tuesday after his ATP Cup doubles match. “But well done to him for getting clear to come to Australia and compete.” In a week and a half, Djokovic will do just that."

After finishing graduate school in 2019, he joined an e-commerce company in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing, got married and adopted a cat named Mango. In November of 2021, he moved to Shanghai to join one of China’s biggest video platforms, iQiyi. He was on track to achieve a much-desired middle-class life, documenting his rise on his social media account. Then barely a month into his new job, he was let go when iQiyi laid off more than 20 percent of its staff. The ranks of the unemployed technology workers are swelling, as China’s once vibrant internet industry is hit by a harsh and capricious regulatory crackdown. Under the direction of China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, the government’s unbridled hand is meddling in big ways and small, leaving companies second-guessing their strategies and praying to not become the next targets for crackdown. In place of the pride and ambition that dominated a few years ago, fear and gloom now rule as many tech companies lower their growth targets and lay off young, well-educated workers. Like their American counterparts, China’s biggest tech companies are regulated to limit abuses of power and to mitigate systemic risks. But Beijing’s hyper-political approach shows that it’s more about the Communist Party’s taking control of the industry than about leveling the playing field. The crackdown is killing the innovation, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit that made China a tech power in the past decade. It is destroying companies, profits and jobs that used to attract China’s best and brightest. Even people within the system are alarmed by the heavy-handed approach. The former head of China’s sovereign wealth fund urged restrictions on the power of regulators. Hu Xijin, the newly retired editor of the official newspaper Global Times and an infamous propagandist, said he hoped that regulatory actions should help make most companies healthier instead of leaving them “dying on the operating table.” The damage has been done. Some internet companies have been forced to shut down, while others are suffering from huge losses or disappointing earnings. Many publicly listed companies have seen their share prices fall by half, if not more. In the third quarter of last year, China’s biggest internet company, Tencent, posted its slowest revenue growth since its public listing in 2004. The e-commerce giant Alibaba’s profitability declined 38 percent from a year earlier. Didi, once the most valuable start-up in the country, reported an operating loss of $6.3 billion for the first nine months of 2021. In July, the authorities stopped Didi from signing up new users and ordered app stores to remove its services pending a cybersecurity investigation. The online-education and tutoring sector has nearly been eliminated after Beijing decided that the businesses created unnecessary burdens for parents and children, hindering a push to bolster the country’s low birthrates. Hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions, have lost their jobs. Online social media and entertainment platforms are pulling popular content and influencers, wary of repeated government warnings that their products and stars aren’t ideologically appropriate for the young. The video platform that laid off Mr. Zhao, iQiyi, had an abysmal quarter, losing about $268 million. Its share prices fell 85 percent from their high in 2021, reflecting investors’ concerns that the company, once aspiring to be China’s Netflix, will be short of shows that can attract more subscribers and advertisers. “The biggest problem for our industry is severe shortage of content supply,” iQiyi’s chief executive, Gong Yu, told analysts in November. He blamed, in part, censors’ slow approval. IQiyi did not respond to requests for comment. (Mr. Zhao confirmed the details in his social media account, but declined to comment further.) Many film, TV and streaming projects have been canceled or killed over concerns of increasingly harsh and unpredictable censorship, said people in the industry. Lilian Li, a writer in Beijing, said Tencent and a studio working with iQiyi approached her last year about creating a streaming series based on one of her history novels. A few weeks later, both companies told her that they had decided not to proceed because there was little hope of getting the censors’ approval for a history series. She said she received far fewer collaboration requests from content providers in 2021. Chinese content creators always joke that they dance with shackles on, meaning they try to satisfy the censors while appealing to their audiences. By now it’s clear that no matter the creative concessions, there’s no guarantee that their projects can see the light of the day. One of the most anticipated movies for the 2021 Christmas season had to change its name to “Fire on the Plain,” from “Moses on the Plain,” possibly because of its Christianity reference. Then four days before its release, the production team said it was postponed without giving an explanation. “Restrict this, cancel that. Regulate this, censor that,” Chen Jian, a stock market investor, wrote on the social media platform Weibo. This country “will become a cultural desert eventually.” Beijing wants its cyberspace to become a tool of governance and national rejuvenation. And it will penalize anyone who fails to serve the goal. In mid-December, the country’s internet regulator said it had ordered platforms to shut down more than 20,000 accounts of top influencers in 2021, including people who spoke ill of the country’s martyrs, entertainers involved in scandals and major livestreaming stars. Alibaba was slapped with a record $2.8 billion antitrust fine in September. That was followed by a $530 million fine of Meituan, the food-delivery giant, a month later. Weibo, China’s Twitter-like platform, was fined 44 times between January and November. Douban, the popular film- and book-reviewing site, was fined 20 times. In December, Huang Wei, a top influencer known as Viya, who sells about everything under the sun on Alibaba’s Taobao platform — from Kim Kardashian’s fragrance (hawking 6,000 bottles in the first 30 seconds) to a rocket launch service (for $5.6 million) — was fined $210 million for tax evasion. She lost more than 100 million followers after all her social media accounts were shut down. To prove their loyalty, many tech firms are positioning themselves to help build key technologies that will help the country break free from what Mr. Xi described as “stranglehold” weaknesses that the United States can exploit. That includes semiconductors, new energy and other advanced technologies. A Beijing-based venture capitalist said his firm had given up on investing in consumer tech completely and had been busy persuading scientists and semiconductor engineers to start businesses. It hasn’t been easy because not many scientists have the entrepreneurial drive, said the venture capitalist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the political environment. Li Chengdong, an e-commerce consultant who invests in start-ups, said some consumer internet companies he owned were struggling with higher compliance costs. “To stay on the safe side, they have to be stricter in compliance than what the government requires,” he said. The crackdowns are having a chilling effect on the job market. Many young Chinese are looking to the public sector for more stable positions, even though they pay less. There will be 10 million college graduates in China in 2022, according to the Education Ministry. About 4.5 million have applied to graduate schools, up 800,000 from 2021. More than two million people have applied to take civil servant examinations, up half a million, according to the Chinese state media. Olivia Fu worked as a project manager at the search engine giant Baidu in Beijing for five years before leaving last fall to join a big state-owned bank. She wrote on the social media platform Red that she had gone through a midlife crisis after turning 30. “When I got home after dark and saw my daughter asleep,” she wrote, “I asked myself if it was the job I wanted.” Now she works 9 to 5 at the bank and has more time with her family. But nobody chats in the office, and no personal items are allowed in cubicles. The pay is lower. Under her post titled “Escaping the internet layoff wave,” many comments praised her “prescience.” “I feel so lucky that I left the industry,” she said in an interview."
85,The New York Times,nytimes,"The news that Novak Djokovic, a prominent vaccination skeptic, received a medical exemption to play in the Australian Open, a procedure that suggested he remained unvaccinated against Covid, prompted outrage from some in Australia.",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3EYDUW9%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1pc0epUKRdKR6ooGhZgfXFM4__RsdLWZ5Ga-m6fia4_LtsvkwPvOw35Gc&h=AT2tG7mQl8tUNAvazvrBrSY5_tuBog9R7VwPIuXznLlDQGunfApnz-AlZ5zMMT3sKpl0z2xAZO5hfNb82hY0NzemSv1GH-jg1UNXlj7p8TQd1v1KLwjhsKkpU-jnB40Kl58iKdyrBH8WHU-Phzpd&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT17CEOJ-hTNc3OvyPIOqXPF-zfpqUJa3aA0F_36bYD_anfsbyWkLb8uo374eM8FpPAbRulSg7QDF5YtIaqJo1eCGEr1cgpbRPhms-oEYxRQlBDzksUZUbZRs6KN-8qhctWPDnW2qGVTPSvUb1rpJZPgYjVRqphQfd53hnHtp4BK0nth,1d,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday endorsed booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for children ages 12 to 17, citing rising infections in teens and young adults and a troubling increase in pediatric hospitalizations. As the contagious Omicron variant spreads through the country, public health officials have seized on extra vaccine doses as a first line of defense. Pfizer-BioNTech boosters are now authorized for any American older than 12 who is five months past his or her second dose of the vaccine. An advisory committee recommended the changes following a meeting on Wednesday. They were endorsed by Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director, on Wednesday night. Adolescents ages 12 to 15 may begin to receive boosters immediately. Adolescents ages 16 and older were already permitted to receive booster shots, but on Wednesday the C.D.C. panel strengthened the recommendation. The advisory panel followed a similar move earlier this week by the Food and Drug Administration, which authorized Pfizer-BioNtech boosters for adolescents and shortened the recommended time interval between the initial vaccine regimen and the booster. The F.D.A. also endorsed “an additional primary dose” of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for moderately or severely immunocompromised children aged 5 to 11, to be given 28 days after their second shots.  Studies suggest that vaccine side effects are minimal in children, although there is lingering concern about a link to myocarditis, a rare inflammation of the heart muscle that occurs more frequently in young men, following vaccination. In Israel, which started administering boosters to adolescents aged 12 to 15 in June and rigorously tracks side effects, the health ministry identified two cases of myocarditis, among some 41,600 adolescents in this age group who received the booster. Both children were hospitalized briefly and have fully recovered, said Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, an Israeli health official who addressed the committee. The booster dramatically reduced infection rates among children aged 12 to 15, Dr. Alroy-Preis said. Although most infected youngsters generally did not experience severe Covid disease that required hospitalization, two children — one boy and one girl — have died, she said. But while much of the committee’s discussion focused on the risks of the vaccine and its side effects, Dr. Camille Kotton, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who specializes in transplant and immunocompromised patients, said the focus should be on the disease itself, which is having a devastating effect on vulnerable and immunocompromised patients. “This is an important thing to think about — the risk of myocarditis from the disease itself,” Dr. Kotton said. Though Omicron is generally perceived as causing less severe disease, she said, she now sees numerous patients on life support. Some have died. “It’s a horrible state of affairs,” she said. “The highly infectious nature of Omicron is such that patients who have been incredibly careful the last two years have been getting infected with awful outcomes.” Dr. Katherine Poehling, director of pediatric population health at Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., expressed similar sentiments. “There are children waiting in the emergency department 18 hours and longer to get into the hospital because we’re so full,” she said. “We have parents asking us can their children get a booster dose, like older children.” But several committee members said they were increasingly disturbed that only a minority of younger children are getting vaccinated at all, and said it is critical to increase the rates and adhere to other prevention strategies, like masking. “We can’t put all of the burden on the people who are willing to get vaccinated,” said Lynn Bahta, a committee member who is a registered nurse with the Minnesota Department of Health. “When we have only half our adolescents vaccinated, that adds more burden as well. I am so concerned that the burden of disease prevention is all falling on the vaccinated and them getting the boosters.” More than 70 percent of people 12 and older in the United States are fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C. Children younger than age 5 are still not eligible for vaccination. Americans aged 18 and older who received Moderna’s vaccine can get a booster of any available coronavirus vaccine six months after the second shot. Those who received Johnson & Johnson’s single-shot vaccine may get a booster dose of any available vaccine two months after their first shot. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are both strongly preferred over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the C.D.C. has said. Only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is authorized for children ages 5 to 11; boosters are not yet recommended for this group. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday said it was not changing its definition of “full vaccination” against the coronavirus. But the agency changed its emphasis on the appropriate regimen, tweaking how it referred to the shots. The agency said that three doses of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna’s vaccines should be considered “up-to-date” inoculations, and that Johnson & Johnson recipients should receive a second dose, preferably of Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech, to also be considered up to date. The move amounted to a recommendation from federal health officials that Americans should change how they talk about vaccination schedules. People 12 years and older are eligible for boosters. “Consistent with how public health has historically viewed or even talked about how we recommend vaccines, we are now recommending that individuals stay up to date with additional doses that they are eligible for,” Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, said at a White House news briefing on Wednesday. The C.D.C. did not change the definition of what qualifies as full vaccination — a subject of intense interest to corporations, schools, state health departments and professional sports leagues, which have themselves been reconsidering what it means to be fully vaccinated. “The technical definition of ‘fully vaccinated’ — two doses of an mRNA vaccine or one dose of the J & J vaccine — has not changed,” Kristen Nordlund, a C.D.C. spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Individuals are considered fully vaccinated once they have received their primary series.” She added that the agency recommend that people “stay ‘up to date’ by receiving any additional doses they are eligible for, according to C.D.C.’s recommendations, to ensure they have optimal protection.” Parents across Chicago raced to find child care on Wednesday morning after jarring news: Classes in the nation’s third-largest public school district were canceled. The teachers’ union and Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration had failed to agree on how to keep schools open during an Omicron-fueled virus surge. Across the country, the wildly contagious Omicron variant has infected millions and complicated the return to classrooms and workplaces. But nowhere has returning to school been more acrimonious and unpredictable than in Chicago, where, after two days back in classrooms following winter break, 73 percent of teachers voted to stop reporting to work. The city responded by calling off school altogether, refusing the teachers’ call for remote instruction. With no deal reached by Wednesday evening, district officials said classes would be canceled again on Thursday. The abrupt pause in the academic calendar, rooted in years of enmity between the Chicago Teachers Union and City Hall, jumbled plans for hundreds of thousands of students and posed another major test for Ms. Lightfoot, a Democrat whose tenure has been marked by labor strife, the pandemic and a surge in homicides. “If they are in class and Covid is rampaging, that’s a problem. If they are not there and out on the streets, that’s a problem,” said Tamar Manasseh, who leads an anti-violence group in the city, and who said she was looking into ways to help children with nowhere to go during the day. “This has put us in an untenable situation.” Ms. Lightfoot, whose disagreements with the Chicago Teachers Union date back to a strike in the early months of her term, said in an interview that the two sides remained far apart as negotiations continued. Ms. Lightfoot said she intended to take legal action against the union, and on Monday evening said the city had filed an unfair labor practices complaint. The school district opened buildings for meal distribution on Wednesday and published a list of places where parents could get emergency child care. “The consequences of the union acting like this time and time again are profound,” Ms. Lightfoot said. She added, “You think about the consequences for the families to be faced with the hostage choice of either going to work or taking care of their kids and home-schooling — no parent should be put in that position.” Australia blocked Novak Djokovic, the top-ranked men’s tennis player in the world, from entering the nation ahead of the Australian Open tournament, after immigration authorities said he didn’t meet entry requirements. “Mr. Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia, and his visa has been subsequently canceled,” the Australian Border Force said in a statement. “Noncitizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa canceled will be detained and removed from Australia.” His arrival in the country on Wednesday was mired in confusion after an airport dispute about the validity of his visa and questions about the evidence supporting an exemption from being vaccinated. Australia allows travelers who can show proof either of vaccination or of a valid medical reason for not being vaccinated to enter the country without quarantining. Djokovic, an outspoken critic of vaccine mandates, has not said publicly whether he has been vaccinated against the coronavirus. But he announced on Tuesday that he had received a medical exemption from the Australian Open’s vaccine mandate to defend his title in Melbourne, where the year’s first major tennis tournament is played. Tournament officials confirmed that in a statement on Tuesday, saying his application had been reviewed by two independent panels, a procedure that strongly suggested that he was unvaccinated. An Australian newspaper, The Age, reported that a plane carrying Djokovic landed at Tullamarine Airport in Melbourne around 11:30 p.m. local time on Wednesday, and that Djokovic, who is Serbian, was still being questioned by officials from the Australian Border Force more than six hours later. Kyrie Irving, the star Nets guard, made his regular-season debut against the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night following the team’s surprise reversal of its policy to bar him from practices and road games until he received the coronavirus vaccine. Irving looked rusty early on against the Pacers, missing his first three shots. But in the second quarter in Indianapolis, he began to heat up and scored 8 straight points. Irving declined to be vaccinated for Covid-19 before the season, making him ineligible to play in New York City because of a local vaccine mandate at sports arenas that went into effect in September. The Nets, citing concerns about team chemistry, announced in October that Irving would not be permitted to play in road games either, even if laws in those cities would allow him to participate. The N.B.A. does not require players to be vaccinated. For the most part, the team has played well in Irving’s absence, and has led the Eastern Conference for much of the season. Entering Wednesday, the Nets were No. 2 in the East, behind Chicago, with a 23-12 record after losing four of their last six games. But last month, as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus began ravaging N.B.A. rosters, the Nets announced they would let Irving play in road games. Sean Marks, the team’s general manager, said at the time that the Nets were “faced with a roster that has been decimated over the course of the last several days.” Several of the Nets’ top players, including Kevin Durant and James Harden, have missed games because of the league’s virus-related health and safety protocols. Irving was immediately placed into the protocols as well. The N.B.A.’s rules say an unvaccinated player can be placed into the protocols because of a positive or inconclusive test, or a confirmed exposure to a person who had tested positive. Players can be cleared to play again through testing and isolation periods that vary according to the players’ symptoms but that can be as short as a few days. When Irving returned to action on Wednesday night, all of the Nets’ roster was available except guard Joe Harris, who is out with an ankle injury. The United States Postal Service says it wants an exemption to the federal vaccine-or-test mandate because it could hinder its ability to deliver the mail. “The Postal Service is seeking temporary relief because it wants to ensure that its ability to deliver mail and packages is not hindered amid the current disruptions in the nation’s supply chain,” Darlene Casey, a U.S.P.S. spokeswoman, said in a statement on Wednesday. In November, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued an emergency order requiring that organizations with more than 100 employees require their workers to either be vaccinated against Covid-19 or be tested weekly and subjected to stricter face-covering requirements. The U.S.P.S. formally requested a variance from that order in a letter to OSHA dated Tuesday. “We are now in the middle of our peak season (mid-October through January), which is our busiest and most challenging time of year,” Deputy Postmaster General Doug A. Tulino wrote in the letter, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times. “The American people are relying on us to timely deliver their mail and packages throughout the holiday season — which aren’t limited to holiday packages but include critical items like Treasury checks, Covid-19 tests and pharmaceuticals.” He added that the mandate was “likely to result in the loss of many employees” just when they are needed most. Such a loss “would have a potentially catastrophic impact on our ability to provide service to the American public when demand is at its highest,” Mr. Tulino wrote. The Postal Service requires all employees and contractors “who interact with the public” to wear face coverings “when there is a state, local or tribal directive in place that requires face coverings to be worn,” Mr. Tulino wrote. Face coverings are also required for employees and contractors who cannot maintain social distancing, he wrote.  Those policies apply regardless of a person’s vaccination status, he said. In the last 18 months, the Postal Service has received “only a handful of citations” related to pandemic restrictions, which, Mr. Tulino wrote, “illustrates that the Postal Service’s established Covid-19 mitigation measures have been extremely successful to date.”   Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York said she would ask the State Legislature to make the sale of drinks to go at bars and restaurants legal, cementing in law a popular emergency policy that helped the battered hospitality industry weather the first year and a half of the pandemic. In her annual state of the state address, Governor Hochul said that legalizing to-go drinks was “something our bars and restaurants have been asking for” because it was “a critical revenue stream during the lean times last year.” Her aides said she would send a bill to the Legislature during the current session. She added, “Cheers, New York.” The previous governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, had used his emergency powers during the first year of the pandemic to put in place a special “off-premises privileges” rule allowing to-go alcohol sales. The measure was intended to throw a lifeline to the struggling food and beverage industry. Customers quickly grew accustomed to the convenience of takeout drinks. But the rule died when the state of emergency ended last June and the Legislature did not pass a measure that would extend it. Several other states, including Iowa and Arizona, have legalized the sale of takeout alcohol during the pandemic. Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, welcomed the news that Ms. Hochul would push for legislative action on the issue this year. “The drinks to go policy provides critically important revenue streams to struggling restaurants and bars and is extraordinarily popular with the public, unsurprisingly,” he said in a statement. Mr. Rigie added, “We commend Governor Hochul for her leadership, and we look forward to toasting her administration and the State Legislature once this important policy is reinstated.” The announcement on Wednesday came as the highly contagious Omicron variant has driven cases to record highs in New York State. New daily cases were averaging more than 66,000 by Jan. 4, according to a New York Times database. The Italian government made Covid-19 vaccination mandatory for people 50 and older on Wednesday, as it sought to curb the explosive growth in new cases because of the Omicron variant. The government also approved rules that prevent the unvaccinated from entering businesses, including banks, post offices and some stores. Previously, workers older than 50 could show proof of a negative test to do their jobs. Now they will have to be vaccinated or show proof they have recovered from an infection. The measures go into effect on Feb. 15. “We want to curb the growth of infections and push the Italians who haven’t gotten vaccinated yet to do so,” Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, said in a statement on Wednesday. “We are targeting in particular age groups that are at higher risk of being hospitalized to reduce the pressure on hospitals and save lives.” Mr. Draghi added that the government’s goal was to keep hospitals working while, at the same time, keeping schools and businesses open. With new infections rising fast, scientists fear that hospitals may soon have to shut down regular activities to devote beds and personnel to Covid patients. Almost 7 percent of Italians over 50 are estimated to have not received any vaccination yet. Vaccination rates are high in Italy, the first country outside China to be severely hit by the pandemic. But there still are millions of unvaccinated people. The government also set aside 92.5 million euros, or about $104.6 million, for free rapid testing in schools to lessen the effect of the virus and avoid the huge use of remote learning, said the education minister, Patrizio Bianchi. A small, new real-world study suggests that two widely used at-home antigen tests, the Abbott BinaxNOW and Quidel QuickVue, may fail to detect some Omicron infections even when people are carrying high levels of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, focused on 30 people infected with the virus at five workplaces that experienced what were most likely outbreaks of the Omicron variant in December. The people received both saliva-based P.C.R. tests and rapid antigen tests using nasal swabs. It took three days, on average, for people to test positive on a rapid antigen test after their first positive P.C.R. result. In four cases, people transmitted the virus to others while the rapid test showed the negative result, according to the study, which was conducted by several members of the Covid-19 Sports and Society Working Group. It is not clear whether the infections were missed because the antigen tests are inherently less sensitive to Omicron or because saliva tests may be better at detecting the new variant. But the results are consistent with other preliminary evidence that the at-home tests that many Americans have come to rely on — at least as currently administered, with a nasal swab — may fail to detect some Omicron cases in the first days of infection. The researchers said they shared their results with federal officials — including at the White House, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — in real-time, as the outbreaks were occurring last month. The study comes a week after the Food and Drug Administration released its own update on the effectiveness of the rapid antigen tests. “Early data suggests that antigen tests do detect the Omicron variant but may have reduced sensitivity,” the agency said. President Biden’s coronavirus response coordinator said Wednesday that, beginning next week, Americans struggling to get tested for the coronavirus will be able to have the cost of rapid at-home tests reimbursed by their insurers, but offered no specific promises about when free tests would be available. The remarks by Jeff Zients, who leads the White House pandemic response, come two weeks after Mr. Biden said his administration would buy half a billion rapid tests to distribute free to the public, and that insurance companies would begin reimbursing people for tests they purchased on their own. Mr. Biden said at the time that the free tests would be available “in the coming weeks.” With the Omicron variant of the coronavirus fueling a sharp rise in cases across the country, demand for all kinds of tests is far outpacing supply. In some areas, people are waiting in long lines to take the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., tests that are administered at medical clinics. Rapid at-home tests are flying off pharmacy shelves. “We know this remains frustrating for people getting tested in many parts of the country,” Mr. Zients said on Wednesday. “So we are working to do all we can.” The administration’s new “test to stay” guidance for schools, in which students exposed to the virus can remain in the classroom if they test negative, is among the factors driving up demand for the rapid tests. Last week, when Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, omitted a testing requirement from new isolation guidelines, she was greeted with a chorus of criticism from public health experts who said a negative test should be required before an infected person ends a five-day isolation period. On Tuesday, the C.D.C. amended the latest guidance — not to say that testing was required, but to say that people who wanted to end their isolation periods after five days and had access to tests may choose to take them. If the test results are positive, they should stay home for another five days, the guidance says; if negative, and their symptoms are resolving, they may go out, but should continue to wear masks in public for another five days. Addressing reporters on Wednesday, Dr. Walensky said she omitted a testing requirement from the guidance because rapid tests are not authorized by the Food and Drug Administration to determine whether someone is infectious to others; they are authorized merely to detect infection, and are meant to be used serially, as is the case in schools. But after the guidance was released, she said, “it became very clear that people were interested in using the rapid tests,” and since that was the case, she at least wanted to “provide guidance on how they should be used.” The recommendation for the general public is different from the one for health care workers, who are required to test negative before going back to work. Dr. Walensky said the C.D.C. was always more conservative in its recommendations for health workers, because they care for vulnerable people, including those with weak immune systems. Matching testing supply with demand has been a challenge for both the Trump and Biden administrations. Early in the pandemic, there was a shortage of tests and the components that make up test kits. By late 2020, manufacturers had expanded production. But once vaccines arrived, the Biden administration put less emphasis on testing. Demand plunged, and manufacturers pulled back. Now the manufacturers are running at full speed again. Mr. Zients said manufacturers would begin delivering rapid tests kits to the federal government next week, and that the administration would set up a “free and easy system, including a website” where Americans could order them. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Wednesday that new federal testing sites would open this week in the District of Columbia and Philadelphia, followed soon after by Maine, Maryland, Nevada, Delaware, Texas and Washington state. She noted that mobile testing sites were already open in New York City and New Jersey. LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday scaled back restrictions on people traveling to England as the Omicron variant appears to be so widespread that measures tightened in November can no longer stem the spread. Starting Friday, vaccinated travelers will no longer need to take a test before their journey, Mr. Johnson said in a statement to Parliament on Wednesday. They will still need to take one within two days of arrival, he said, though a rapid antigen test is enough. As of Sunday, the government will not require a more expensive P.C.R. test. The changes were welcomed by the country’s hard-hit aviation industry. Mr. Johnson defended the stricter travel restrictions that were put in place in late November, when the Omicron variant was first identified, as necessary to slow its arrival. “But now,” he said, “Omicron is so prevalent, these measures are having limited impact on the growth in cases, while continuing to pose significant costs on our travel industry.” The decision announced Wednesday effectively takes Britain back to the same rules it operated in October. But unvaccinated passengers will still be required to take a pre-departure test and to self-isolate on arrival for 10 days, during which time they must take two P.C.R. tests. There were 194,747 daily cases recorded in the United Kingdom, according to data released on Wednesday, near the record of 218,724 cases announced on Tuesday. Mr. Johnson’s announcement covered England only, but Wales said it would take a similar step, and Scotland and Northern Ireland were expected to follow suit. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, an industry body, said the relaxed rules were a “hugely welcome move at a critical time in the booking season for passengers.” The change would, he said in a statement, “provide a massive boost to those wanting to travel abroad or come to the U.K. this year.” He added, “People will now be able to book knowing that, for the fully vaccinated, all emergency testing restrictions have been removed.” PARIS — Faced with a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant, President Emmanuel Macron of France said Wednesday that he wanted to “piss off” millions of his citizens who refuse to get vaccinated by squeezing them out of the country’s public spaces. By shocking the nation with a vulgarity three months before presidential elections, Mr. Macron was relaying not only a public health message, but also a political one. He appeared to be calculating that tapping into the growing public anger against the unvaccinated held more potential electoral rewards than the risk of angering an anti-vaccination minority whose support he has little hope of ever getting. Using his harshest language yet to urge the recalcitrant to get their shots, Mr. Macron said he would not “throw them in prison” or “vaccinate them by force.” But he made it clear he meant to make their lives harder. In doing so, Mr. Macron, an inveterate political gambler who became the nation’s youngest leader ever five years ago, effectively kicked off his campaign for re-election Wednesday, drawing clear lines between his supporters and opponents. He also moved the focus of debate away from themes like immigration and Islam that have dominated the political race so far and that are advantageous to his strongest rivals, on the right and far right. Mr. Macron was clearly seeking to tap into a rich political vein that his counterparts have been more cautious to exploit: anger among the majority of vaccinated people at a minority who refuse to get vaccinated and disproportionately occupy hospital beds. More than 77 percent of French people, and 92 percent of those 12 and older, have received at least two doses, according to the government. “The unvaccinated, I really want to piss them off,” Mr. Macron said, using a French word that is more vulgar, explaining that a new, reinforced vaccine pass would make it impossible for the unvaccinated to go to restaurants and cafes, or the theater and cinemas. Their recalcitrance, as well as the surge in cases in France, is threatening to undermine his success so far in tackling the pandemic. RIO DE JANEIRO — While Rio de Janeiro’s renowned Carnival parade will go on, the city will cancel its street parties, which ordinarily draw millions of revelers, the mayor says, citing the Omicron variant. The freewheeling public celebrations “won’t be possible,” Mayor Eduardo Paes Casaid at a news conference on Tuesday. “It’s been decided: there won’t be street carnival in the tradition of the past.” Mr. Paes said the official parade, in which samba groups put on elaborately choreographed shows flanked by bleachers that seat 56,000 people, would be held, with some health precautions. Last year, Carnival was canceled in its entirely because of the pandemic, but for many Brazilians, the real show is the street parties, and Cariocas, as Rio residents are known, were devastated to learn that they would not take place. “I was very excited, very hopeful, for the 2022 Carnival, even more so after a year without Carnival,” said João Ramos, 26. Mr. Ramos, a designer, said that as soon as he read the news, he shared it with friends, who had already been discussing what costumes to wear. “It poured cold water on us, everyone was so sad,” he said. Still, Mr. Ramos said, the decision is understandable. Already the effect of year-end celebrations can be seen: The number of cases is ticking up again, after plunging for months. As Carnival approached, many Brazilians had begun cautiously rehearsing again, planning for that outburst of samba-fueled joy when they and millions of visitors take over public spaces and shake off the previous year’s sorrows. After two years of a pandemic, they said, it was sorely needed. “With most Brazilians fully immunized, we thought it was happening,” said Tatiana Paz, the organizer of one street performance group. “But then the situation worsened again, and there is nothing we can do about it.” Other major cities such as Olinda, São Luís, and Florianópolis have also canceled their carnival events in the past 24 hours. Rio canceled both the parade and the street parties in 2021, when Brazil’s death toll surged as its vaccination campaign was off to a slow start. But toward the end of the year, as shots became more widely available, Brazilians embraced them: About 68 percent of the country’s population is fully vaccinated, and the country’s caseload and death toll plunged. The period of relative calm that followed allowed the population to begin socializing again. Streets, beaches, and bars became packed as summer set in. On Copacabana beach, the sky was filled with fireworks as onlookers welcomed the New Year.  However, cases started rising again as Omicron spread around the world. Rio’s annual Carnival, considered to be one of the largest in the world, takes place in the weeks leading up to Ash Wednesday, the Western Christian holy day that marks the start of Lent. Ash Wednesday falls on March 2 this year. The city’s tradition, with its lively music and elaborate costumes, has endured and often thrived even in difficult times. Brazilians have danced through wars, hyperinflation, repressive military rule, runaway street violence and the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic. Official calls to postpone Carnival in Brazil in 1892 (for sanitation reasons) and 1912 (to mourn the death of a national hero) were largely ignored. In another city famous for Carnival, New Orleans, this year’s Mardi Gras parades appear to be moving forward. The event was canceled in 2021. For the second year in a row, the Grammy Awards have been pushed back by the coronavirus pandemic. The 64th annual ceremony, which had been set for Jan. 31 in Los Angeles, has been rescheduled, according to a joint statement on Wednesday from the Recording Academy and CBS, as the Omicron variant has led to a surge in cases nationwide. The new date will be announced soon, the statement said, noting, “The health and safety of those in our music community, the live audience, and the hundreds of people who work tirelessly to produce our show remains our top priority.” Last year’s show was postponed by six weeks as cases spiked, and before vaccinations were widely available. Last week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, predicted that the latest wave of the pandemic may reach its peak in the United States by the end of January. This year the composer and bandleader Jon Batiste has 11 Grammy nominations, more than any other artist, and will compete for both album and record of the year. Other top nominees include Olivia Rodrigo, Justin Bieber, Billie Eilish and Doja Cat. No performers have been announced yet. Gov. Kathy M. Hochul of New York said Wednesday that she would propose spending $10 billion to help rebuild a health care work force that has been exhausted and depleted by the nearly two-year-old pandemic. “We simply do not have enough health care workers in our hospitals, or in our long-term care facilities, in our ambulances, or in the homes of our loved ones,” the governor said in her first State of the State speech in Albany, labeling the moment a crisis.  The state health work force is about 6 percent smaller than it was before the pandemic. Even before the coronavirus strained the system, officials had projected the work force would need to grow by 11 percent by the end of 2022 to meet demand, the governor’s office reported. “We must stop the current hemorrhaging of health care workers,” Ms. Hochul said in her speech. “And we’re going to do it. Not just by saying we owe them a debt of gratitude, but actually paying them the debt we owe.” She proposed spending more than $4 billion to support wages and bonuses to increase the number of health care workers in the state by 20 percent over the next five years. That would include up to $3,000 in bonuses for all full-time health care workers who remain in their positions for a year, and $2 billion in spending on health care capital infrastructure and improved lab capacity. The governor also wants to offer free tuition to students who are preparing to work in high-demand health occupations and to provide stipends to make up for lost income while they are in school. Doctors could receive loan forgiveness up to $120,000 if they work in underserved areas for three years. She also wants to start a “Nurses Across N.Y.” Program to place nurses in underserved areas. Hospitals across the state are reporting that staffing is the biggest challenge of this stage of the pandemic, as new cases soared this week to levels not seen since the first wave in May 2020. The result has been packed emergency rooms and waits for beds at some institutions, though fewer patients are requiring intensive care because of vaccinations and what scientists say is the milder nature of the Omicron variant. As the governor spoke in Albany, the new mayor of New York, Eric Adams, laid out a plan to provide $111 million in new funding for the city’s public hospitals to help them cope with the surge in patients caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant. He also announced a $27 million loan program for the city’s so-called safety-net hospitals, which are outside the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation network. A small, new real-world study suggests that two widely used at-home antigen tests, the Abbott BinaxNow and Quidel QuickVue, may fail to detect Omicron infections when people are carrying high levels of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, focused on 30 people, who were most likely infected with Omicron, who tested positive for the virus at workplace surveillance programs. They took both saliva-based P.C.R. tests and rapid antigen tests using nasal swabs. It took three days, on average, for people to test positive on a rapid antigen test after their first positive P.C.R. result. In four cases, people transmitted the virus to others while the rapid test showed the negative result, the study noted. It is not clear whether the infections were missed because the antigen tests are inherently less sensitive for Omicron or because saliva samples may be a better way to detect the new variant. But the results suggest that the at-home tests that many Americans have come to rely on — at least as currently administered, with a nasal swab — may be failing to detect Omicron in the first days of infection. Anne Wyllie, a microbiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and a co-author of the study, urged people to interpret negative test results with caution. “People should not ignore high risk exposures,” she said. “They should not ignore symptoms.” Rapid antigen tests, which are designed to detect proteins on the surface of the coronavirus, have always been less sensitive than P.C.R. tests, which amplify the virus’s genetic material and can detect even very small traces of the virus. But in the new study, the rapid antigen tests failed to detect the virus even in people who had high viral loads, and who were thus likely to be infectious. The tests were done over a series of up to 10 days. The discordant results overwhelmingly came during the first three days of infection. The study, by researchers at the University of Washington, the Yale School of Public Health and others, concluded: “In real-world antigen testing, the limit of detection was substantially lower than manufacturers have reported to the F.D.A. based on laboratory validation.” In 29 of 30 people, samples of the virus produced a telltale genetic pattern on P.C.R. tests, suggesting that they were likely infected with Omicron. Although the study is small and has not yet been reviewed by experts, it fits with emerging research suggesting that some rapid antigen tests may be less sensitive to Omicron than to other variants. It is also consistent with a recent report from South Africa, which suggests that saliva samples might be a better way to detect Omicron than nasal swabs. The study comes a week after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released an update that made headlines by stating: “Early data suggests that antigen tests do detect the omicron variant but may have reduced sensitivity.” An Abbott spokesman, John Koval, said on Wednesday that the finding that a P.C.R. test is more sensitive is “not new.”  “Due to immediate turnaround time, frequent rapid antigen testing does slow transmission — and with a highly infectious variant frequent testing is needed, which is not realistic with P.C.R.,” he wrote in an email. Quidel’s president, Douglas Bryant, said in a statement that the company performed recent testing using samples from South Africa and confirmed that its rapid tests are detecting the Omicron variant. “The QuickVue antigen tests are able to detect the live Omicron variant with similar performance as with other variants,” he said. Hong Kong announced a series of strict pandemic control measures on Wednesday, including suspending flights from the United States and seven other countries, as it scrambled to contain an incipient coronavirus outbreak. The new measures came as the authorities held thousands of passengers of a cruise ship under mandatory quarantine to trace a Covid case. The flight bans will deepen the city’s isolation from the outside world and mark a return to the tough restrictions the city imposed in the early days of the pandemic. Hong Kong has largely brought the coronavirus under control, but the arrival of the highly transmissible Omicron variant threatens to set off the city’s fifth wave of the pandemic. “Given the very dire situation of the pandemic, we have to grasp this critical moment,” Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said at a news conference. Mrs. Lam had said on Tuesday that no new social distancing measures were expected. But the spread of Omicron, including the infection of a person with no clear connections to the city’s first detected Omicron cluster, evidently forced a change. “We have to contain the pandemic to make sure there will not be a major outbreak in the community again,” she said. “We are racing with Omicron.” The restrictions will make it even harder to enter Hong Kong, which already imposes some of the world’s longest quarantines — up to three weeks. Under the new rules, no flights will be allowed from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines or United States for two weeks, starting on Saturday. People who have recently been in those countries will also be barred from entering Hong Kong by other routes. Large public events will be canceled, and several types of public venues — including bars, gyms and karaoke parlors — will be closed. Visitors will be barred from hospitals and nursing homes for two weeks. Dining in restaurants after 6 p.m. will be banned. But the government decided not to stop in-person instruction in schools, or to require government officials to work from home. Hong Kong has reported a growing number of imported cases involving the Omicron variant, with 133 as of Tuesday.  “If this continues, there will be tremendous strain on our quarantine and health care facilities,” said Dr. Ronald Lam, Hong Kong’s director of health. An Omicron outbreak in the city has been traced to a Cathay Pacific flight attendant who ignored quarantine requirements after returning to the city from the United States. He dined at the Moon Palace restaurant in the upscale Fashion Walk shopping mall on Dec. 27, infecting his father and at least one other person, who then infected others. The restrictions came as Hong Kong health authorities on Wednesday ordered a Royal Caribbean cruise ship to return to port early as officials searched for the contacts of a Covid-19 patient. Nine people who boarded the ship, the Spectrum of the Seas, on Jan. 2 had come into contact with the patient, who did not board the ship, the government said in a statement. The nine were told to quarantine as soon as they were identified as contacts, though they preliminarily tested negative. The vessel, which was carrying about 2,500 guests and 1,200 staff members, was scheduled to return on Thursday but was back in port as ordered on Wednesday morning, a Royal Caribbean representative said. More than 3,000 passengers of the ship were subjected to mandatory quarantine, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said at a news conference on Wednesday. All crew members and guests 12 and older had to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and provide negative test results before boarding, the cruise line said in a statement. The passengers who sailed on the ship will receive a 25 percent refund on their cruise fare, it added. The cruise line also said that it had canceled another ship scheduled to depart on Thursday and that all guests who had booked it would receive a full refund. All nine of the justices on the Supreme Court have received booster shots of the coronavirus vaccine, a spokeswoman said. The justices have all been fully vaccinated since last March. The court is preparing to hear arguments on Friday in two major challenges to the Biden administration’s efforts to address the coronavirus in the workplace. As they have since the beginning of the current term in October, the justices will hear arguments on Friday in person in the Supreme Court’s courtroom. The courthouse remains closed to the public, and lawyers and credentialed journalists are required to wear N95 masks and to have recently received a negative test for the virus. The court does not require proof of vaccination. Friday’s arguments concern measures requiring vaccination or frequent testing of workers at large employers and vaccination of health care workers at facilities that receive federal money. The court will provide a live audio feed of the arguments on its website. The Sundance Film Festival announced Wednesday that it will cancel all in-person events set for Jan. 20-30. The news comes as virus cases are spiking because of the Omicron variant. The festival will now be virtual for a second year in a row. Sundance, in a news release, said it was “a difficult decision” to cancel its first hybrid festival, which would have allowed patrons to watch films either in-person in Park City, Utah, or online via a portal. The release noted that with case numbers expected to peak in Park City and the surrounding Summit County during the week of the festival, “we cannot knowingly put our staff and community at risk. The undue stress to Summit County’s health services and our more than 1,500 staff and volunteers would be irresponsible in this climate.” The news follows the announcement earlier today that the Recording Academy would postpone the Grammys, set to take place Jan. 31 in Los Angeles. In recent weeks, the Palm Springs International Film Festival canceled its event, and both the American Film Institute awards luncheon and the Critics Choice Awards, set for January, were postponed. Last year was the first time Sundance held a completely virtual event. The multiday affair was deemed a success considering the circumstances and generated one of the highest sales in the festival’s history when Apple paid $25 million for the film “CODA,” which is now looking for recognition in the awards race. The World Health Organization says that it is monitoring a coronavirus variant detected in a small number of patients in France, but that, for now, there is little reason to worry about its spread. The B.1.640.2 variant was first identified in October and uploaded to Gisaid, a database for disease variants, on Nov. 4. Only about 20 samples have been sequenced so far, experts said this week, and only one since early December. Abdi Mahmud, a Covid incident manager with the W.H.O., told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday that the variant had been on the agency’s radar since November, but added that it did not appear to have spread widely over the past two months. “That virus has had a lot of chances to pick up,” he said. By contrast, the Omicron variant, which was first uploaded to Gisaid on Nov. 23, has more than 120,000 sequences in the database. (The vast majority of Omicron cases have not been sequenced.) It has been detected in at least 128 countries, according to the W.H.O., and is fueling record-high case numbers in many parts of the world. Concerns over the variant in France arose after researchers found that it contained 46 mutations that differed from the original version of the coronavirus. Omicron also has a high number of mutations, which researchers believe made it far more transmissible. According to a research paper that was published on a preprint server in late December, but that has not been peer-reviewed, the B.1.640.2 variant was first detected in southeastern France in a vaccinated person who had recently traveled from Cameroon. Researchers found a total of 12 cases in the area and named the variant “I.H.U.,” after the research institute in Marseille that helped identify it. “It is too early to speculate on virological, epidemiological or clinical features of this I.H.U. variant based on these 12 cases,” researchers wrote. Numerous coronavirus variants have emerged over the past two years, and the reasons that some spread widely while others do not are complex. For now, several independent researchers say there is little reason to be concerned about the I.H.U. variant. Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College in London, tweeted this week that, so far, “this virus has had a decent chance to cause trouble but never really materialised.” After going virtual last year, CES, a mega-conference in Las Vegas that’s the traditional launchpad for many of the tech industry’s latest gadgets, is trying to make a comeback. The trade show kicks off on Wednesday, with an estimated 2,200 exhibitors set to show up in person. But with the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus surging, scores of major tech companies are still presenting mostly virtually. It’s a sign that decisions to hold big in-person events at this phase of the pandemic remain far from clear-cut, the DealBook newsletter reports. Yet the organizers of CES — like those of the Winter Olympics and the Australian Open, which are set to begin soon — have decided it’s time to gather in person again. Canceling the show would “hurt thousands of smaller companies, entrepreneurs and innovators” who depend on the show to introduce their products, Gary Shapiro, the chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, the trade group that organizes CES, wrote in an opinion column in The Las Vegas Review-Journal. (The conference is also important for Las Vegas, which reaped an estimated $291 million from spending tied to it in 2020.) Mr. Shapiro noted that the conference had embraced pandemic protections like requiring attendees to be fully vaccinated and masked while on the show floor, and that testing was readily available. But many large companies have chosen to attend remotely, including Amazon, AMD, AT&T, General Motors, Google, Intel, Lenovo, Meta, Nvidia, Pinterest, T-Mobile and Twitter. That will leave “big gaps on the show floor,” Mr. Shapiro said. And CES will end a day early, in what the organizers said was a concession to safety. Other big events are delaying their return to in-person gatherings. The World Economic Forum postponed its annual confab in Davos, Switzerland, which was set to take place this month. So is it safe to hold live in-person events again? Omicron cases appear to be less severe than cases from previous variants, and vaccines and new treatments are becoming available. More governments are also edging toward managing, not containing, the coronavirus, and are increasingly reluctant to reimpose restrictions. That could mean that a return to regular mass gatherings in some places may not be far-off. In hospitals around the country, doctors are taking notice: This wave of Covid seems different from the last one. Once again, as they face the highly contagious Omicron variant, medical personnel are exhausted and are contracting the virus themselves. And the numbers of patients entering hospitals with the variant are surging to staggering levels, filling up badly needed beds, delaying nonemergency procedures and increasing the risk that vulnerable uninfected patients will catch the virus. But in Omicron hot spots from New York to Florida to Texas, a smaller proportion of those patients are landing in intensive care units or requiring mechanical ventilation, doctors said. And many — roughly 50 to 65 percent of admissions in some New York hospitals — show up at the hospital for other ailments and then test positive for the virus. “We are seeing an increase in the number of hospitalizations,” said Dr. Rahul Sharma, emergency physician in chief for NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital. But the severity of the disease looks different from previous waves, he said. “We’re not sending as many patients to the I.C.U., we’re not intubating as many patients, and actually, most of our patients that are coming to the emergency department that do test positive are actually being discharged.” Though it’s still early for firm predictions, the shift in hospital patterns fits with emerging data that Omicron may be a variant with inherently milder effects than those that have come before, less prone to infecting the lungs, where it can cause serious disease. But the lower proportion of severe cases is also happening because, compared with previous variants, Omicron is infecting more people who have some prior immunity, whether through prior infection or vaccination. The vast majority of Omicron patients in I.C.U.s are unvaccinated or have severely compromised immune systems, doctors said. Hospitals, facing staff shortages, are under enormous strain. In New York City, hospitalizations have exceeded the peak of last winter’s surge. And Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, noting that the state had more hospitalized Covid-19 patients at that time than at any previous point during the pandemic. “We’re in truly crushed mode,” said Dr. Gabe Kelen, director of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s emergency department. The number of I.C.U. patients is a lagging indicator, likely to rise in the coming weeks, experts said. What’s more, some states are still struggling under the crush of hospitalizations from Delta, a previous version of the virus that may be more virulent. (Hospitals are frequently in the dark about which variant newly admitted patients are infected with.) NEW DELHI — When the Omicron coronavirus variant spread through India late in December, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged the nation to be vigilant and follow medical guidelines. Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of the capital region of Delhi, swiftly introduced night curfews, shut down movie theaters, and slashed restaurants and public transport to half capacity. Then, both men hit the campaign trail, often appearing without masks in packed rallies of thousands. “When it is our bread and butter at stake, they force restrictions and lockdowns,” said Ajay Tiwari, a 41-year-old taxi driver in New Delhi. “There are much bigger crowds at political rallies, but they don’t impose any lockdown in those areas. It really pains us deep in the heart.” As Omicron fuels a rapid spread of new infections through India’s major urban hubs, the country’s pandemic fatigue has been intensified by a sense of déjà vu and the frustration of mixed signals. It has been just a few months since the deadly Delta variant ravaged the country, when government leaders vastly underestimated its threat and publicly flouted their own advice. The memories of overwhelmed hospitals and funeral pyres working around the clock are still all too fresh here. The metropolis of Mumbai on Wednesday reported more than 15,000 new infections in 24 hours — the highest daily caseload since the pandemic began, beating the city’s previous record of about 11,000 cases during the second wave in the spring. In New Delhi, the number of daily infections increased by nearly 100 percent overnight. The sheer size of India’s population, at 1.4 billion, has always kept experts wary about the prospects of a new coronavirus variant. In few places around world was the toll of Delta as stark as in India. The country’s official figures show about half a million pandemic deaths — a number that experts say vastly undercounts the real toll. WASHINGTON — President Biden came into office vowing to restore public trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after the Trump White House had tied the agency’s hands and manipulated its scientific judgments on the pandemic for political ends. Yet in his first year, Mr. Biden has presided over a series of messaging failures that have followed a familiar pattern, with the agency’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, and her team making what experts say are largely sound decisions, but fumbling in communicating them to America. Dr. Walensky, a highly regarded infectious disease expert from Boston with no prior government experience, insisted in February that schools must keep students six feet apart; in March, she said three feet was enough. She said in February that teachers did not need to be vaccinated to reopen schools; the White House said the next day that she was speaking “in her personal capacity.” In May, she said that vaccinated people generally did not need to wear masks in public, a sudden change that flummoxed state health officials. Two months later, she reversed that guidance after it was shown that vaccinated people could still transmit the coronavirus. More recently, with the Omicron variant driving a near vertical rise in cases, Dr. Walensky alerted the White House that she planned to recommend that people infected with the virus isolate for five days instead of 10. To avoid another messaging fiasco, she briefed other top Biden health officials on her proposal so they would all be on the same page, according to two people familiar with her actions. But both Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, and Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, the surgeon general, took issue on national television with the agency’s policy of not requiring a negative Covid test before ending the shorter isolation. Dr. Tom Frieden, the agency’s director under President Barack Obama, said he did not believe the latest recommendations on isolation were significantly wrong, but “the way they were released was very problematic.” The crux of the problem, several administration officials said, is a failure by the C.D.C. and the Biden administration’s messaging experts to work in concert. Dr. Walensky’s critics say she is not collaborative enough, too often springing decisions on other federal officials who then struggle to defend them in public. Her defenders say that she strives to coordinate, but that it is not her job to ensure consensus across the entire administration. Some suggest the White House has gone too far in its hands-off, let-the-scientists-rule approach, leaving a vacuum of leadership and forcing ad hoc coordination between the various public health agencies. On the day President Biden was inaugurated, the advisory board of health experts who counseled him during his transition officially ceased to exist. But its members have quietly continued to meet regularly over Zoom, their conversations often turning to frustration with Mr. Biden’s coronavirus response. Now, six of these former advisers have gone public with an extraordinary, albeit polite, critique — and a plea to be heard. In three opinion articles published on Thursday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, they called for Mr. Biden to adopt an entirely new domestic pandemic strategy geared to the “new normal” of living with the virus indefinitely, not to wiping it out. The authors are all big names in American medicine. Several, including Dr. Luciana Borio, a former acting chief scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, and Dr. David Michaels, a former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration now with George Washington University’s School of Public Health, have held high-ranking government positions. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist, medical ethicist and University of Pennsylvania professor who advised former President Barack Obama, organized the effort. Like any White House, Mr. Biden’s prizes loyalty and prefers to keep its differences in house; in that regard, the articles are an unusual step. The authors say they wrote them partly because they have not made headway talking directly to White House officials. “From a macroperspective, it feels like we are always fighting yesterday’s crisis and not necessarily thinking what needs to be done today to prepare us for what comes next,” Dr. Borio said. The authors shared the articles with White House officials before they were published, but it was unclear whether the administration would adopt any of their suggestions. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, Mr. Biden’s top medical adviser for the pandemic, declined to comment on the articles. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters she had not read the articles, and dismissed a question about whether the president “is coming around to accepting” that Covid-19 is here to stay, even though several recent media accounts suggested that the administration was beginning to operate under that assumption. Mr. Biden’s recent emphasis on keeping schools open and businesses running even when cases are soaring also suggests a recalibration, as does a recent decision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend that people with Covid isolate for five days instead of 10."

Read more in a note from Times Opinion’s politics editor Ezekiel Kweku in our Opinion Today newsletter. It’s Election Day 2024. President Biden and former President Donald Trump have been locked in battle for months, with Mr. Biden holding a stable, sizable lead in the popular vote but much narrower leads in key swing states like Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona. Turnout has been exceptionally high, nearly matching 2020 levels. The outcome will clearly come down to those three key states — all with Republican legislative majorities that put in place laws making them the final arbiters of electoral disputes. As the counting in the three proceeds, Democratic Party representatives raise a hue and cry that it is proceeding unfairly, with significant numbers of valid ballots being rejected without proper cause. State election officials (mostly pro-Trump Republicans) declare that there is no substance to these objections. All three conclude that Mr. Trump won their states’ electors, and with them the presidency. Is it likely that Democratic voters would accept this result without protest and a constitutional crisis (and perhaps even violent protest)? I think the answer is no, and I suspect most Democrats reading this would agree with me. And that’s why, notwithstanding all the good arguments for reforming our electoral system, there is no legislative solution to the deepest problem threatening American democracy: the profound lack of trust in the legitimacy of the opposition. The scenario I described above is precisely what multiple observers have been warning about in the year since the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Republican legislatures in several states have revised their election statutes to give themselves more authority over the conduct of elections in their states, reducing the authorities of state secretaries of state, governors and county election officials in the process. From the perspective of anyone who isn’t a Republican, those moves look like preparation to commit fraud and to do so with legal impunity. Many of those legislators, however, will say that their moves are intended to shore up confidence in the electoral system — that they are, in fact, a response to those same terrible events of Jan. 6. Their voters believe — wrongly, as at least a few of those same Republican officials will admit — that the 2020 election was decided unfairly, on the basis of fraudulent votes. At a minimum, more and more mainstream Republicans are arguing, voting procedures were capriciously changed by biased election officials and judges using the pandemic as an excuse in a way that unfairly advantaged Democrats. Therefore, they need to take these kinds of steps to convince their voters that the election will be conducted fairly. Perhaps they are right that this is what it would take to convince their voters. If they are, though, they will succeed only by undermining the confidence of the other party in those same election results. The same, sadly, is likely true of proposed Democratic attempts to shore up confidence in the electoral system. It seems to have been largely forgotten, but in 2020, despite extraordinary strain, the system worked. As independent observers have attested, no meaningful fraud marred the election. Turnout was extremely high for both parties despite pandemic conditions, attesting to the lack of effective voter suppression as well. Republican officeholders at all levels of government were pressed to find fraud that didn’t exist, to decertify valid results and otherwise to undermine the integrity of the election. They overwhelmingly resisted that pressure. The same is true of the judicial branch, which rejected out of hand the Trump campaign’s spurious legal challenges. None of that, however, was sufficient to persuade tens of millions of Trump voters that their candidate actually lost. On the contrary: When forced to choose between President Trump’s baseless assertions and the conclusions of those Republicans duly charged with overseeing the election, these voters chose Mr. Trump over members of their own party who acted with integrity. The rioters on Jan. 6 turned to violence because they believed that the election was stolen, and they believed that despite all the authorities, Democrats and Republicans, actually responsible for running it saying otherwise. That’s not a problem that can be solved by tinkering with the mechanics of elections oversight. It’s entirely possible that worthwhile reforms to limit political grandstanding could fuel distrust by Democrats in the legitimacy of elections. Take the Electoral Count Act, a particular focus of concern because of John Eastman’s memo suggesting, absurdly, that it granted Vice President Mike Pence the authority to unilaterally set aside certified electoral votes. The act was originally passed to prevent a repeat of the disputed election of 1876, during which Congress — previously responsible for resolving such disputes — deadlocked over which electors to approve from three states that submitted dueling slates. The act reduced Congress’s role and aimed to provide clear rules for how and when states must approve their slates to avoid disputes. Those provisions can — and should — be clarified, to eliminate the possibility that a future vice president might do what Mike Pence refused to, or that future representatives and senators could baselessly undermine popular confidence in election integrity as numerous Republicans have done in the wake of the last election. But what any such reform would do is push more authority back down to the state level or over to the judicial branch. What happens if those actors behave in a corruptly partisan manner? With key state legislatures in Republican hands and with the Supreme Court dominated by Republican appointees inclined to give latitude to those same state legislatures in setting electoral rules, it’s not hard to imagine many Democrats in 2024 concluding that by reforming the act they had disarmed themselves. Some Democrats, therefore, have called for federalizing America’s unusually decentralized national elections, to override the possibility of partisan state legislature interference in either the conduct of the election or the vote count and certification of the winners. Because the Constitution vests a great deal of authority at the state level, some of these proposals might well face constitutional challenges — but even if they passed muster, what would they achieve? They would invest more power in Congress, which might well be in Republican hands. How confident would Democrats be in an election in 2024 ultimately overseen by Kevin McCarthy in the House and Mitch McConnell in the Senate? Nor would investing that power in another state-level authority be assured to fare better. After the 2020 election, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, was a hero for refusing to compromise his integrity. But in the 2000 election, the independent authority responsible for running the election in Florida was Secretary of State Katherine Harris, a Republican who was widely distrusted by Democrats for what they saw as favoritism to George W. Bush. This distrust was a mirror of Republicans’ own distrust of the recount process as conducted in a number of Democratically controlled counties in South Florida. It was distrust all the way up and all the way down. It ended only because Al Gore accepted the authority of the Supreme Court. There are potential reforms that could significantly improve the democratic accountability of our system and reduce the scope for either party to skew the process. Taking redistricting out of the hands of state legislatures and entrusting it to nonpartisan bodies is an obvious example. Breaking up the largest states, or creating multimember congressional districts, are more profound reforms that could empower currently underrepresented political minorities from both camps. There are likely deals to strike on voting rights that could provide better security against both fraud and suppression. Such reforms, however, will never be trusted if they are enacted on a purely partisan basis to plainly partisan ends. Even if they are responding to real distortions, and are formally neutral, they will be perceived and opposed as illegitimate partisan grabs if they aren’t undertaken cooperatively. They won’t break the cycle of distrust or prevent a recurrence of Jan. 6 any more than widespread agreement among nonpartisan observers that the 2020 election was fair did so. The problem is not that America is incapable of conducting an election with integrity. We just did, under some of the most difficult conditions. The problem is that too many Americans — predominantly Republicans today, but perhaps Democrats tomorrow — do not believe or accept the results, and that their leaders — again, predominantly Republicans today, but perhaps Democrats tomorrow — are willing and eager to cater to that mistaken conviction. That’s a problem that can’t be legislated away. It can be resolved only by the parties themselves committing that demagogy will stop at the election’s edge. Until that happens, American democracy will be in crisis, no matter what laws we pass to protect it."

The statement said the royal couple had “isolated themselves in the home in accordance with current rules of conduct, and infection tracking is ongoing.” The king and queen join a growing list of European royalty who have tested positive in recent weeks, including Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands, and Princess Anne of Britain. Sweden has been something of an outlier in Europe in its response to the pandemic. While other European nations were imposing lockdowns in March 2020, hoping to flatten a steeply rising curve of new infections, Sweden kept the country open and asked residents to follow health precautions voluntarily. Though Sweden remained better off than some countries that enforced strict lockdowns, the early months of the pandemic were far deadlier in Sweden than in many of its neighbors, and by December 2020 King Carl XVI Gustaf was calling the nation’s coronavirus policies a failure because of the lost lives. Since then, Sweden has seen major surges in cases in the winter and spring of 2021, and new cases are soaring again now as the highly transmissible Omicron variant spreads in much of the world."

Now I am single again. But I am not alone. My marriage ended during the pandemic, while I was at home with family. Since the pandemic began, my daughter and I have been living in what my family jokingly calls “the compound” — a house my mother and I bought together before I was married. She and my siblings and their families live there, in an attempt to withstand the waves of gentrification that have displaced everyone in my family every four to five years, as the sketchy neighborhoods we can afford get “discovered” by rich young people. The compound is a noisy place. Sometimes, when everyone is talking and laughing and joking at once, my daughter, who is young enough that language is still new to her, will raise her voice in a keening screech to try to join in the cacophony. Living with all this noise has stirred up many emotions: gratitude to my family for their support, the irritation of adolescence as we sometimes catch ourselves in the dances of our older selves; a longing for sleep that can only be felt in a household full of children who are all awake and ready to play by 6:30 a.m. on a Saturday. What has not materialized is the intense loneliness that people warned me would come with divorce. It was always interesting, telling people about the divorce. Some friends with small children almost panicked about what would come, about how the separation was too rash. But I am lucky in that most of my friends have lived lives falling in and out of partnerships. “You can go it alone, you know” was the much more common response. We are living through a time when all the stories the larger culture tells us about ourselves are being rewritten: the story of what the United States is; what it means to be a man or a woman; what it means to be a child; what it means to love oneself or other people. We are imagining all of this again so that these stories can guide and comfort us rather than control us. It’s a different world from the one my parents inhabited when they divorced, one in which many people treated their separation as if it were an infectious disease and shunned us for a number of years. There was the way people spoke to me when they thought my parents were married and the way the tone shifted when they figured out my mother was now alone. A distinct refrain, when growing up: “It’s really just your mother and you all?” Even as a child, I bristled at the assumptions behind that question. It seemed obvious to me then, having lived in a two-parent home that was deeply unhappy and dysfunctional, that the number of parents around to make a working family was arbitrary, that people beholden to the rigid mathematics of mother and father and children equals stability were shortsighted, ignoring all we know of human interactions and ways we make family throughout human history. To believe that one equation would work for us all seemed so simplistic and childish that for much of my young adulthood, I simply disregarded it. But the cultural myths around coupledom are hard to resist. It was easy, in childhood, to simply decide there must be another way. It was harder, in adulthood, after years spent marinating in so many cultural stories about what marriage could promise — legitimacy, maturity, stability, strength — to resist that programming. Marriage, of course, can be all those things to many people, but my own brought something different, which has led to this desire to be alone again. There is a lot of hand-wringing currently about the decline of marriage in America. No matter that divorce rates have also gone down, and that when people are marrying, it is at later ages. Our culture may have changed to allow other ways for people to chart their lives, but whole industries and institutions — banking, real estate, health care, insurance, advertising and most important, taxation — revolve around assumptions of marriage as the norm. Without that base assumption, the logic of many of those transactions is thrown out. It can feel daunting to come up with new narratives about what it means to mature — to be worthy of housing and financial stability and health care, to find companionship or emotional support — when these industries have so much invested, both financially and ideologically, in a particular way of measuring life and community. In search of new narratives, I have found myself drawn to Diane di Prima’s 2001 memoir, “Recollections of My Life as a Woman.” It focuses on her childhood and life in New York — a portrait of the artist as a young woman, in all her romantic and intuitive glory. Ms. di Prima is remarkable because as a poet in her early 20s in 1950s New York, she decided she wanted to be a mother, and a single mother at that. “I was a poet,” she wrote, continuing, “There was nothing that I could possibly experience, as a human in a female body, that I would not experience …. There should, it seemed to me, be no quarrel between these two aims: to have a baby and to be a poet.” Nevertheless, she continued, “A conflict held me fast.” Her memoir revolves around this conflict between motherhood and the demands of an artist. At a certain point, overwhelmed by the demands of parenting children alone while running a press, founding an avant-garde theater, protecting her left-wing friends from raids by the F.B.I. and the grinding poverty of an artist’s life in New York City, Ms. di Prima entered into a marriage of convenience with a man she distrusted. He was the ex-boyfriend of her male best friend. Besides its messy origins, this relationship resembles the dream I’ve heard so many straight women describe, in a joking, not joking way — wishing to start a family with a friend, to avoid the complications of romantic love. But Ms. di Prima is honest about the limitations of the arrangement. She wrote that she avoided the pains of romance, but the man she married is still a domineering, abusive mess, in her recounting. Furthermore, in marriage, she has lost something integral to herself. “One of my most precious and valued possessions was my independence: my struggle for control over my own life,” she wrote, continuing, “I didn’t see that it had no intrinsic value for anyone but myself, that it was a coin that was precious only within the realm, a currency that could not cross borders.” These words, when I read them, sounded in me like the chime of a tuning fork. I had never before read such a precise description of what marriage asks some people to give up. Those who panic over the rise in the number of single Americans do not see that this statistic includes lives of hard-won independence — lives that still intersect with a community, with a home, with a belief in something wider than oneself. The people clinging to old narratives around singledom and marriage can’t yet see these lives for what they are because, as Ms. di Prima puts it, they are not “an objectively valuable commodity.” Their meaning is “a currency that cannot cross borders.” These lives threaten the communal narratives currently in place. But what is a threat to some can be to others a glimmer of a new world coming."

In Almaty, the country’s largest city, police fired tear gas and stun grenades at crowds of thousands of people who had refused to disperse, as protesters set police cars alight, according to wire services. The protests, which began on Sunday, represent a rare manifestation of dissent in Kazakhstan, an oil-rich authoritarian country in Central Asia. “Dear compatriots, I urge you to show prudence and not succumb to provocations from within and from without, to the euphoria of rallies and permissiveness,” President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said in a video address Tuesday evening. “Calls to attack civilian and military offices are completely illegal. This is a crime that comes with a punishment.” Early on Wednesday, Mr. Tokayev announced the resignation of the Kazakh government on the president’s website. He has no political opposition in Parliament. The state of emergency includes an 11 p.m.-to-7 a.m. curfew; restrictions on movement, including curbing entry to and exiting from the city of Almaty; and a ban on mass gatherings, according to a document published on the president’s website. Public protests without a permit are illegal. The declaration was made after several days of growing protests over the rise in prices for liquefied petroleum gas, or L.P.G., a low-carbon fuel that many Kazakhs use to power their cars. The government has argued that the price caps were financially unsustainable and lifted them effective Jan. 1. The turn to the free market essentially doubled the cost of the fuel overnight. The protests began on Sunday in the southwestern oil town of Zhanozen, the same place where 16 striking oil workers were killed in 2011 by police after they demanded improved working conditions. (Human rights experts estimate the number of casualties could be several times higher.) In Aktau, the capital of the resource-rich Mangystau region, 16,000 people protested Tuesday, according to the Russian news agency Interfax, while 10,000 gathered in Zhanozen. In his speech, Mr. Tokayev said the government would again cap the L.P.G. price at 50 tenge ($0.11) per liter, less than half the current market price. But he also said no dissent would be brooked, urging young people “not to spoil their paths in life” and “not to poison the lives of loved ones.” Access to mobile internet was down and messaging apps including WhatsApp, Facebook and Telegram were blocked. Kazakhstan is the world’s largest landlocked country, bigger than the whole of Western Europe, with a population of about 19 million. Its gross domestic product per capita in 2020 was just above $9,000, according to the World Bank. Mr. Tokayev, who became president in 2019, is widely perceived as the handpicked successor of Nursultan Nazarbayev, a former Communist Party boss who had run Kazakhstan since its independence from the Soviet Union. The 81-year old Mr. Nazarbayev still wields tremendous power, holding the title “Leader of the Nation” and serving as chairman of the country’s Security Council. By Tuesday, it was evident the demonstrators had moved beyond the fuel prices to demanding the removal of Mr. Nazarbayev from public life. In Aktau, protesters were shouting “Old man out!”"

So here’s what we know so far. The opening ceremony is scheduled for Feb. 4, a Friday, though some preliminary events will be held in the days before. The closing ceremony is Feb. 20, a Sunday. In all, there will be 19 days of competition across 15 sports. This year’s Paralympics, also based in Beijing, are scheduled for March 4 to 13. Anything is possible, but the International Olympic Committee and Olympic organizers in Beijing have gone out of their way to emphasize that the Games will go on as planned. Asked in early December whether he could envision a situation in which the Games had to be postponed, Juan Antonio Samaranch, a top Olympic official, was blunt. “The answer is no,” he said. “In a Covid world, you have to be flexible, and you have to be able to adapt rapidly to changing conditions. We have that in Beijing.” The protocols will be similar to those at the Tokyo Olympics last summer, but more stringent. Organizers are creating what they’re calling a “closed-loop system” — also known as a bubble — in which thousands of athletes, coaches, team officials, Olympic staff members, contractors, volunteers and journalists will be confined for the duration of the Games. The bubble will include competition sites, hotels and other lodging for athletes, media facilities and a transportation network. No one else goes in; no one comes out. Everybody at the Olympics will be required to be vaccinated. (Medical exemptions are available, but anyone who gets one will have to quarantine for an impractical 21 days before competing.) And once there, everyone will be tested every day. A lot of countries, initially, had raised their hands to host the 2022 Games. But over time, one by one, they dropped out — countries like Norway, Sweden, Poland, Ukraine, Switzerland, Germany — in many cases citing the high cost of hosting the Olympics and a lack of popular support back home. Eventually, China and Kazakhstan were the only two bidders left. Beijing won by four votes. The host selection process was deemed such a disaster that the I.O.C. went on to scrap it. Host cities are now selected through a closed-door process. Not much. Two cities northwest of the capital, Yanqing and Zhangjiakou, will host the outdoor skiing events — but even that area normally receives only two inches of snow a year. The rest of the snow will be created artificially. Professional skiers are used to competing on artificial snow, especially in a warming world, though artificial snow can also worsen the environmental impact of ski runs. China’s record on human rights, including the abuse of Uyghur Muslims in the country’s Xinjiang region and the suppression of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, has led activists around the world to call for countries and sponsors to boycott the Beijing Games. The calls intensified in November with the disappearance from public life of Peng Shuai, a Chinese tennis player and three-time Olympian, after she accused a former top government official of sexual assault. But the possibility that any country boycotts the Beijing Olympics outright — that is, refuses to send its athletes to compete — feels remote. Instead, several countries, including the United States, Australia, Britain and Canada, have announced a “diplomatic boycott” of the Games, meaning their government officials will not attend any ceremonies or events. “We will not be contributing to the fanfare of the Games,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said about the decision. “That is a hypothetical question,” an I.O.C. spokesman, Mark Adams, said when asked that question in early December, pointing out that athletes could express personal views in interviews during the Games and on social media. The I.O.C. loosened its rules around protests and political displays before the Tokyo Olympics last summer, allowing athletes to make symbolic gestures — raising a fist or taking a knee, for example — in the arenas before their competitions. (Protesting during medal ceremonies is still not allowed.) But it remains to be seen what would happen if an athlete were to criticize, say, the Chinese government explicitly during the Games. “I think we have to wait for concrete examples,” Adams said. Most likely yes, but only in a limited capacity. Though fans were barred from venues in Tokyo last summer, organizers are hoping to allow at least some spectators from China to attend events in Beijing. Chinese officials have laid out strict rules to try to limit the spread of the virus, among them that spectators will be allowed to clap but not shout. Overseas spectators will not be allowed to enter the country. No. That’s a reversal of plans announced in September that would have allowed the stars to head to Beijing while the league shut down for three weeks. But with concerns rising about the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, the league and its players’ union pulled out of the Games and may use the time in February to make up postponed N.H.L. games. The Olympic men’s hockey tournament will now most likely feature minor leaguers and those who play in other organizations. As has been true for every Olympics this century, NBC will broadcast the Games in the United States. Coverage can also be found on various cable channels owned by the company, on NBCOlympics.com and on Peacock, the company’s streaming service. Eurosport will carry the Games in Europe, often in partnership with national broadcasters like the BBC. TSN, RDS and the CBC will show the Games in Canada, and Seven Network in Australia. A schedule of Olympic events is here. Beijing is 13 hours ahead of Eastern time (you can check your time zone here). That means many big events will be at awkward times for Americans: Women’s figure skating on Feb. 17 ends about 9 a.m. in New York and 6 a.m. in Los Angeles, and the men’s hockey final on Feb. 20 in Beijing begins after 11 p.m. on Feb. 19 in New York. The opening ceremony will most likely take place in prime time in Beijing, which is the morning in the United States. There are seven additions to the program for the 2022 Olympics. The most compelling among them could be the monobob, a women’s solo bobsledding event. These are the other events making their debut at the Games: There are fewer disciplines than in the Summer Olympics. The Winter Games include Alpine skiing, biathlon, bobsled, cross-country skiing, curling, figure skating, freestyle skiing, ice hockey, luge, Nordic combined, skeleton, ski jumping, snowboarding and speedskating. Here’s more about all of them. There is no prize money from the International Olympic Committee for winners. But many national federations give payments to athletes for winning medals. Some of the bonuses are substantial: Singapore’s $1 million in local currency (roughly $740,000 in the United States) for a gold medal is the largest known reward. Some are more modest: A U.S. medalist receives $37,500 for gold, $22,500 for silver and $15,000 for bronze. Other bonuses are nonexistent, such as those for medalists from Britain, New Zealand and Norway. Many athletes have later sold their medals to collectors, some citing financial hardships, others seeking to raise money for charity. The prices of old medals at auction vary quite a bit. After a global call for ideas which attracted more than 5,800 submissions, the organizers of the Games unveiled Bing Dwen Dwen, a cuddly panda who wears a suit made of ice. Shuey Rhon Rhon, an anthropomorphic lantern, is the Beijing Paralympics mascot. (Maybe they will have a bigger presence than the mascots for last year’s Tokyo Games, who often seemed to be missing in action.) The five rings, of blue, yellow, black, green and red, date to 1912 and were designed by the modern Games’ founder, Pierre de Coubertin. The colors were chosen so that every flag in the world would have at least one matching color. The reason there are five rings is murky: They may represent five continents, or the five Olympic Games that had been staged at the time they were designed. There is no particular meaning for any individual ring. The next Summer Olympics will be in Paris in 2024. The 2026 Winter Games will take place in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy. The Summer Games will then head to Los Angeles in 2028 and Brisbane, Australia, in 2032. The host of the 2030 Winter Games will be selected in 2023."

Union members had criticized the district’s response to the Omicron variant, which has pushed cases in the city to record levels, and said conditions in classrooms were unsafe. The Chicago Teachers Union said late Tuesday night that 73 percent of members who voted favored pausing in-person instruction. But Mayor Lori Lightfoot said reverting to online schooling was unacceptable and unnecessary, and her administration decided to call off class altogether — keeping the buildings open for emergency child care — rather than return to virtual instruction. “Nobody signs up for being a home-schooler at the last minute,” Ms. Lightfoot said. “We can’t forget about how disruptive that remote process is to individual parents who have to work, who can’t afford the luxury of staying home.” Ms. Lightfoot, a Democrat, urged teachers to report to work and suggested they were considering an illegal work stoppage. As highly contagious Omicron rears its head, so do debates that were considered settled. After a relatively calm fall, when school administrators, unions and families largely agreed that remote schooling was a nonstarter, the brinkmanship between the third-largest U.S. district and its union exposes just how quickly that political consensus can fall away. Like other school systems, Chicago has had to confront a shortage of tests, and a far from universal vaccination rate among students. There have been large numbers of staff members calling in sick, and widespread anxiety among just about everyone. Other districts, including in Cleveland, Milwaukee and Atlanta, have also gone online temporarily, but without a public labor dispute. The ongoing chaos has unnerved parents who are desperate for some kind of stability. Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Chicago to their highest rate since the pandemic began. But as in the rest of the country, vaccinated adults have had lower rates of hospitalization and death, while children of all ages — regardless of vaccination status — have overwhelmingly been spared severe outcomes. In addition, data from Chicago and elsewhere shows that in-school transmission of the coronavirus has been limited, with a majority of teacher and student cases originating outside school buildings. More than 90 percent of Chicago Public Schools employees are fully vaccinated. Still, members of the powerful Chicago Teachers Union have accused the school district of failing to adjust to Omicron, and the growing threat of breakthrough infections. During the holiday break, they had asked for either universal P.C.R. testing of students and staff or a two-week transition to remote learning. “We are between a rock and a hard place — the rock being the pandemic, the hard place being an intractable, incompetent mayor,” Stacy Davis Gates, the union’s vice president, said this week. She added, “We said a two-week pause so they could get themselves together, have the proper communication, put in the necessary mitigations.” Despite sharp criticism, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday stood by its recommendation that Americans infected with the coronavirus end their isolation after five days without first obtaining a negative virus test. The agency guidelines, released last week, shortened the recommended isolation period from 10 days to five for infected people who do not have symptoms, or whose symptoms are resolving. But the agency did not recommend testing before leaving isolation, an omission that surprised and worried many outside experts. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director, told The New York Times last week that the recommendation was based on evidence showing that the vast majority of transmissibility happens in the two days before symptoms and the two to three days after onset. The guidelines suggested that following isolation, recovered people wear a mask around others for another five days. Dr. Walensky defended the decision to omit testing, saying that rapid tests are not reliable for determining when an individual is no longer contagious. The Food and Drug Administration also said last week that rapid tests might be less reliable at picking up Omicron, compared with infections caused by previous variants. But the agency declined to elaborate on the basis for that assertion. Many public health experts said ending isolation at five days was risky, and that the agency should at least urge people to test negative before mingling with others. They also derided the agency for what some saw as a capitulation to pressure from corporations buckling under staff shortages during the Omicron surge. Responding to some of the criticisms, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top coronavirus adviser, said on Sunday that the C.D.C. was considering adding testing to its recommendations, and would clarify the guidance within days. The agency was widely expected to add testing to its guidance as early as Tuesday. But in a surprising move, officials updated the C.D.C. website without a testing requirement. The agency on Tuesday also provided scientific rationale for shortening the isolation period. The guidelines now say that an individual who “has access to a test and wants to test” at the end of the isolation period may do so, but stops short of a recommendation to test. The new guidelines “facilitate individual social and well-being needs, return to work, and maintenance of critical infrastructure,” according to an update posted on Tuesday to the agency’s website. For people exposed to the virus who are unvaccinated or have not yet received a booster dose of one of the vaccines, the agency now recommends a quarantine of five days, followed by strict mask use for another five. People who have received a booster shot do not need to quarantine following an exposure, but should wear a mask for 10 days afterward, according to the guidelines. Women who received Covid vaccinations while pregnant were at no greater risk of delivering their babies prematurely or of giving birth to unusually small babies than pregnant women who did not get vaccinated, a new study reports. The study, one of the first to examine the health of babies born to women vaccinated during pregnancy, was a reassuring signal. Low-birth-weight babies and infants born early are more likely to experience developmental delays and other health problems. An earlier study had found that women vaccinated during pregnancy did not face a higher risk of miscarriage than the unvaccinated. The new study looked at some 46,079 singleton pregnancies that resulted in a live birth, including some 10,064 among women who received one or more doses of Covid vaccine between Dec. 15, 2020, and July 22, 2021, during their pregnancies. Most had received the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, and the vast majority were inoculated during their second or third trimester. Overall, 6.6 percent of the babies were born prematurely, before 37 weeks of pregnancy, and 8.2 percent were born small for their gestational age, weighing less than 5 pounds and 8 ounces. Researchers found no difference in the rates among mothers who had been vaccinated while pregnant and those who had not. “We plan to do follow-up studies on infants and their development, but there hasn’t been enough time to do them yet,” said Dr. Heather S. Lipkind, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at Yale University and lead author on the new research. The study was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in collaboration with Dr. Lipkind, HealthPartners Institute, Kaiser Permanente researchers and the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute.  The risks of pre-term birth, which appear to be higher when pregnant women are infected with the coronavirus, are well established, she said: “With each week of gestation, the brain develops more. If you have Covid and have to deliver preterm, that can also affect long-term development.” Another benefit to vaccination is that women may pass on coronavirus antibodies to their infants, helping to protect them from illness, Dr. Lipkind added. Pregnant women who become infected face a higher risk of developing severe disease, and federal health officials have implored them to get vaccinated. Nevertheless, vaccination rates remain low among pregnant women — about 31 percent as of late September. Vaccination rates also vary widely by community. While almost half of all pregnant Asian Americans are vaccinated, only 25 percent of pregnant Hispanic women are, and only 15 percent of pregnant Black women, according to the C.D.C. “I can tell you, anecdotally, that in my practice women who are not vaccinated are for sure getting way sicker,” Dr. Lipkind said, “and we’re seeing pre-term birth in pregnant women who had Covid and loss of pregnancy. It’s very, very tragic.” She strongly encourages her patients to get vaccinated, especially now that the highly contagious Omicron variant is circulating. But she often faces fierce resistance, she said. “I think people are just afraid of the unknown in general with pregnancy,” Dr. Lipkind said. “This new research should make people feel a little better about vaccination.” The governor of Maryland declared a 30-day state of emergency on Tuesday and mobilized 1,000 members of the National Guard in response to a surge in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. Gov. Larry Hogan wrote on Twitter that the actions were needed “to combat the current COVID-19 surge.” The emergency order also allows the state’s health secretary to “regulate hospital personnel, bed space, and supplies,” Mr. Hogan said on Twitter. In Maryland, 70 percent of residents are fully vaccinated, including 80 percent of people age 12 and older, according to a New York Times database. But officials have been bracing for what they said may be one of the worst waves of the pandemic. The daily average of coronavirus cases has soared by more than 700 percent over the past two weeks, according to The Times’ database. Nationally, the spike has been no less staggering. The United States is averaging more than 547,600 cases daily, a record and a 254 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are rising more slowly, up 43 percent in the past two weeks, and a smaller proportion of patients are landing in intensive care units or requiring mechanical ventilation, compared with those in previous waves. Deaths are down by 3 percent. Despite having one of the highest vaccination rates in the nation, hospitals were filled with unvaccinated patients, Mr. Hogan said Sunday on the CNN program “State of the Union.” “We’re going to take and continue to take every action we possibly can to help our hospitals, our nursing homes and to keep people safe,” he said. It’s unclear how many hospitalizations are patients infected with Omicron versus the Delta variant, which is thought to be significantly more virulent. According to the C.D.C., about 58 percent of cases in Maryland and nearby states are currently Omicron. The Maryland Hospital Association said that the number of hospital patients surpassed the state’s Covid peak from last winter. A lawsuit filed by Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas on Tuesday challenging the Biden administration’s military vaccine mandate revealed that thousands of members of the Texas Army National Guard had refused to receive Covid vaccinations. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern Division of Texas, seeks to prevent unvaccinated National Guard members from being penalized or discharged. It comes as Mr. Abbott has called up thousands of members of the Texas Military Department, which includes the National Guard, to join in border security operations. The filing notes that about 40 percent of the state’s Army National Guard have not been vaccinated “for either religious accommodation needs or otherwise.” No indication of the size of that force is evident on the Texas Army National Guard’s website, but Stars & Stripes, the newspaper of the U.S. armed forces, said that a 2018 Texas Military Department report put the number at about 18,160. Forty percent of that would be more than 7,000 people. The suit indicated that less than 10 percent of the Texas Air National Guard were unvaccinated. It said that “more than 220” members had declined to be vaccinated in a force that the 2018 report put at more than 3,000. Mr. Abbott, who is facing reelection this year, has barred mask and vaccine mandates within Texas and has mounted a strong fight against federal mandates. The state lags the national average in Covid vaccinations, with about 57 percent of the population fully vaccinated, and its Covid hospitalizations have risen 87 percent over the past two weeks as cases have exploded there, according to a New York Times database. The suit was the latest effort by a Republican-led state government to prevent the federal mandate for their National Guards, arguing that it impinges on their command over state troops. In mid-December, the governors of Alaska, Wyoming, Iowa, Mississippi and Nebraska — all Republicans — asked the defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, for exemptions. At the end of December, a federal judge rejected a legal challenge to the federal mandate filed by the governor of Oklahoma, Kevin Stitt, also a Republican. Mr. Austin, who was also named in Mr. Abbott’s suit, has repeatedly affirmed that the mandate applies to the National Guard. On Sunday, after he announced on Twitter that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, he added that the vaccination would “remain a military medical requirement for our workforce,” which he said “remains a readiness issue.” In a letter on Tuesday to Maj. Gen. Tracy R. Norris, the commander of the Texas Military Department, Mr. Abbott described his intent to fight the federal mandate, but also forecast possible defeat. “I cannot guarantee that the judiciary will grant the relief you deserve,” he wrote, adding, “Win or lose, President Biden must be held accountable for his unconscionable willingness to hollow out the Texas National Guard. Please know that I am grateful for your service and will continue fighting on your behalf.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain on Tuesday said that despite the record surge in coronavirus cases, the limited restrictions currently in place in England were the right approach and would be maintained. “We have a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country once again,” Mr. Johnson said at an evening news conference, adding, “We can keep our schools and businesses open, and we can find a way to live with this virus.” The prime minister said he would urge the cabinet to carry on with the current coronavirus contingency measures, called “Plan B,” which were introduced in early December as the Omicron wave took hold. They include masking mandates, guidance to work from home and the use of vaccine passports, but they fall short of the stricter lockdown measures some opposition lawmakers and scientists had called for. “I do think the balance of measures that we have is the right one,” Mr. Johnson said. He said he believed there was a “good chance” of getting through the wave without further restrictions. As Mr. Johnson’s government has pushed for the Britain to remain open in recent weeks, a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant has added to the pressure to shut down. On Tuesday, some 218,000 new coronavirus cases were reported, and hospitalizations have continued to rise. Absences at hospitals across England have left a number of facilities critically short of staff, field hospitals have been set up to deal with an overflow of patients, and public transportation has been hit with shutdowns as workers have called in sick. Mr. Johnson acknowledged that the weeks ahead would be challenging. But he pointed to support being given to key industries and said he believed the staff shortages would be far less disruptive than a lockdown. He said the government had identified 100,000 critical workers who would be offered daily virus tests to help keep essential services open. Schools in England reopened on Tuesday with new measures, including extended masking requirements and testing. Recently retired teachers were being asked to return to cover absences. And as England’s National Health Service moved to a “war footing,” the government was working to identify hospitals most likely to need military support. Despite the rise in cases, there were some glimmers of good news. England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said on Tuesday that new data showed that a booster shot gave a person around 88 percent protection against hospitalization, and that protection was likely to be even greater when it came to mortality. Earlier in the day, Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, said that he was “cautiously optimistic” that coronavirus infection rates in London in the key 18-to-50 age group that has been driving the Omicron outbreak “may possibly have plateaued.” Professor Ferguson told the BBC that it was too early to say whether new infections were going down, but the growth in some areas had slowed. He cautioned, however, that it could be weeks before the full effect of social mixing over Christmas was known. Holiday socializing may prove especially risky for older populations, he said. “Hospitalizations are still generally going up across the country, and we may see high levels for some weeks,” Professor Ferguson said, adding that the numbers were still far below levels seen during a peak last year. WASHINGTON — The United States government doubled its order for Pfizer’s Covid pills on Tuesday, a move that will modestly increase the nation’s very limited supply of the treatment in the short term amid a record-setting surge in coronavirus cases. The new order will eventually provide enough pills for an additional 10 million Americans, bringing the government’s total order of the drug to 20 million treatment courses. But they will not all be available right away. Only 35,000 of the additional courses will be delivered this month, and 50,000 more in February, supplementing 350,000 treatment courses that were already expected over the next two months, according to a senior administration official. The order underscored how urgently health providers need alternatives to vaccines, as roughly 35 million adults remain without a shot and more vulnerable to severe outcomes from Covid. Tens of millions more have been vaccinated but have risk factors that also make them especially vulnerable. The new order also suggests that the federal pandemic response will increasingly rely on oral treatments, which are scarce and facing intense demand. “We may need even more,” President Biden said on Tuesday, announcing the move ahead of a Covid briefing he was set to receive from health advisers. “That’s the estimate we need right now.” The government has agreed to pay Pfizer $530 for each treatment course, the same amount it paid for its initial order late last year, the senior official said. Monthly deliveries of the Pfizer treatment, known as Paxlovid, are not expected to ramp up into the millions until April, too late to help with the current surge. The combined order is not due to be completely filled until the end of September. Still, Mr. Biden described the doubled order as a key component of the federal government’s Covid strategy. “They’re a game-changer,” he said, “and have the potential to dramatically alter” the course of the pandemic. Paxlovid was authorized two weeks ago for use in high-risk Covid patients age 12 or older. Pfizer expects to produce 120 million courses of it in 2022 for all global buyers. The treatment has proved in clinical trials to be highly effective in staving off severe illness when taken soon after the start of symptoms. Pfizer’s treatment is meant to be taken as 30 pills over five days, with patients taking three pills at a time: two of Pfizer’s pills and one of a low-dose H.I.V. drug known as ritonavir, which helps Pfizer’s drug remain active in the body longer. But public health experts have warned that without an adequate testing supply — a problem in many parts of the country — it could be difficult to quickly get the pills to those most in need. A mother in rural Wisconsin said she felt “utterly helpless” as she sent her 13-year-old off to school. Another, in suburban New Jersey, expressed frustration that her highly vaccinated district hadn’t loosened quarantine requirements. One in Chicago said she hoped the city’s teachers followed through on their threat to walk out so her 12-year-old daughter wouldn’t have to return to a crowded classroom. This is parenthood nearly two years into the pandemic, as schools reopen after the holidays. Or don’t. Or do halfway, or open and close again, or — they’re not sure. They’ll let you know tomorrow. The New York Times asked parents to share how they were handling their schools’ approaches. Hundreds responded, almost all of them mothers. Their answers varied widely in specifics but mostly boiled down to: Not well. “I am screaming inside,” wrote Cathy Nieng, the Chicago mother. “I cry a lot,” said Juliana Gamble, whose children — ages 2 and 7 — have been in school and day care in Boston for just 11 days in the past eight weeks. “I feel a total loss of control of my life.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended on Tuesday that Americans who received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine seek a booster shot five months after the second shot, and not wait six months, as earlier guidance had said. The agency also recommended that some immunocompromised children ages 5 to 11 receive an additional primary vaccine shot 28 days after the second shot, matching the guidance for similar people 12 and older. Pfizer’s vaccine is the only one authorized for pediatric use in the United States. The endorsements come on the heels of the authorization of the same steps by the Food and Drug Administration on Monday. The F.D.A. also cleared 12- to 15-year-olds to receive boosters of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The C.D.C.’s vaccine advisory committee is set to meet Wednesday to discuss whether to recommend that step. The C.D.C. and the F.D.A. share responsibility for setting the nation’s vaccine policy, and have worked to present a unified front in their reviews of booster shots. If the advisory committee does follow the F.D.A.’s lead, the C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, is expected to quickly sign off on the recommendation. The moves come at a time when the fast-spreading Omicron variant is infecting record numbers of Americans each day, and many hospitals in the United States are already deluged with Covid-19 patients with the earlier Delta variant. Federal guidance has not changed for when to seek booster shots after initially receiving the Moderna vaccine (6 months after the second shot) or the Johnson & Johnson vaccine (2 months after the single shot). More than 70 percent of people in the United States who are 12 or older have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C. In total, at least 1.9 million adolescents between 12 and 15 have tested positive for the virus, according to the C.D.C. Children who get infected with the coronavirus are less likely to develop serious illness than adults are, but they can still become very sick and even die. The F.D.A. noted that data from Israel showed no serious safety concerns in thousands of 12- to 15-year-olds who received a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine. There were no reports of myocarditis, a very rare side effect linked to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that has been seen mostly in younger men. The condition involves inflammation of muscle tissue in the heart. Macy’s began requesting the vaccination statuses of employees on Tuesday, a sign it was preparing for a potential mandate of vaccinations or weekly testing ahead of a special Supreme Court hearing about such rules on Friday. In a memo sent to employees that was obtained by The New York Times, the retailer — which also owns Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury — told workers in the United States to upload their vaccination statuses to a third-party platform by Jan. 16 “regardless of whether you work in a store, a supply chain facility, an office, or are remote/hybrid.” For employees who say they are unvaccinated, Macy’s said it would “review your submission and you may be contacted by someone from the Colleague Advisory team to discuss next steps.” The company also said it might require proof of negative tests to be uploaded to the same system starting on Feb. 16. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hold the hearing this week to assess the legality of two measures from the Biden administration: a vaccine-or-testing mandate aimed at large employers and a vaccination requirement for certain health care workers. The retail industry had pushed back on a new rule issued in November by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requiring companies with 100 or more workers to mandate vaccines or weekly tests, saying it could intensify a labor shortage that many retailers were dealing with during the busy holiday season. Since then, the Omicron variant has sent global coronavirus cases to record levels, though recent data shows that people infected with it are far less likely to be hospitalized than those infected with the Delta variant, especially if they are vaccinated. Macy’s said separately on Tuesday that it planned to shorten store hours from Monday through Thursday for the rest of January amid the spike and staffing shortages. The news was reported earlier by CNBC. The National Retail Federation, a major industry lobbying group, said in a statement on Tuesday that it “continues to believe that OSHA exceeded its authority in promulgating its vaccine mandate, and we look forward to making that argument before the Supreme Court on Friday.” The group estimated that the order would require 20 million tests a week nationally, based on external data on unvaccinated workers, and that “such testing capacity currently does not exist.” Still, the memo from Macy’s, which has tens of thousands of employees, suggests that the industry is preparing to carry out the rule. Macy’s also said in its memo that it would adopt the new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that recommended shortening isolation periods for infected people to five days from 10 if they are asymptomatic or their symptoms are resolving. The retailer asked in the fall that its corporate staff either be vaccinated or test negative for Covid-19 before returning to the office, but it did not make the same request of store employees. When asked about the memo, a Macy’s representative said in an email that the retailer was “working to comply with federal and local guidelines related to Covid.” Seth Meyers, the host of NBC’s “Late Night,” said Tuesday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus and that tapings of his program would be canceled through the end of the week. In a tweet posted Tuesday morning, Mr. Meyers wrote, “The bad news is, I tested positive for COVID (thanks, 2022!) the good news is, I feel fine (thanks vaccines and booster!)” He indicated that “Late Night” would probably return in a remote format next week, asking viewers to “tune in next Monday to see what cool location we will try and pass off as a studio!!!” Mr. Meyers, a “Saturday Night Live” alumnus, had just returned to “Late Night” on Monday after a holiday break, in a broadcast that featured a live studio audience and guests (including the musician David Byrne and cast members from the NBC drama “This Is Us”) who appeared in remote interviews. “Late Night” is one of several NBC programs produced at the network’s flagship New York headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, along with “S.N.L.” and “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.” Mr. Fallon, the “Tonight Show” host, said that he had tested positive for the virus over the holidays and that he experienced “mild symptoms” while his program was on a scheduled break. He returned to host “Tonight” on Monday. The final “S.N.L.” broadcast of 2021, which was shown on Dec. 18, was also significantly disrupted by the emergence of the Omicron variant. It aired without a live audience or a musical guest, and with most of its regular cast members absent. In his first big test as mayor of New York City, Eric Adams is resisting pressure from municipal unions and elected officials to do more to stop the spread of the coronavirus as cases and hospitalizations are surging. Mr. Adams is holding firm that schools must stay open, and he is urging employers to have employees return to their offices, despite calls from some union leaders to temporarily return to virtual learning and remote work. With coronavirus cases rising rapidly in recent days, a small but growing list of public school districts around the country — including Newark, Atlanta, Milwaukee and Cleveland — have moved temporarily to remote learning. On Monday night, Philadelphia’s school district announced that 81 schools, out of 216, would go remote.  In an interview on CNN on Tuesday morning, Mr. Adams defended his decision to reopen schools, even though roughly a third of parents did not send their children back to classrooms on Monday for the start of the semester. He continued to argue that students were safer at school. “I’m not going to allow the hysteria to prevent the future of my children receiving a quality education,” Mr. Adams said on CNN. On Tuesday, President Biden, citing the lack of evidence that Omicron more severely impacts children, called for schools to remain open in the United States. Local officials should use federal funds from the stimulus package passed last year to improve ventilation systems in schools and support classrooms large enough for social distancing, he said. “We have no reason to think at this point that Omicron is worse for children than previous variants,” Mr. Biden said. “We know that our kids can be safe when in school.” Mr. Adams, a Democrat who was sworn in on Saturday just after the New Year’s Eve ball dropped in Times Square, also urged companies not to allow employees to work remotely, echoing a message he conveyed Monday on Bloomberg TV: “You can’t run New York City from home.” Mr. Adams insisted on Tuesday that he was not at war with the teachers’ union and its president, Michael Mulgrew, who had called for a temporary return to remote learning. “There’s no battle between Michael Mulgrew and Eric Adams,” Mr. Adams said, adding that they speak three times a day and were working together to keep classrooms safe. Mr. Adams has repeatedly argued that city schools must stay open and that poor children in particular suffered from remote learning. He recently announced, alongside his predecessor and the governor, a plan to distribute millions of rapid at-home tests to schools and increase random surveillance testing among students. New York City reported nearly 30,000 new virus cases on Monday, and the number of people hospitalized has surpassed 5,000, according to state data. That level exceeds last winter’s peak, but is still below the hospitalization rate during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, when 12,000 people were hospitalized on the worst days. There are long lines outside testing centers, as has been the case for weeks, and many private companies have said their employees should continue to work from home. Some public officials have called for more aggressive measures to stop the spread of the virus, including Mark D. Levine, the new Manhattan borough president who has become a leading voice in amplifying the views of health experts. Mr. Levine released a 16-point plan on Monday that called on the city to encourage New Yorkers to avoid large gatherings, to temporarily allow city employees to work from home and to require masks at all indoor settings for vaccinated and unvaccinated New Yorkers. “We need to act now to slow this wave, protect our hospitals, and support the sick,” he said. His plan has received support from leaders including Randi Weingarten, the head of the country’s most powerful teachers union, and Ron T. Kim, a state assemblyman from Queens. In September, then-Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered city employees who had been working from home to return to offices. The city has more than 300,000 workers, and about 80,000 of those who work in offices and had been allowed to work remotely were required to return. As coronavirus cases began to soar in December, the largest union representing city workers called on Mr. de Blasio to implement a remote policy for employees who are able to do their jobs from home. On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the union, District Council 37, said it would continue to push Mr. Adams for a remote policy. “Our nonessential members have proven they can do their jobs from home,” the spokeswoman, Freddi Goldstein, said. “There’s no reason to keep them in the office risking their health.” Mr. Adams, who is close with District Council 37 leaders, has said that he would discuss the policy with unions. As New York State all but ran out of its share of a federal pandemic rent relief program in the fall, state officials asked the federal government for $1 billion more — money they said was necessary to keep tens of thousands of struggling residents out of debt and in their homes. But the state has now received some sobering news: it stands to receive about $27 million, less than 3 percent of what it requested. The gap between the need outlined by the state and the money it is getting is yet another stark illustration of just how severe the economic crisis has been in New York and elsewhere. State and federal officials said the need was high in places all around the country and there is only a limited pot of funds overall.  But without more aid, tens of thousands of renters who lost their jobs in the pandemic will not be able to cover their debts and could be at greater risk of eviction when a moratorium expires in less than two weeks. Landlords also will not be able to make up the lost rental income. “If we can’t make up that shortfall, it’s going to mean that many tenants and their landlords are going to continue to struggle with the consequences of the decisions the government made in response to Covid,” said Brian Kavanaugh, a Democrat who sponsored the bill that created New York’s rent relief program and who is chair of the State Senate’s housing committee. The funds are part of a more than $46 billion federal program, set up by Congress through two stimulus bills passed in 2020 and 2021, which is distributing aid across the nation. New York’s share was about $2.4 billion, but by the fall, nearly all of the state’s money was either paid out or spoken for, state officials had said. New York then stopped taking most new applications. There was a chance the state could have still received more. Under the law, places that had not used much of their money could see their funds reallocated to other states with greater need. A county in Texas, for example, voted in November to return some $7 million to the federal government. But in an email sent to the state on Thursday, an official with the Treasury Department said that “the amount of reallocated funds requested” by states like New York and other localities was “far greater than the funding available to distribute.” The Treasury Department did not answer questions about how New York’s share was determined or how much other states may have received. But a spokeswoman for the department said that more money would be redistributed in the future. The amount New York is receiving in additional rent relief was reported by Law 360 on Tuesday based on information included in a court document written by Barbara C. Guinn, the executive deputy commissioner of the office of temporary and disability assistance, the state agency that is administering New York’s rent relief program. That document was filed on Monday in a lawsuit filed by some renters and housing groups over the state’s decision to stop taking applications for rent relief. A spokesman for Gov. Kathy Hochul said the state was “disappointed” in the amount it was slated to receive, but said the state would “continue pursuing all avenues to secure federal funding that keeps New Yorkers in their homes.” The International Polar Foundation confirmed on Tuesday that 11 workers at a research station in Antarctica had tested positive for the coronavirus last month despite testing and quarantine requirements for new arrivals. All of the infected workers — eight of whom are still in Antarctica, and three of whom left on a scheduled Dec. 23 flight — were vaccinated and have recovered, according to the foundation, which is based in Belgium and operates that country’s Princess Elisabeth Station Antarctica research facility. (The facility is named for a member of the Belgian royal family.) The outbreak is not the first among the dozens of research stations scattered around Antarctica; 36 people stationed at a Chilean research base there tested positive in December 2020. But it underscores the ruthlessness with which the virus is spreading, even in the most remote places and among the most vaccinated populations. There are now 30 people stationed at the Princess Elisabeth facility, which is about 2,600 miles south of Cape Town. In addition, four scientists are conducting “remote field work,” according to the foundation. Some news outlets have reported that 16 people tested positive, a number the foundation said was inaccurate. It also pushed back against reports that it had “suspended” flights to and from the station until Jan. 12, saying that no flights had been scheduled between Dec. 23 and Jan. 12 in the first place. “The management at the Princess Elisabeth Antarctica offered anyone who so wished the opportunity to leave on a scheduled flight on Jan. 12,” the foundation said in its statement on Tuesday. “However, all who were on longer missions expressed their wish to stay and continue their work. In addition, a new team of scientists will arrive at the station on Jan. 12 as planned. They were also informed of the outbreak and given the opportunity to cancel, which they refused.” Workers at the station are all vaccinated, but only one has received a booster shot. New arrivals are required to take a P.C.R. test within 72 hours of flying to Cape Town; to quarantine for five days; to take another P.C.R. test within 48 hours of flying from Cape Town to Antarctica; and to take a final test five days after arriving at the Princess Elisabeth Station. According to the foundation, a group arrived in Antarctica on Dec. 9, and all members tested negative on Dec. 14. The first infection was detected on Dec. 15. The foundation said medical staff had “isolated all residents of the station who presented symptoms to such a level that there was a risk of further contamination for others” — leaving it unclear whether asymptomatic workers had been required to isolate, and what criteria were used to determine who posed a risk. An infected person can transmit the virus even if they have no symptoms. JERUSALEM — Fourth shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine produce a fivefold increase in antibodies in recipients’ blood, according to preliminary study results announced on Tuesday by an Israeli hospital. The small, pioneering research study, underway for a week, is meant to test the safety and effectiveness of giving yet another shot of the vaccine to people who have already received a booster dose. Still, there remains debate over whether fourth shots are advisable, as research indicates that Covid vaccines already protect against the worst outcomes, including from the Omicron variant. Any booster is likely to raise the number of antibodies in the short term; the question remains how long the effect will last because antibodies inevitably decline over time. Officials at the hospital — Sheba Medical Center, near Tel Aviv — said the increase in antibodies, which are the body’s frontline defense against infection but are just one of the many parts of the human immune system, could provide protection against infection, with the Omicron variant now surging across much of the world. The study involved administering an additional shot to 150 generally healthy medical workers who had received a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least four months ago, and whose antibody count in blood tests had dropped below levels considered sufficient to protect against infection, according to a spokesman for Sheba. Israel is facing a surge in coronavirus cases, driven by the Omicron variant. In an effort to protect the most vulnerable parts of the population, Israel has already begun offering fourth vaccine doses to people 60 and over, to people with weakened immune systems, and to medical and nursing home workers. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, a strong supporter of fourth shots, visited Sheba Medical Center on Tuesday and was the first to announce the preliminary results of the study. “The fourth vaccine, to a very high degree of probability, works,” he said. Prof. Gili Regev Yochay, the director of the infectious disease epidemiology unit at Sheba and the leader of the study, said it would yield more information in the coming days and weeks. Israel was a leader in introducing the first round of Covid vaccinations and later in giving booster shots, putting it in a position to make early assessments of how effective the shots are and how quickly protection wears off. A panel of medical experts advising the Israeli government recommended last month that the country start offering fourth doses, pointing to evidence of decreased protection against infection in people who were among the first to receive a third dose in August. Israeli data showed that among people 60 and over, the rate of infection from the Delta variant doubled once four or five months had elapsed since they received booster shots. But there was no immediate evidence of decreased effectiveness against serious illness. Health officials took some time to consider the fourth-shot recommendation, saying they were still gathering data about Omicron from abroad. Some experts asked whether the recommendation was premature, given the lack of data. The Ministry of Health acted first to approve fourth doses for people with weakened immune systems, and then for the residents and staff of nursing homes. The ministry expanded eligibility on Sunday to everyone 60 and over, without presenting any new data to back the decision. The decision was based on a rapid rise in infections in Israel and an assessment of the risk of increased serious illness, the ministry said, arguing that there was no time to wait for additional data. But officials were at least convinced that a fourth dose was safe. Sheba officials said on Sunday that side effects experienced by people who received a fourth dose as part of the study were similar to those felt after third doses: mainly mild reactions at the injection site, with a few temporary fevers or headaches. The president of Mozambique and his wife have tested positive for Covid-19 and are in isolation, the government said on Monday. The president, Filipe Nyusi, 62, and his wife, Isaura, 59, took rapid tests and did not have symptoms, according to a statement released by his office. The couple decided to isolate while awaiting results from P.C.R. tests, which were to be completed in a lab, the statement said. Mr. Nyusi is the latest of several heads of state in southern Africa to test positive in recent weeks, among them President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and President Hage Geingob of Namibia. In August, Mr. Nyusi began a mass vaccination drive for adult Mozambicans, and this week, he renewed his call for all adults to get inoculated. Twenty-eight percent of the population has had at least one vaccine dose, according to Our World in Data, a project at the University of Oxford. The Omicron variant has led to a record number of new confirmed cases in the country. On Dec. 31, the authorities received reports of 4,861 new daily cases, the highest number recorded in one day since the start of the pandemic, the Health Ministry said. The previous day, Mr. Nyusi had visited military forces fighting an insurgency in the province of Cabo Delgado, in the north of the country. There, he met President Mokgweetsi Masisi of Botswana and his wife. Officials in Botswana on Monday announced that Mr. Masisi was also isolating at his official residence after testing positive for the coronavirus. The Omicron variant was first identified by scientists in southern Africa in late November. The United States restricted travel to and from Mozambique, South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi and Namibia, drawing criticism from regional leaders and international health officials. The White House lifted the restrictions on Dec. 31. Mozambique has recorded 192,453 confirmed cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic started and 2,031 deaths, according to official data. Novak Djokovic, the world’s No. 1-ranked male tennis player and his sport’s most prominent vaccination skeptic, said on Tuesday that he would play in this month’s Australian Open after receiving a medical exemption. Djokovic, the men’s tournament’s defending champion, revealed his plans in a post on his Instagram account alongside a photograph of himself with luggage on an airport tarmac. “I’m heading Down Under with an exemption permission,” he wrote. “Let’s go 2022.” Tournament officials confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that Djokovic had received a medical exemption after a review of his application by two independent panels, a procedure that strongly suggests he remains unvaccinated. Djokovic’s participation in the Australian Open, the tennis season’s first major, was in doubt as recently as last week, when he reportedly withdrew from an event in Sydney. Djokovic, who has had Covid, has consistently refused to say whether he has been inoculated or intends to be. According to the rules for the Australian Open, all participants must be vaccinated against the coronavirus or apply for and receive a medical exemption from an independent panel of experts. In December, Djokovic’s father, Srdjan Djokovic, raised new questions about his son’s participation, and his vaccination status, when he suggested that Djokovic was unlikely to play in Australia “under these blackmails and conditions.” Those comments came only days before Novak Djokovic was named as a participant in the Australian Open by the tournament’s organizers when they released the entry list for the main draw. “Defending champion Djokovic will play for an incredible 10th Australian Open trophy — and a men’s record 21st major singles title — and will be the favorite in a draw which showcases 49 of the world’s top 50,” the tournament said in a statement announcing the field. But Craig Tiley, the chief executive of Tennis Australia, which hosts the tournament, quickly moved to clarify that Djokovic’s inclusion in the entry list was not a confirmation that he had agreed to be vaccinated, or that he would be allowed to enter Australia, which has some of the world’s most strict coronavirus protocols for foreigners. “As a matter of course, everyone goes on the entry list,” Tiley said in a local television interview at the time. “It’s not a commitment list about who’s exactly in the draw. That comes in several weeks’ time, when the actual list, and draw, gets finalized for the Australian Open.” The Open’s draw will be held Jan. 10. The tournament begins on Jan. 17. The police in Spain are investigating major cases of theft or the illegal trafficking of Covid test kits amid a serious shortage of the tests. The national police released a video showing their seizure of 300,000 unauthorized antigen tests from a warehouse on Dec. 29 in the municipality of Fuenlabrada on the outskirts of Madrid, the capital.And near Barcelona, 208,000 antigen tests were stolen from a warehouse on New Year’s Eve. The criminal activity comes at a time when the shortage of test kits has prompted panic buying and long lines outside pharmacies and health care centers. Before Christmas, Spain’s health minister, Carolina Darias, warned that the shortage of tests had become a “maximum worry” amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. She said the spread of the variant had increased demand for tests by more than 1,000 percent in two weeks. On Monday, Spain reported about 35,000 new daily cases. The 14-day average case rate has climbed to almost 2,300 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In other news from around the world:  The economic recovery in New York will continue to lag that of the United States for years, with the city not expected to rebuild its labor force to prepandemic levels until late 2025, a year later than initially projected, according to a new economic forecast by the city’s Independent Budget Office. The report lays out a challenging road to recovery for New York, whose economy is underpinned by service industries closely tied to travel and tourism that collapsed at the start of the pandemic in spring 2020 and have been slow to recover. Parts of the city’s economy have thrived during the pandemic — Wall Street firms and lately, residential sales — but the course of the coronavirus will largely dictate how and when New York rebounds, the city agency said. The broader national economy has regained nearly all the jobs lost during the pandemic, but New York has regained only about 35 percent of its lost jobs in 2020, the report said. The prognosis also raises major questions about the impact of hybrid work on the value of office buildings, which pay a significant share of the city’s property taxes, and the future of brick-and-mortar retail, which was struggling even before the pandemic accelerated the move to online shopping. “The increasingly unpredictable nature of the spread of Covid-19 variants continues to confound economic forecasts and will remain one of — if not the primary — risk to the stability of the city’s financial plan,” the report said. The city government has avoided drastic cuts or tax increases because of $22 billion in federal aid for schools and city departments. The Independent Budget Office warned that the assistance has masked the true economic challenges confronting the city. The city’s economy is expected to grow 4.4 percent in 2022, fueled by a demand for workers, but slow considerably in the following years, the agency said. The city could have 4.694 million workers at the end of 2025, a slight increase from the 4.679 million workers at the end of 2019. But one key industry will take longer to recover: leisure and hospitality. By late 2025, the sector is projected to have 100,000 fewer employees than in late 2019 as tourism is slow to rebound and business travel is reduced significantly. A major source of income from tourism, the hotel occupancy tax, could reach $577 million in 2025, up from $85 million in 2021 but still below 2019 levels, the agency said. “With so many New York City residents’ employment and well-being directly tied to the tourism industry, even modest declines in tourism could have major impacts on the city’s economy,” the report said."
94,The New York Times,nytimes,"After a snowstorm in Virginia stranded hundreds of drivers on Interstate 95, safety experts have offered advice on how people can stay safe if they are stuck in their vehicles.",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3sZ8vAE%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0JDHX9U5w-pGcMniik6BUOYUZyUwd0_r69kJTOSRj2pOKRqhQ43RScdZg&h=AT0ruAaAPoq8Nb0gvS1ck-va1u4FgFgEt7cUZ4VlUuZPKlvSVhhDssSp-dWsra1s182iR1F_emtMZwV3o8nfp1xCsitLpbm1sHV2948yA6zAKEawbRR9z2FNRxgkRVnQ5EOABjwL_ubt5c-Nnywi&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT23RxLQAHK3870MBYopH9AZKiTxDG8GyMIAPdXVDN_wkBBPC6o2Va6O-5Z1P3o-FUItJlEQXpgFuwn_vS4GAaCAiCeBIvBLeBAHxJn1itmqnOdaYYby2D6R4K19HIRNttwiQj5XoNrQhPGVqygZAE_DJ_-Vu_K1ezdOcNdS8s9CqntF,1d,"In October, Nadia Popovici, a Seattle Kraken hockey fan, went to a game with her parents. She spotted a strange-looking mole on the neck of an assistant equipment manager for the opposing team, the Vancouver Canucks, and typed out a message to him on her phone. “The mole on the back of your neck is possibly cancerous. Please go see a doctor!” the message read, with the words “mole,” “cancer” and “doctor” colored bright red. Her message may have saved his life. It turned out to be a melanoma, a particularly deadly type of skin cancer that, because it was detected early, could be removed before it had spread. “She took me out of a slow fire,” the assistant manager, Brian Hamilton, said at a recent news conference. Skin cancer is common, but often survivable. Basal and squamous cell carcinomas, by far the most common types of skin cancer, can be extraordinarily disfiguring but are rarely fatal. Melanoma is a different story. It accounts for just about 1 percent of all diagnosed skin cancers, but causes the vast majority of deaths. In 2021, the American Cancer Society estimated that doctors would diagnose about 106,110 new melanomas in the United States, and that about 7,180 people would die of the disease. The risk increases with age. Early detection can lead to effective treatment. The five-year survival rate for “thin melanoma,” Stage 1, when the cancer is less than one millimeter thick, is 99 percent, according to the American Cancer Society. Once it has spread to distant organs, Stage 4, the survival drops to 27 percent. “If you miss the beginnings of this one, you might actually miss the opportunity to save the person’s life,” said Dr. Allan C. Halpern, the chief of dermatology service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. So in light of the hockey “miracle” — and the new year — consider this your guide to setting some healthy skin care habits for 2022. If you see something on your skin that is new, changing, not healing or doesn’t seem right, get it checked out by a doctor as soon as possible. “What we often refer to is the ‘ugly duckling sign,’” Dr. Halpern, a vice president of the Skin Cancer Foundation, said. “If it just looks different than everything else, get it checked out.”  The Skin Cancer Foundation, founded in 1979, has long recommended an “ABCDE” test for worrisome lesions. It is a mnemonic device to check what to look for: A for asymmetry, when one half doesn’t match the other; B for an irregular border; C for colors that might be different from one another; D for a large diameter, or anything approaching the size of a Cheerio or a pencil eraser; and E for evolving, meaning that it changes over time. Those recommendations are still useful, but they may be somewhat limiting.  “Many melanomas and most nonmelanoma skin cancers don’t fall under the ABCDE pattern,” the foundation reported in its journal in 2019. “When we educate people about the warning signs of skin cancer, we often hear from them, ‘Mine didn’t look like that.’” Many dermatologists recommend people look for things that feel out of the ordinary. Is it new? Is it growing? Is it refusing to heal? Those may all be indications that it’s time to see a doctor. Dr. Halpern said to look for any unusual lesions that make you anxious. “People have a sense of normal,” he said. “It’s really important not to downplay people’s visceral knowledge of normal versus out of the ordinary.” You won’t know what’s weird if you don’t carve out time to look. The Cleveland Clinic recommends a monthly scan, though some doctors say you can opt for a quarterly skin check instead. “If you don’t examine yourself at least once a month, you don’t have a good mental memory of what you look like, so you won’t be able to spot change,” Dr. Halpern said. To scan, stand in front of a full-length mirror; have a hand mirror on deck for hard-to-reach places. Start systematically, from the top of your head down. Don’t forget your scalp and neck, or under the nails. The Skin Cancer Foundation has a guide, and the American Academy of Dermatology Association has a video tutorial. And remember, look for weird. If there’s a mole that you think looks out of the ordinary, get it checked out. You can also take pictures of your moles so you can compare them on your next scan. If you’re noticing changes, or if you develop a sore that does not heal, call a dermatologist. A recent study found that married people are more likely than the unmarried to get timely diagnosis and treatment for malignant skin cancer. That may be because they have someone else who sees them almost every day, and who might notice something unusual. Spouses may also urge their partner to visit a doctor. “The number of times that I’ll see someone at the office who comes in and either they, or their significant other, has said: ‘That’s not just like it was on you before. I can’t say why it is, but it’s just different,’” said Dr. Aaron Mangold, the divisional chair of clinical dermatology at the Mayo Clinic. If you live alone, a buddy system might work. Consider setting up a monthly reminder with a roommate or a regular “mole check” evening with a close friend. Your skin, and your personal history, affect how often you have to check. If you’re at high risk of skin cancer, you should have a different relationship to your dermatologist and your moles. People who have a family history of melanoma are more likely to develop the disease. “If you’ve gotten a lot of blistering sunburns, maybe five by the time you’re 18,” or used a tanning bed, you are at increased risk, Dr. Deborah S. Sarnoff, the president of the Skin Cancer Foundation, said. “That really bumps it up, the way smoking bumps up lung cancer.” Your skin color plays a role, too. People with light skin, blond or red hair, blue eyes, or many freckles and moles are more prone to developing skin cancer than people of color — it’s more than 20 percent more common in white people than Black people, according to the American Cancer Society. That’s because most skin cancers are sun related, and darker skin is less at risk for sun-induced cancers. In people of all races, however, skin cancers can also present in places that do not regularly get sun exposure, like the hands or soles of their feet, the mucous membranes (gums, lips) and the nail beds. These cancers may be more deadly, because they are often diagnosed at a later stage.  And although melanoma is more common when you’re older, young people can get skin cancer, too. In fact, it is one of the most common cancers in people younger than 30, especially young women. The Cleveland Clinic says you should “always be suspicious of a new mole that develops after the age of 30.” Many are harmless, but it’s good to check with a dermatologist, just to be safe. Come to the doctor’s appointment prepared to point out any unusual spots you’ve noticed, and to have your entire body checked. “It is every square centimeter of skin,” said Dr. Ashwani Rajput, the director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center for the Washington, D.C., region, who treats patients with melanoma. The Skin Cancer Foundation recommends you remove makeup before your exam, if you wear any, so it will be easier to spot suspicious moles. “Leave any embarrassment at the door,” Dr. Sarnoff said, adding, “You’re there to have your skin looked at.” A screening can take up to 30 minutes. A doctor who finds a mole that might be cancerous will often numb the area and then remove some or all of it for a biopsy. The doctor will share the results and discuss next steps with you if the biopsy returns a positive cancer result. “The overwhelming majority of these visits do end up being covered by insurance,” Dr. Halpern said, especially if you are at high risk or there is cause for concern."
95,The New York Times,nytimes,"Public school officials in Chicago canceled classes for Wednesday amid a clash with the teachers' union, whose members had threatened to stay home in a bid to force instruction online during a coronavirus surge.",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3qQJrJb%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1eeMHFxDAoG-e1Q1D2R4VKsV9gfX8cBshxQE1vQ6W_a_wD0rWVkcrGS90&h=AT39BN6ZCV3Jv9LumwuduPRqDDDUsl7S0_Z_tABJmlltwlU5t1DXWYXCQNHDTAbJo5AagKnOOX2aHPGTKBDK_3efklQlh7lYL2dB56RlwlYeSXt2yBb8Yy8RYfMbpVVTcXtwwqpGSdOAXoprLi10&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT3xpkCti9g2l5TjECkL7pyqMmoqcJHH2Pu0jvX-aHi85gqJ7P9DXC0ZE3GWd60iL89bL6yHu2XcosqsicwqPRlcxfvrqEUFpGW-RWUwE65flJ_5fm4r3p2L-pYrq4tyRGd43avAOzQPlcKVzUggjvQ1kICwheWJnvTjwAWqY5Et9jYo,1d,"En noviembre de 2020, tras un año de tratamientos de fertilidad, Yael Geller se emocionó al enterarse de que estaba embarazada. Luego de un ultrasonido normal, tuvo la confianza suficiente para decirle a su hijo de 3 años que su “hermano o hermana” estaba creciendo en su vientre. Sin embargo, unas pocas semanas después, cuando llevaba a su hijo de la casa a la escuela, recibió una llamada del consultorio de su médico. Un análisis de sangre prenatal indicaba que a su feto podría faltarle parte de un cromosoma, lo cual podría acarrear padecimientos y trastornos mentales graves. Esa noche, sentada en el sofá con su esposo, Geller lloró al explicarle que quizá tendrían que enfrentar la decisión de interrumpir el embarazo. Él se sentó en silencio, a procesar la noticia. “¿Cómo me puede estar pasando esto?”, se preguntaba Geller, de 32 años. Al día siguiente, los médicos usaron una aguja larga y dolorosa para tomar un pequeño pedazo de su placenta. Le hicieron análisis y se comprobó que el resultado inicial era erróneo. Ahora, su hijo Emmanuel ya tiene 6 meses y no muestra ningún síntoma del padecimiento que se le había detectado antes de nacer. Geller creyó en la maravillosa promesa que la tecnología de Silicon Valley le hizo a las futuras madres: que unas cuantas ampolletas de su sangre, tomadas en el primer trimestre, pueden lograr que las empresas detecten problemas graves de desarrollo en el ADN del feto con una precisión impresionante. En poco más de una década, las pruebas han pasado de ser experimentos de laboratorio a conformar una industria que atiende a más de una tercera parte de las mujeres embarazadas en Estados Unidos, y atrae al negocio a compañías de alto perfil como Labcorp y Quest Diagnostics, así como a muchas empresas emergentes. En un inicio, las pruebas se usaron para detectar el síndrome de Down y funcionaron muy bien. Pero conforme los fabricantes intentaron superar las ventas de los demás, empezaron a ofrecer análisis adicionales para detectar padecimientos cada vez más raros. Las predicciones funestas que hacen estas nuevas pruebas suelen estar equivocadas, según reveló una investigación de The New York Times. Eso incluye la prueba positiva de Geller, que detecta el síndrome de Prader-Willi, un trastorno que ofrece pocas probabilidades de llevar una vida independiente en la edad adulta. Hay estudios que revelan que los resultados positivos de esta prueba son incorrectos en más del 90 por ciento de los casos. Sin embargo, en sus catálogos de productos y los documentos de resultados, las empresas describen las pruebas como algo casi definitivo. Presentan sus hallazgos como “confiables” y “de alta precisión”, y afirman que ofrecen “total certeza” y “tranquilidad” para los padres que quieren tener toda la información posible. Algunas empresas ofrecen pruebas sin publicar ningún dato sobre su precisión, o señalan las cifras de sus mejores análisis y excluyen los menos favorables. Otras basan sus aseveraciones en estudios en los que solo uno o dos embarazos padecían el trastorno en cuestión. Esta no es la primera vez que la tecnología de Silicon Valley intenta construir un negocio centrado en los exámenes de sangre. Años antes de que abriera la primera empresa de pruebas prenatales, Theranos, una compañía emergente, afirmó que podía realizar más de mil pruebas con una pequeña muestra de sangre, antes de colapsar en medio de acusaciones de fraude. En contraste con el caso de Theranos, la ciencia en la que se basan estas empresas para analizar la sangre en busca de padecimientos comunes no está en duda. Los expertos afirman que ha revolucionado la detección del síndrome de Down, y ha reducido de manera significativa la necesidad de realizar pruebas más riesgosas. No obstante, la misma tecnología —conocida como prueba prenatal no invasiva (NIPT, por su sigla en inglés)— genera resultados menos precisos cuando intenta detectar padecimientos menos comunes. La mayoría de estos síndromes se deriva de pequeños fragmentos faltantes de cromosomas que se conocen como microdeleciones. Otros son causados por copias faltantes o excesivas de cromosomas completos. Pueden manifestarse en una amplia gama de síntomas como discapacidad intelectual, defectos del corazón, una expectativa de vida reducida o una tasa de mortalidad infantil elevada. No todos los pacientes se someten a pruebas para detectar todas las afecciones; los médicos deciden qué pedir, y la mayoría de las empresas venden pruebas de microdeleción como un complemento opcional para la detección de Down. La mayoría de los fabricantes no dicen con qué frecuencia se realizan sus pruebas de microdeleción. Pero queda claro que algunas de las pruebas se utilizan de manera generalizada. Un importante fabricante de pruebas, Natera, declaró que en 2020 realizó más de 400.000 análisis por una sola microdeleción, lo que equivale a decir que aproximadamente el 10 por ciento de las mujeres embarazadas en Estados Unidos usaron sus pruebas. Para evaluar las pruebas más nuevas, el Times entrevistó a investigadores y luego combinó los datos de múltiples estudios para producir los mejores cálculos disponibles sobre la precisión de los resultados de las pruebas de detección de microdeleciones más comunes. El análisis mostró que los resultados positivos son incorrectos en alrededor del 85 por ciento de los casos. Los expertos afirman que no hay un umbral único para la frecuencia con la que una prueba debe producir resultados positivos correctos para que valga la pena ofrecerla al público. Señalan que, cuando las pruebas sí identifican una anomalía con precisión, les pueden dar tiempo a los futuros padres para informarse y prepararse para los retos que les esperan. Algunos dijeron que una prueba de microdeleción común para una condición llamada el síndrome de DiGeorge tiene el mayor potencial de precisión. Pero hay cientos de síndromes de microdeleción, y las pruebas más amplias buscan entre cinco y siete, lo que significa que las mujeres no deben tomar un resultado negativo como prueba de que su bebé no tiene un trastorno genético. Para las pacientes que están especialmente preocupadas, los obstetras recomiendan otros tipos de exámenes que conllevan un pequeño riesgo de aborto espontáneo, pero son más fiables. Algunos dijeron que los análisis de sangre que buscan las condiciones más raras son buenos para poco más que reforzar los resultados de las empresas de análisis. “Es un poco como realizar mamografías en niños”, dijo Mary Norton, obstetra y genetista de la Universidad de California en San Francisco. “La posibilidad de cáncer de mama es muy baja, entonces, ¿por qué lo estamos haciendo? Creo que es una cuestión de mercadeo”. Hay ciertas restricciones para lo que pueden ofrecer los fabricantes de pruebas. La Administración de Medicamentos y Alimentos de Estados Unidos (FDA, por su sigla en inglés) suele solicitar evaluaciones sobre la frecuencia con la que otras pruebas médicas relevantes generan resultados correctos y si las fallas se les explican con claridad a los pacientes y a los médicos. Pero la FDA no regula este tipo de pruebas. Alberto Gutierrez, exdirector de la oficina de la FDA que supervisa muchas pruebas médicas, revisó los materiales de publicidad de tres empresas que fabrican pruebas y los describió como “problemáticos”. “Creo que la información que ofrecen es engañosa”, dijo. Se supone que las pacientes que reciben un resultado positivo deben realizar pruebas de seguimiento, que a menudo requieren una extracción de líquido amniótico o una muestra de tejido placentario. Esas pruebas pueden costar miles de dólares, conllevan un pequeño riesgo de aborto espontáneo y no se pueden realizar hasta más tarde en el embarazo, en algunos estados, más allá del punto en que los abortos son legales. Desde hace años, las empresas saben que las pacientes no siempre se realizan las pruebas de seguimiento. Un estudio de 2014 reveló que el 6 por ciento de las pacientes que resultaron positivas se practicaron un aborto sin hacerse otra prueba para confirmar el resultado. Ese mismo año, The Boston Globe citó a un médico que describía tres abortos después de resultados positivos no confirmados. Tres genetistas relataron ejemplos más recientes en entrevistas con el Times. Uno describió un caso en el que las pruebas de seguimiento revelaron que el feto estaba sano. Pero cuando llegaron los resultados, la paciente ya había decidido terminar su embarazo. Luego de que se les facilitaron secciones del reportaje del Times, media docena de las empresas más grandes de pruebas prenatales se rehusaron a dar entrevistas. Emitieron comunicados por escrito que afirmaban que las pacientes siempre debían revisar los resultados con un médico y advertían que las pruebas no están diseñadas para diagnosticar un padecimiento, sino para identificar a pacientes de alto riesgo que deben realizarse análisis adicionales. En diversas entrevistas, 14 pacientes que obtuvieron falsos positivos relataron que la experiencia fue agonizante. Recuerdan que investigaron frenéticamente esas enfermedades de las que nunca habían oído hablar, pasaron noches de insomnio y muchos días en los que escondían sus embarazos. Ocho dijeron que nunca recibieron información sobre la posibilidad de un falso positivo, y cinco recuerdan que sus médicos trataron los resultados de las pruebas como definitivos. Cuando el embarazo de Meredith Bannon dio positivo para el síndrome de DiGeorge, una enfermera la llamó y le dijo que ella y su esposo pronto tendrían que enfrentar “decisiones difíciles” relacionadas con la “calidad de vida” de su hijo, lo que Bannon interpretó como una decisión sobre si terminar el embarazo. Bannon recibió la llamada mientras manejaba hacia la casa de sus padres. Su hijo estaba en el asiento trasero y estaba usando una camiseta que decía “hermano mayor”. “Iba a decirles que estaba embarazada pero, en vez de eso, tuve que decirles que obtuve ese resultado horrible”, recuerda Bannon. Más pruebas revelaron que el resultado era incorrecto. Su bebé nacerá en abril. Algunas mujeres empezaron a planear abortos tentativos tras recibir las detecciones positivas. “No pude evitar pensar en interrumpir mi embarazo”, dijo Allison Mihalich, de 33 años, cuyo análisis indicó, de manera incorrecta, que su bebé podría tener síndrome de Turner, una condición que puede causar infertilidad y defectos del corazón. (Ciertos estudios muestran que los resultados positivos de esta prueba son incorrectos en el 74 por ciento de los casos). En ese momento, ella vivía en Indiana y recuerda que tuvo que apresurarse para someterse a las pruebas de seguimiento porque las leyes estatales prohíben el aborto a las 22 semanas de gestación. Entre 2011 y 2013, Sequenom, una pequeña empresa de biotecnología, triplicó su tamaño. La clave de su éxito fue MaterniT21, una prueba de detección prenatal que identificaba el síndrome de Down con increíble precisión. Las pruebas de detección tradicionales tardaban meses en generar resultados y solían requerir varios análisis de sangre. Esta nueva prueba producía menos falsos positivos con una sola muestra de sangre. La prueba también podía determinar el sexo del feto, por lo que rápidamente se convirtió en un éxito. “La gente entraba y me decía: ‘Quiero hacerme esta prueba que determina el sexo’”, recuerda Anjali Kaimal, especialista en medicina materno-fetal del Hospital General de Massachusetts. La competencia empezó a lanzar sus propias pruebas. En la actualidad, los analistas estiman que el tamaño del mercado oscila entre 600 millones y miles de millones de dólares, y se espera que el número de mujeres que se someten a estas pruebas se duplique para el año 2025. A medida que las empresas comenzaron a buscar maneras de diferenciar sus productos, muchas decidieron tratar de detectar más trastornos menos comunes. Todas las detecciones pueden realizarse con la misma muestra de sangre, por lo que los médicos ordenan muchas más pruebas durante las consultas de atención prenatal. Sin embargo, para las empresas de pruebas, la adición de las microdeleciones puede duplicar el monto que paga una aseguradora: desde un promedio de 695 dólares por pruebas básicas hasta 1349 dólares para el conjunto ampliado, según la empresa de datos sanitarios Concert Genetics. (Las pacientes cuyo seguro no cubrió completamente las pruebas describen que les cobraron cifras tremendamente diferentes, que van desde unos pocos cientos hasta miles de dólares). No obstante, estos padecimientos eran tan poco comunes que las pruebas los identificaban en menos ocasiones. Por ejemplo, Natera realizó 400.000 pruebas en 2020 para el síndrome de DiGeorge, un trastorno asociado con defectos cardíacos y discapacidad intelectual. Natera declinó una solicitud de entrevista después de que el Times le presentó su informe. En un comunicado, la empresa dijo que la detección temprana del síndrome de DiGeorge puede “mejorar profundamente” los resultados de las pacientes y destacó la poca frecuencia que identifica algunas de las otras condiciones. (Dijo que la prueba que dio un falso positivo para el síndrome de Prader-Willi en el embarazo de Geller, por ejemplo, había arrojado resultados positivos solo 113 veces desde 2015). Además, señaló un estudio reciente de 20.000 mujeres embarazadas que encontró que DiGeorge ocurre en 1 de cada 1600 nacimientos, lo que es dos veces más común que otras estimaciones. La empresa ofrece asesoramiento genético gratuito a las pacientes que dan positivo en la prueba. Natera también publica datos sobre la frecuencia con la que sus resultados positivos son correctos e incluye esa información en las hojas de resultados de los pacientes. Otras empresas publican poca información sobre la cantidad de pruebas que venden y mucha menos investigación sobre cuán bien funcionan sus exámenes de detección. La prueba prenatal de Myriad Genetics, Prequel, ofrece cinco exámenes de microdeleciones, aunque su estudio sobre la prueba solo incluye dos casos confirmados de microdeleciones. En un comunicado, Myriad estimó que solo uno de cada 9000 de sus pacientes da positivo en una microdeleción. Dijo que sus datos mostraban que una “fracción muy pequeña” de esos exámenes eran erróneos, pero se negó a proporcionar cifras específicas. Algunas empresas buscan padecimientos tan raros que hay pocos ejemplos conocidos que sirvan de comparación. Tanto Labcorp, que adquirió Sequenom, como Myriad Genetics ofrecen análisis de un trastorno tan poco común que su prevalencia es desconocida, y otro, llamado síndrome de Jacobsen, solo afecta 1 de cada 100.000 nacimientos. Diana Bianchi dirige un laboratorio de los Institutos Nacionales de Salud que estudia los análisis de sangre prenatales. Y, sobre el síndrome de Jacobsen, afirma: “Nunca he visto un caso de eso en mis más de 20 años de trabajo en genética”. Esas deficiencias rara vez se mencionan cuando las empresas les explican sus pruebas a médicos y pacientes. Un informe de laboratorio de Labcorp MaterniT21 les dice a los pacientes que la prueba “detectó” un problema, aunque la mayoría de los estudios que muestran resultados positivos en ese examen suelen ser incorrectos. Myriad Genetics promete “confianza total en cada resultado” en su sitio web de pruebas prenatales, pero no dijo nada sobre la frecuencia con la que pueden ocurrir falsos positivos. Después de que el Times preguntó sobre estas pruebas, Myriad eliminó esas afirmaciones. El Times revisó 17 catálogos para pacientes y médicos de ocho empresas de pruebas, entre ellas Natera, Labcorp, Quest y rivales más pequeños. Diez de los catálogos nunca mencionan que un falso positivo puede suceder. Solo uno mencionaba la frecuencia con la que cada prueba produce resultados positivos incorrectos. Los asesores genéticos que han analizado los falsos positivos dicen que es posible que algunos médicos no comprendan cuán mal funcionan las pruebas. Y advierten que, aunque el personal sanitario interprete correctamente la información, es posible que los pacientes se sientan inclinados a creer en los resultados que suenan confiables. Cuando Cloey Canida, de 25 años, obtuvo un resultado positivo en la prueba Harmony de Roche en septiembre, la hoja de resultados parecía clara: decía que su hija tenía una probabilidad “superior a 99/100” de nacer con el síndrome de Patau, una condición que hace que los bebés no sobrevivan más de una semana. Su obstetra trató de tranquilizarla, citando datos independientes que muestran que para una mujer de su edad, el 93 por ciento de los resultados positivos son incorrectos. Pero Canida no podía dejar de pensar en los resultados. Recuerda que lloró durante una ecografía, pensando que era una de las pocas veces que vería cómo se movía su hija. Después de gastar 1200 dólares en pruebas de seguimiento, logró determinar que su embarazo es saludable y su hija no nacerá con el síndrome de Patau. Ahora está en su tercer trimestre. “Ojalá nos hubieran dicho de la tasa de falsos positivos antes de que aceptara la prueba”, dijo. “No me dieron ninguna información sobre eso”. Roche, quien recientemente vendió la prueba Harmony a otra empresa, dijo en un comunicado que “todas las mujeres deben discutir sus resultados con su proveedor de atención médica”, antes de tomar decisiones basadas en los resultados de las pruebas de detección. Por solicitud del Times, tres expertos revisaron los materiales de mercadeo y las hojas de resultados e identificaron las razones por las que una paciente podría confundirse. “Estos números no tienen sentido”, dijo Gutierrez, el exfuncionario de la FDA, después de revisar un anuncio de Quest Diagnostics QNatal Advanced Test. La publicidad afirma que la prueba obtiene resultados positivos de microdeleción en el 75 por ciento de las veces. Pero esa cifra proviene de un solo estudio que incluyó nueve casos confirmados de microdeleciones, para una prueba que detecta siete de esos trastornos. La empresa no especifica cómo se realizan las pruebas individualmente y se negó a proporcionar esos datos. (En un comunicado, Quest dijo que su prueba tiene un “desempeño excelente”). La FDA consideró regular estas pruebas hace una década, pero no lo hizo. Si la agencia las supervisara, exigiría que Quest publique un folleto pero “no sería así”, dijo Gutierrez. No obstante, las empresas siguen avanzando y ven las microdeleciones como una importante oportunidad comercial, especialmente si pueden persuadir a más médicos para que las ordenen y a más aseguradoras para que las cubran. Myriad Genetics, propietaria de la prueba Prequel, ha dicho a sus inversores que planea iniciar una detección de microdeleciones de “próxima generación” en 2022 y que presionará para que los obstetras comiencen a recomendar la prueba. Natera ha realizado más de dos millones de exámenes para el síndrome de Down desde 2013. Salió a bolsa en 2015 y el valor de sus acciones aumentó a 8800 millones de dólares. Con su panel ampliado de exámenes, la empresa prevé un mayor crecimiento en el futuro. “Este es un momento realmente significativo para el negocio de las microdeleciones”, dijo el director ejecutivo de la empresa, Steve Chapman, en una conferencia de inversores en enero pasado. En 2020, los ingresos de la compañía fueron de 391 millones de dólares y proyecta que sus ingresos en 2021 superarán los 615 millones. Pero, según Chapman, si más aseguradoras comienzan a pagar por las pruebas de microdeleción, el potencial es “enorme” porque podrían generar 300 millones más cada año."

The Dixie Fire burned more than 963,000 acres in the Northern California areas of Butte, Plumas, Lassen, Shasta and Tehama Counties in July, destroying 1,329 buildings and damaging 95 others. The cause, investigators determined, was a tree that came into contact with PG&E’s power lines near the Cresta Dam about 100 miles north of Sacramento. Investigators at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, referred their findings to the Butte County district attorney, who previously brought charges against PG&E for the 2018 Camp Fire, which killed scores of people and destroyed the town of Paradise. In that case, PG&E pleaded guilty to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter and one felony count of illegally setting a fire. The utility also agreed to pay $3.5 million in fines as part of the criminal plea. In a statement in response to Cal Fire’s determination, PG&E said the tree that fell struck equipment that was functioning properly. “This tree was one of more than eight million trees within strike distance to PG&E lines,” the utility said. “Regardless of today’s finding, we will continue to be tenacious in our efforts to stop fire ignitions from our equipment and to ensure that everyone and everything is always safe.” PG&E also has charges pending in Shasta County, where the district attorney has charged the utility with manslaughter, along with other felonies and misdemeanors in connection with the Zogg Fire, which burned more than 56,000 acres and destroyed 204 buildings near Redding. Since 2017, PG&E has been the focus of the state’s extreme wildfires that have been made worse by climate change. The company has taken numerous steps to prevent wildfires, including installing weather stations and cameras. The utility has also resorted to the extreme measure of cutting off power, sometimes to millions of people for days. After PG&E amassed $30 billion in liability from the wildfires caused by its equipment, the utility sought bankruptcy protection in January 2019. The company exited bankruptcy in July 2020, promising to work to prevent further wildfires. Victims of the fires have continued to seek compensation for their losses that became part of the company’s bankruptcy plan. The Dixie Fire — among at least three fires that PG&E’s equipment was suspected of causing last year — underscored the lingering threat of wildfires caused by utility equipment."
97,The New York Times,nytimes,"“The ranks of the unemployed technology workers are swelling, as China’s once vibrant internet industry is hit by a harsh and capricious regulatory crackdown,” our columnist Li Yuan writes. “Fear and gloom now rule.”",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3Hy2f6Q%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1HXWWZl3pGkHaU_bsyK_QLm6ORcuoz688rKbWTdltk8d_mjvrQGphaSaU&h=AT36SrkaFJ1SLyD4w1W6rkZ7esd4KMcU-prjOhXM-UmPBMsEmCPEwlSLuAir6W9gbNtUGt-qwBl0Z2Vy8vtsBc1ysaB9DnYZZqtNd0_fbIcvDvYTXhq1zKjb7Nzqix_09UyvUgcCqwoh41n79VTK&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT2YIJe9UPqAfntklXo06y6c4pvwK57bSf2M6ZiR-wgJdk32rqz8EAJjIGGZcpj0j12QO2j2YMs6rc8Khs1zLIq5cfJVWajH676lFbXGkIMR0hj2VKcCSeXvm9CjiGWNOTkBvjLdB5Gyco42n8Pft18Hlbz576npoX4Es0UiuUF5-Vdr,1d,"Weeks before the 2020 presidential election, the conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck outlined his prediction for how Election Day would unfold: President Donald J. Trump would be winning that night, but his lead would erode as dubious mail-in ballots arrived, giving Joseph R. Biden Jr. an unlikely edge. “No one will believe the outcome because they’ve changed the way we’re electing a president this time,” he said. None of the predictions of widespread voter fraud came true. But podcasters frequently advanced the false belief that the election was illegitimate, first as a trickle before the election and then as a tsunami in the weeks leading up to the violent attack at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, according to new research. Researchers at the Brookings Institution reviewed transcripts of nearly 1,500 episodes from 20 of the most popular political podcasts. Among episodes released between the election and the Jan. 6 riot, about half contained election misinformation, according to the analysis. In some weeks, 60 percent of episodes mentioned the election fraud conspiracy theories tracked by Brookings. Those included false claims that software glitches interfered with the count, that fake ballots were used, and that voting machines run by Dominion Voting Systems were rigged to help Democrats. Those kinds of theories gained currency in Republican circles and would later be leveraged to justify additional election audits across the country. The new research underscores the extent to which podcasts have spread misinformation using platforms operated by Apple, Google, Spotify and others, often with little content moderation. While social media companies have been widely criticized for their role in spreading misinformation about the election and Covid-19 vaccines, they have cracked down on both in the last year. Podcasts and the companies distributing them have been spared similar scrutiny, researchers say, in large part because podcasts are harder to analyze and review. “People just have no sense of how bad this problem is on podcasts,” said Valerie Wirtschafter, a senior data analyst at Brookings who co-wrote the report with Chris Meserole, a director of research at Brookings. Dr. Wirtschafter downloaded and transcribed more than 30,000 podcast episodes deemed “talk shows,” meaning they offered analysis and commentary rather than strictly news updates. Focusing on 1,490 episodes around the election from 20 popular shows, she created a dictionary of terms about election fraud. After transcribing the podcasts, a team of researchers searched for the keywords and manually checked each mention to determine if the speaker was supporting or denouncing the claims. In the months leading up to the election, conservative podcasters focused mostly on the fear that mail-in ballots could lead to fraud, the analysis showed. At the time, political analysts were busy warning of a “red mirage”: an early lead by Mr. Trump that could erode because mail-in ballots, which tend to get counted later, were expected to come from Democratic-leaning districts. As ballots were counted, that is precisely what happened. But podcasters used the changing fortunes to raise doubts about the election’s integrity. Election misinformation shot upward, with about 52 percent of episodes containing misinformation in the weeks after the election, up from about 6 percent of episodes before the election. The biggest offender in Brookings’s analysis was Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former adviser. His podcast, “Bannon’s War Room,” was flagged 115 times for episodes using voter fraud terms included in Brookings’ analysis between the election and Jan. 6. “You know why they’re going to steal this election?” Mr. Bannon asked on Nov. 3. “Because they don’t think you’re going to do anything about it.” As the Jan. 6 protest drew closer, his podcast pushed harder on those claims, including the false belief that poll workers handed out markers that would disqualify ballots. “Now we’re on, as they say, the point of attack,” Mr. Bannon said the day before the protest. “The point of attack tomorrow. It’s going to kick off. It’s going to be very dramatic.” Mr. Bannon’s show was removed from Spotify in November 2020 after he discussed beheading federal officials, but it remains available on Apple and Google. When reached for comment on Monday, Mr. Bannon said that President Biden was “an illegitimate occupant of the White House” and referenced investigations into the election that show they “are decertifying his electors.” Many legal experts have argued there is no way to decertify the election. Sean Hannity, the Fox News anchor, also ranked highly in the Brookings data. His podcast and radio program, “The Sean Hannity Show,” is now the most popular radio talk show in America, reaching upward of 15 million radio listeners, according to Talk Media. “Underage people voting, people that moved voting, people that never re-registered voting, dead people voting — we have it all chronicled,” Mr. Hannity said during one episode. Claims about voter fraud came not just from Mr. Hannity but also his guests, including the pollster John McLaughlin, who shared a private exchange he had with Mr. Trump. In the exchange, according to Mr. McLaughlin’s on-air account, Mr. Trump said that the election was stolen. “Yeah,” Mr. McLaughlin said to the president. “I said it yesterday on Hannity radio.” “Keep saying it,” Mr. Trump replied. Mr. McLaughlin went on to say during the podcast: “This election, easily, was stolen and these drop boxes and the Dominion Systems — their voting system — are definitely the culprits.” Claims about Dominion Voting Systems were debunked and internal Republican memos showed officials in Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign knew the claims were false. Dominion later filed a number of lawsuits against people and media companies who pushed the conspiracies. Representatives for Mr. Hannity, Mr. McLaughlin and Mr. Beck did not comment when reached about the findings. Apple’s podcast guidelines say the company does not allow podcasts that “may lead to harmful or dangerous outcomes.” Apple declined to comment. Spotify did not immediately comment on the research. The lack of moderation on podcast apps is particularly complicated for Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube. The video streaming site cracked down on videos about election fraud, the conspiracy theory QAnon, and vaccine misinformation, prompting some podcast episodes hosted there to be removed. But the same episodes remained accessible on Google’s Podcasts app. Mr. Bannon’s show was removed from YouTube shortly after Jan. 6, for instance, but the podcast remains available on Google’s Podcasts app. Google has argued that its Podcasts app more closely resembles a search engine than a publishing service because no audio is hosted by the company. A Google spokesman, Farshad Shadloo, said the app simply “crawls and indexes audio content” hosted elsewhere and that they have “policies against recommending podcasts that contain harmful misinformation, including misinformation about the 2020 U.S. elections.”"

The report lays out a challenging road to recovery for New York, whose economy is underpinned by service industries closely tied to travel and tourism that collapsed at the start of the pandemic in spring 2020 and have been slow to recover. Parts of the city’s economy have thrived during the pandemic — Wall Street firms and lately, residential sales — but the course of the coronavirus will largely dictate how and when New York rebounds, the city agency said. The broader national economy has regained nearly all the jobs lost during the pandemic, but New York has regained only about 35 percent of its lost jobs in 2020, the report said. The prognosis also raises major questions about the impact of hybrid work on the value of office buildings, which pay a significant share of the city’s property taxes, and the future of brick-and-mortar retail, which was struggling even before the pandemic accelerated the move to online shopping. “The increasingly unpredictable nature of the spread of Covid-19 variants continues to confound economic forecasts and will remain one of — if not the primary — risk to the stability of the city’s financial plan,” the report said. The city government has avoided drastic cuts or tax increases because of $22 billion in federal aid for schools and city departments. The Independent Budget Office warned that the assistance has masked the true economic challenges confronting the city. The city’s economy is expected to grow 4.4 percent in 2022, fueled by a demand for workers, but slow considerably in the following years, the agency said. The city could have 4.694 million workers at the end of 2025, a slight increase from the 4.679 million workers at the end of 2019. But one key industry will take longer to recover: leisure and hospitality. By late 2025, the sector is projected to have 100,000 fewer employees than in late 2019 as tourism is slow to rebound and business travel is reduced significantly. A major source of income from tourism, the hotel occupancy tax, could reach $577 million in 2025, up from $85 million in 2021 but still below 2019 levels, the agency said. “With so many New York City residents’ employment and well-being directly tied to the tourism industry, even modest declines in tourism could have major impacts on the city’s economy,” the report said."

The gangs, made up of young people from the Brownsville, East New York and Fort Greene neighborhoods, joined forces in an “umbrella” gang known as YPF to expand their territory and increase their access to guns, Eric Gonzalez, the Brooklyn district attorney, said.  The young men and women, ages 17 to 23, face charges that include second-degree murder, assault and criminal weapon possession. A spokesman for Mr. Gonzalez said that 14 of them were in custody on Tuesday and would be arraigned later in the day. It was unclear whether any of those charged had lawyers as of Tuesday evening.  “I’m going to tell you that we know that law enforcement by itself can’t end gang and gun violence,” Mr. Gonzalez said at a news conference on Tuesday. “But today’s indictments are a big step in getting justice for the victims and improving public safety.” Mayor Eric Adams, who also appeared at the news conference, said that the kind of takedown that resulted in the arrests should be duplicated across New York City.  “We’re not going to live in a culture of violence and we won’t be defined by the crisis of violence,” he said. “That is not who we are as a city. We deserve better, and today, the district attorney showed us that we’re going to get better.” Mr. Gonzalez said the authorities were trying to crack down on “senseless gang and gun violence.” He announced last week that homicides and shootings in the borough had declined in 2021 from the year before and he cited gang takedowns as one reason for the drop.  Law enforcement experts and civil rights advocates have long taken issue with the anti-gang tactics used by law enforcement agencies in New York. These critics say the police often rely on unreliable information in carrying out such actions, classifying too many young men of color as gang members.  Mr. Gonzalez has previously said that gang takedowns done for the sake of appearing tough on crime are meaningless and destructive and that they ignore the main reason people join gangs: for protection.  But he has also said the tactic can be useful when the authorities focus on people who engage in violence. “These investigations are complicated, they’re challenging, but they’re effective and they are necessary,” he said on Tuesday.  Mr. Gonzalez said a “disturbing aspect” of the case announced on Tuesday was the ages of those who were charged. When the investigation began in March 2019, some were as young as 14.  “That is heartbreaking that some of our youngest residents in our county are involved in this gang and gun violence,” he said.  Investigators said the gang members had decided to form the larger alliance under the YPF banner to increase their numbers and geographic dominance, and to expand the territory where they could travel safely.  “As part of this alliance, they all agreed to adopt the rivalries and the enemies of the other gangs,” Mr. Gonzalez said. “So this alliance not only brought these three gangs together and created one bigger gang, but it also increased the amount of violence.” He said the alliance was behind more than a dozen shootings, including one at MetroTech Center in Downtown Brooklyn in September that resulted in a New York University student being shot in the arm.  At the news conference, officials showed surveillance video from an October 2020 episode that they said showed two alliance members firing shots inside a bodega in East New York.  Sherard McKoy, an 18-year-old college freshman who officials said did not have gang ties, was killed in the shooting. Mr. Gonzalez said that although Mr. McKoy was not the intended target, he was with an alleged rival of the two gunmen.  “He was an 18-year-old college student, a freshman,” Mr. Gonzalez said. “A young man who enjoyed playing basketball and had ambitions of being a New York City schoolteacher.” Daijyonna Long, 20, of Virginia, was another victim of the alliance’s coordinated attacks on their rivals, officials said. Ms. Long died after being shot at a birthday party in Brooklyn that the authorities said alliance members showed up to uninvited.  Surveillance video shown at the news conference captured what officials said were two alliance members and two other people opening fire in the apartment building lobby where the party took place.  “She never made it back home to Virginia,” Mr. Gonzalez said of Ms. Long.  Five of those charged face life sentences if convicted of the most serious charges, Mr. Gonzalez said; others face up to 25 years in prison. "
100,The New York Times,nytimes,Here's a look at some of the highlights worth watching from late-night TV.,https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3sZZzee%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2p1UZ1hTaet_iIywkEgRdXiQwW6BVfDItOFaGAvBmzt_qs3rimbSjc_iw&h=AT32jnEYX2GsTeP3THlT5oZud4lmSpWE07c-FDa4s3jeogdNGvfJGgP-7nRGm5VMrXBbQUfN6a3EtKzVsc3vxGYNtNcvxh9sUqD1L7eBXAaGRU69PsQofNHMpVgneco92i0SN6yElLfN1JrSiPr5&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT1__tHnte3it4tl2Ov4-w8yI3GKX6cKAOALpwXXTCLP8CjO1jgw6J-yH-LeBa3shZpeqzg-106iHFEo7K6KUBrwHZXC81aXzubcxA59PVGT18DJnl_yd7cHVbWNXfwYRiUvsiFfCqGUSUNXrdVCd8TsCd7toyb2gYo4skpvT949ohfE,1d,"New York’s prison system unjustly penalized more than 1,600 incarcerated people based on faulty drug tests, putting them in solitary confinement, delaying their parole hearings and denying them family visits, the New York State inspector general said in a damning report released on Tuesday. The arbitrary penalties were meted out across the state over an eight-month period in 2019, while the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision relied on improperly administered drug tests made by the company Microgenics, the report found. The tests led to “rampant false positive” results for buprenorphine, an opioid used to treat addiction, as well as synthetic cannabinoids. “This stands as a heartbreaking example of how the absence of transparency can undermine due process and basic human rights,” Lucy Lang, the inspector general, said at a news conference on Tuesday. The department started using the tests in January 2019, the report found. The manufacturer’s directions specified that a positive result should be confirmed with a second, more sensitive test, but officials neglected to do so as a matter of policy. Instead, they simply carried out the same test a second time to confirm the results. The rate of positive tests immediately spiked, but the department failed to address widespread concerns among prisoners, their families and advocates that many of the results were false positives, the report found. The report cited several examples of the grave consequences the tests had for prisoners. One woman at Albion Correctional Facility, near Rochester, N.Y., who had never tested positive for drug use during her two years in jail, suddenly tested positive for synthetic cannabinoids. As punishment, she was confined to her cell for 40 days and placed in solitary confinement for 45 days. She lost her prison job and privileges like recreation time, receipt of packages and phone use for months. She was also denied visits with her three children. The report also accused Microgenics representatives of presenting false or misleading information to prison officials. A review of internal company documents revealed that even ingesting over-the-counter antacids and the sweetener Stevia could potentially lead to false positives, but the company failed to disclose those possibilities, the report said. The report faulted department officials for deciding to forgo the second test and found that a sales representative from Microgenics had exerted undue influence over the process. It also found that the contract with the company most likely violated procurement guidelines and that the department “did not perform due diligence when contracting with Microgenics for its drug testing systems, failing to understand that such tests were merely preliminary screening tests.” During the eight-month period, more than 1,600 prisoners were punished over drug tests statewide, including 140 who were subjected to solitary confinement, leading to complaints across the state, Ms. Lang said. Prisoners’ Legal Services of New York, an advocacy group, brought the concerns of four incarcerated people who said they had been disciplined based on false positives to the department in June 2019. Later that summer, the department sent six positive test samples from other prisoners to another company for retesting, and five came back negative. The department then brought its findings to the office of the inspector general. It later moved to expunge more than 2,500 disciplinary records that were based on the faulty drug tests. Karen L. Murtagh, the executive director of Prisoners’ Legal Services of New York, said the impact of the penalties was difficult to overstate. “The psychological and physical damage caused by solitary confinement, the loss of family visitation, the lack of proper programming, lost work-release and educational opportunities, all of which help combat recidivism, adds to the ledger for which we as a society need to take account,” she said.  Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, an advocacy group that seeks to dismantle the prison industry, said the report illustrated the problems inherent in allowing private companies to profit from incarceration. She called for further review of prison contracts. In a statement on Tuesday, the department noted that its staff had cooperated with the inspector general’s investigation and adopted all its recommendations, which included ending solitary confinement in response to drug tests and improving drug-test training and data collection. Microgenics is a subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific, a Massachusetts-based company. In a statement on Tuesday, Ron O’Brien, a spokesman for the company, said the instructions clearly state that the drug tests are only preliminary and that a more specific, alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed result. “We have complete confidence in our product and, when it is used as directed, have no reason to believe there is any issue with its accuracy,” Mr. O’Brien said. He added that the company had conducted its own investigation and did not believe that any Microgenics representatives provided “any intentionally false or misleading testimony” at disciplinary hearings, as alleged in the report. The drug tests have spurred several lawsuits, including a federal class-action suit filed by Prisoners’ Legal Services and the law firm Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward & Maazel in 2019. The following year, Letitia James, the New York attorney general, filed suit on behalf of the Department of Corrections against Microgenics in Albany, alleging breach of contract. The lawsuit is pending. The department now uses a preliminary drug screening test known as the Premier Biotech Bio-Cup, and positive results are confirmed using a second method.

But a sexual-abuse lawsuit unfolding in a Manhattan courtroom could yet spoil her celebration. On Tuesday, lawyers for the queen’s second son, Prince Andrew, asked a federal judge to throw out a lawsuit by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, in which she claims that Andrew, a friend of the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, raped her when she was 17. It was the latest in a skein of legal maneuvers by the prince’s lawyers to defuse Ms. Giuffre’s case. While the judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, did not immediately rule on the motion, leaving Andrew’s legal fate unsettled for now, the hearing dramatized the shadow that the 61-year-old prince still casts over his family. If the judge allows the case to go forward, Andrew could face damaging testimony from Ms. Giuffre about his alleged abuse of her at Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York and in the Caribbean. That would plunge the House of Windsor back into scandal at the very moment it hopes to use the Platinum Jubilee to remind Britons of the queen’s extraordinary longevity and largely blemish-free record of service. The 70-minute hearing gave a glimpse into the kinds of issues that could spill out in a prolonged trial. At one point, Prince Andrew’s lead lawyer, Andrew B. Brettler, argued that Ms. Giuffre had not been specific in her allegations against him. Judge Kaplan replied that she claimed she had been subjected to “involuntary sexual intercourse” and asked what was not clear about that. “If the case drags on and on and on, yes, it will be a thorn in the side of the Platinum Jubilee,” said Dickie Arbiter, who served as a press secretary to the queen from 1988 to 2000. Beyond the fraught issues raised in that case, he said, were the lingering questions stirred by the rift between the family and Prince Harry and his American-born wife, Meghan. Harry, the queen’s grandson, plans to publish a memoir late in 2022, which has unsettled people around the royal family who fear further unflattering details about what the estranged prince and Meghan have claimed was callous and racist treatment at the hands of members of the royal family. Andrew’s woes, by contrast, are largely of his own making, royal watchers point out, the product of his association with the disgraced Mr. Epstein and another friend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted last week of conspiring with Mr. Epstein to recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. Ms. Giuffre contends that she was among those victims; Andrew denies her claim that she was trafficked to him. The queen has already largely banished Andrew from public life, a process that gained momentum after a calamitous interview he gave the BBC in November 2019, in which he tried to explain his friendship with Mr. Epstein and denied the allegations of sexual misconduct, saying he had no memory of meeting Ms. Giuffre. He no longer appears at public events, or even military ceremonies, and the British media’s coverage of him is uniformly scathing. When photographers capture Andrew’s image — often at the wheel of a car coming or going to visit his mother — he appears a graying, weary shadow of the once-dashing helicopter pilot who beguiled the country with his service in the Falklands War and his busy bachelorhood. “My gut feeling is that most people have lost interest in him,” said Penny Junor, a royal historian. “He’s arrogant and not particularly popular. Since he’s gone past middle age, there’s been a general sense of ‘what’s he for?’” In one respect, however, Andrew could remain a lingering problem, Ms. Junor said. The queen has not stripped him of his honorary military titles, some of which he inherited from his father, Prince Philip, who died last year. That has prompted objections from veterans, who say it is unseemly to be under the command of a person facing such allegations. Julian Perreira, a former sergeant in the Grenadier Guards who served in Afghanistan, told The Times of London last week, “Being allowed to retain his role as colonel of the Grenadier Guards and other military titles, Prince Andrew will put a stain on the regiment’s proud history and will devalue the hard work of past and future generations of Grenadiers. He must step down immediately.” Prince Harry was stripped of his honorary military titles — as well as the right to use the honorific His Royal Highness — after he and Meghan stepped back from official duties and moved to Southern California. For Andrew to retain his titles, even while being accused of sexual misconduct, strikes some in Britain as the ultimate illustration of a double standard for privileged members of the royal family. It would be all but impossible to defend if he is found guilty of abusing an underage girl. Andrew’s reputation, critics say, has not been helped by his legal maneuvering. Rather than confronting the allegations directly, the prince scrambled to avoid being served with legal papers in Britain. His lawyers have tried to get the case dismissed on jurisdictional grounds and, most recently, on the basis of a settlement agreement between Ms. Giuffre and Mr. Epstein. Under the terms of that 2009 agreement, unsealed on Monday, Mr. Epstein paid Ms. Giuffre $500,000 to resolve a lawsuit in which she accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager. Ms. Giuffre, in turn, agreed to release Mr. Epstein and other “potential defendants” from further litigation, a category that Andrew’s lawyers said included him. But Ms. Giuffre’s lawyer, David Boies, argued in court that Andrew was not a target of the allegations of sexual trafficking made by Ms. Giuffre in 2009. Hence, he is not protected under the terms of the settlement. “He was someone to whom the girls were trafficked,” Mr. Boies told the judge. “He’s not a potential defendant.” While Judge Kaplan did not indicate how he was leaning in whether to dismiss the case, he pointedly allowed the process of gathering evidence to continue. That will keep the legal pressure on Andrew. And it will make for a tense start to the Platinum Jubilee year for the queen, who has already been struggling with health problems that have kept her out of public view since October. The queen, royal watchers note, has been steadfast in her affection for Andrew, even as his public reputation has withered. Having gone along with sidelining her son — a step that was pushed by her eldest son and heir, Prince Charles — some doubt that she would strip Andrew of his titles. “The queen gives and the queen takes away, but she’d probably be reluctant to take this away because that’s all he got left,” Mr. Arbiter said. “She is the head of state and head of the nation, but at the end of the day, she’s also his mother.”"

South Korea’s military said its analysts and U.S. officials were studying the trajectory and other flight data of the North Korean missile to learn more. When North Korea last conducted a missile test, on Oct. 19, it tested a newly developed submarine-launched ballistic missile off its east coast in violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions banning the country from developing or testing ballistic missiles or nuclear devices. “It’s truly regrettable that North Korea has repeatedly launched missiles since last year​,” Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan said​ on Wednesday​. “The Japanese government will strengthen warning and surveillance more than ever.” On Thursday, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said the weapon tested a day earlier was a hypersonic missile. The North conducted its first test of the new missile in September. In the test on Wednesday, the missile hit a target about 435 miles away, the news agency said. Following the launch, the office of President Moon Jae-in of South Korea repeated its call for dialogue with the North, noting that the latest missile test took place when the region could hardly afford instability. China is set to host the Winter Olympics in February, and South Korea will hold its presidential election on March 9. North Korea launched its missile hours before Mr. Moon attended a groundbreaking ceremony on the east coast, where engineers started work on Wednesday to extend the South’s rail line by 69 miles to the inter-Korean border. During their summit meetings in 2018, Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim agreed in principle to link their countries’ rail lines to help boost inter-Korean exchanges. South Korea has long dreamed of transporting its exports by train through North Korea to China, Russia and Europe. But that dream has been on hold as tensions over the North’s nuclear weapons program has stymied the railroad agreement. In one of his last diplomatic initiatives before leaving office,Mr. Moon has also urged the United States and North Korea to join his government in declaring an end to the Korean War, which halted in a truce in 1953. He proposed the declaration as an incentive for North Korea to reduce tension and to denuclearize. But the North has called his proposal premature as long as Washington maintained its “hostile policy.” North Korea has not tested any long-range missiles of the kind that could directly threaten the continental United States since it conducted three intercontinental ballistic missiles in 2017. But since Mr. Kim’s diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump collapsed in 2019, the country has resumed testing mostly short-range missiles, including ones launched from trains rolled out of tunnels​. These tests indicated that the North was developing more sophisticated ways of delivering nuclear and other warheads to South Korea, Japan and American bases, according to defense analysts. ​ Some of the missiles it has tested since 2019 used solid fuel and made midair maneuvers​, making them harder to intercept, defense analysts said. After the I.C.B.M. tests in 2017, Mr. Kim claimed that his country had the ability to launch a nuclear strike against the continental United States. Then he met Mr. Trump three times between 2018 and 2019 to push the United States to ease sanctions​ imposed under U.N. Security Council resolutions. ​ The Kim-Trump diplomacy collapsed without an agreement on rolling back the North’s nuclear weapons program or lifting international sanctions imposed on the country. ​Since then, North Korea has said it would not engage in dialogue again with Washington unless the United States changes its “hostile policy,” including joint military exercises with South Korean and international sanctions​. During a five-day Workers’ Party meeting that ended on Dec. 31 in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, Mr. Kim said his country should focus on alleviating the country’s chronic food shortages — a problem that he inherited from ​Kim Jong-il, ​his father​ and ​predecessor, who died 10 years ago​, ​and has yet to fix. But he also said conditions demanded that “bolstering the state defense capability be further powerfully propelled without a moment’s delay.” The North’s state media reports on the party meeting did not mention any diplomatic overtures toward the United States or South Korea, indicating that the country would continue to stick to its “self-reliant” policy. North Korea ​remains extremely wary of any contact with the outside world during the coronavirus pandemic."

The study, one of the first to examine the health of babies born to women vaccinated during pregnancy, was a reassuring signal. Low-birth-weight babies and infants born early are more likely to experience developmental delays and other health problems. An earlier study had found that women vaccinated during pregnancy did not face a higher risk of miscarriage than the unvaccinated. The new study looked at some 46,079 singleton pregnancies that resulted in a live birth, including some 10,064 among women who received one or more doses of Covid vaccine between Dec. 15, 2020, and July 22, 2021, during their pregnancies. Most had received the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, and the vast majority were inoculated during their second or third trimester. Overall, 6.6 percent of the babies were born prematurely, before 37 weeks of pregnancy, and 8.2 percent were born small for their gestational age, weighing less than 5 pounds and 8 ounces. Researchers found no difference in the rates among mothers who had been vaccinated while pregnant and those who had not. “We plan to do follow-up studies on infants and their development, but there hasn’t been enough time to do them yet,” said Dr. Heather S. Lipkind, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at Yale University and lead author on the new research. The study was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in collaboration with Dr. Lipkind, HealthPartners Institute, Kaiser Permanente researchers and the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute.  The risks of pre-term birth, which appear to be higher when pregnant women are infected with the coronavirus, are well established, she said: “With each week of gestation, the brain develops more. If you have Covid and have to deliver preterm, that can also affect long-term development.” Another benefit to vaccination is that women may pass on coronavirus antibodies to their infants, helping to protect them from illness, Dr. Lipkind added. Pregnant women who become infected face a higher risk of developing severe disease, and federal health officials have implored them to get vaccinated. Nevertheless, vaccination rates remain low among pregnant women — about 31 percent as of late September. Vaccination rates also vary widely by community. While almost half of all pregnant Asian Americans are vaccinated, only 25 percent of pregnant Hispanic women are, and only 15 percent of pregnant Black women, according to the C.D.C. “I can tell you, anecdotally, that in my practice women who are not vaccinated are for sure getting way sicker,” Dr. Lipkind said, “and we’re seeing pre-term birth in pregnant women who had Covid and loss of pregnancy. It’s very, very tragic.” She strongly encourages her patients to get vaccinated, especially now that the highly contagious Omicron variant is circulating. But she often faces fierce resistance, she said. “I think people are just afraid of the unknown in general with pregnancy,” Dr. Lipkind said. “This new research should make people feel a little better about vaccination.”"

Trump on Tuesday abruptly canceled a news conference that he had scheduled at his Mar-a-Lago resort for Thursday evening on the one-year anniversary of the breaching of the United States Capitol. Mr. Trump’s initial decision on Dec. 30 to counterprogram the remembrance events to be held on Capitol Hill had drawn immediate concern from Republicans and allies, who questioned the wisdom of his seizing the spotlight for himself, saying it would be a needless and harmful distraction. Republicans, including Mr. Trump in a statement on Tuesday, have tried to divert attention from the fact that it was the former president’s supporters who turned violent as they sought to stall the certification of the 2020 election, and to falsely blame House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the violence. Mr. Trump’s encouraging speech to supporters on Jan. 6, delivered shortly before the riot, was the centerpiece of his second impeachment by the Democratic-led House of Representatives. He was acquitted by the Senate when it failed to reach a two-thirds majority to convict him of “incitement of insurrection.” In his statement, Mr. Trump faulted both the media and the ongoing House investigation into the assault on the Capitol for his cancellation, but said he would “discuss many of those important topics” at a rally he is planning for Jan. 15 in Arizona. In recent days, according to people familiar with the matter, it became clear that Mr. Trump’s news conference would not likely receive the kind of blanket cable coverage that he generally desires, and some advisers urged the former president to reschedule for a day that would draw less attention to a low point of his presidency. Both President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are scheduled to speak on Thursday, and Speaker Pelosi told lawmakers in a letter last week that there would be a full day of events, including a prayer vigil on the Capitol steps in the early evening. “These events are intended as an observance of reflection, remembrance and recommitment, in a spirit of unity, patriotism and prayerfulness,” she wrote."

He realized there was already an answer in some of the essays and other writing by his father, Norman Mailer, including stark warnings about the fragility of democracy and the threat of political violence. He spoke to J. Michael Lennon, who wrote a biography of Norman Mailer, and together they began planning a collection of Mailer’s work on the subject. That collection, which includes previously unpublished writing from Mailer’s archives and excerpts from letters, manuscripts and interviews, has been acquired by Skyhorse, after Mailer’s longtime publisher, Random House, declined to make an offer on the submission. “He had a fantastic relationship with Penguin Random House,” John Buffalo Mailer said. “We would have liked to have done this book with them.” Publishers that have longstanding relationships with authors often get a first look at their book proposals and manuscripts and are given the opportunity to make a pre-emptive bid, though it isn’t unusual for authors and agents to take their work elsewhere if the offer doesn’t materialize or meet their expectations. The fate of Mailer’s collection, however, generated a heated debate on social media this week, after the journalist Michael Wolff reported in the newsletter The Ankler that Random House had canceled its planned publication of the title because it determined that Mailer — who was famously brash, physically violent, misogynistic and pugnacious in attacking those who disagreed with him — had become too controversial. Citing a Random House source, Mr. Wolff wrote that the publisher was also swayed by “a junior staffer’s objection to the title of Mailer’s 1957 essay, ‘The White Negro.’” The Mailer estate was surprised by Mr. Wolff’s claims. “The reasons that were in that piece were news to me,” John Buffalo Mailer said. Though he was disappointed by Random House’s decision, Mr. Mailer said he doesn’t blame the company for passing on a single title and noted that it continues to publish the bulk of his father’s work. “Why did Random House pass on this book? I think it was because this is the first commercial book of Norman’s that’s going to come out in the era we’re living in, and there’s going to be a lot of questions,” he said. “They didn’t feel they were the right house to do this book right now.” Mr. Mailer added: “I don’t think they have any interest in trying to cancel Norman Mailer. You can’t cancel Norman Mailer.” A spokeswoman for Random House said in a statement that it is “factually incorrect that Random House canceled an upcoming book of essays by Norman Mailer,” adding that the book was never under contract and that Random House continues to publish much of Mailer’s backlist. The literary agent Andrew Wylie, who represents the Mailer estate, wrote in an email that there hadn’t been any falling out between the Mailer estate and his longtime publisher. “There is no issue here. Random House is proud to publish Norman Mailer, and intends to promote his work significantly for the centennial, in tandem with the publication by Skyhorse of the anthology,” he said. “The Mailer family and Random House are united in support of Norman’s work.” Still, the company’s decision unleashed yet another debate over “cancel culture” and censorship. Some argued that publishers have become too fearful of provoking controversy or becoming targets of critical social-media campaigns, and have pulled back from publishing provocative or polarizing authors. Skyhorse, an independent press, has become something of a last refuge for authors. In recent years, it has scooped up titles that were abandoned by other houses, including a memoir by Woody Allen, which Hachette dropped after its own workers protested, and a biography of Philip Roth, which W.W. Norton pulled from circulation after its author, Blake Bailey, was accused of sexual assault and misconduct. In an email, Skyhorse’s president and publisher, Tony Lyons, called Mailer “one of the most dramatic, controversial and enduring writers of his generation” and said the as-yet untitled book is scheduled for release next year. A prolific and combative writer who published around 40 books and was twice awarded the Pulitzer Prize, Norman Mailer was married six times and was also famous for his extraordinary ego. In 1960, at the end of a party announcing his plan to run for mayor of New York City, he stabbed his second wife, Adele Mailer, in the stomach and back with a penknife, seriously wounding her. While collections of Mailer’s writings have been released posthumously before, the Mailer estate felt a new anthology about the need to protect democratic norms would be especially timely, and it aimed to release the book in time for Mailer’s centennial next year. Mr. Lennon, the author of Mailer’s 2013 biography, said that Mailer’s work addressing the tenuous state of democracy was particularly relevant now, in the aftermath of former President Donald J. Trump’s attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and the violence that ensued. “Right now, as the country is in the middle of a self examination over the events that occurred a year ago in Washington, D.C., it is an extremely appropriate time for Norman Mailer’s voice to be heard,” he said. “It was exactly the kind of thing that he feared.” The collection is one of several projects that the estate has planned. John Buffalo Mailer is also working on a television series adapted from Mr. Lennon’s biography. His father would be in favor of the debate over his life and work, and excited about “the reckoning going on right now,” he said. “It is this unique and fascinating opportunity to examine an incredible amount of prescient literary work,” he said. “He’d be the first to say he’s not a perfect human being, but for those of us who are fans of his work, it’s worth working through the challenging parts of his life to reap the benefits of his work.”"
106,The New York Times,nytimes,"Breaking News: Chicago school officials canceled classes for Wednesday amid a clash with the teachers’ union, which wants to pause in-person instruction as the Omicron variant pushes Covid cases in the city to record levels.",https://nyti.ms/3JHPM2w?fbclid=IwAR27i2xKxhglQ3IbI-w09YLnzzNzQaTZe6YOE1n3TewhTLMT8s4MXagpA0M,2d,"In his first big test as mayor of New York City, Eric Adams is resisting pressure from municipal unions and elected officials to do more to stop the spread of the coronavirus as cases and hospitalizations are surging. Mr. Adams is holding firm that schools must stay open, and he is urging employers to have employees return to their offices, despite calls from some union leaders to temporarily return to virtual learning and remote work. With coronavirus cases rising rapidly in recent days, a small but growing list of public school districts around the country — including Newark, Atlanta, Milwaukee and Cleveland — have moved temporarily to remote learning. On Monday night, Philadelphia’s school district announced that 81 schools, out of 216, would go remote.  In an interview on CNN on Tuesday morning, Mr. Adams defended his decision to reopen schools, even though roughly a third of parents did not send their children back to classrooms on Monday for the start of the semester. He continued to argue that students were safer at school. “I’m not going to allow the hysteria to prevent the future of my children receiving a quality education,” Mr. Adams said on CNN. On Tuesday, President Biden, citing the lack of evidence that Omicron more severely impacts children, called for schools to remain open in the United States. Local officials should use federal funds from the stimulus package passed last year to improve ventilation systems in schools and support classrooms large enough for social distancing, he said. “We have no reason to think at this point that Omicron is worse for children than previous variants,” Mr. Biden said. “We know that our kids can be safe when in school.” Mr. Adams, a Democrat who was sworn in on Saturday just after the New Year’s Eve ball dropped in Times Square, also urged companies not to allow employees to work remotely, echoing a message he conveyed Monday on Bloomberg TV: “You can’t run New York City from home.” Mr. Adams insisted on Tuesday that he was not at war with the teachers’ union and its president, Michael Mulgrew, who had called for a temporary return to remote learning. “There’s no battle between Michael Mulgrew and Eric Adams,” Mr. Adams said, adding that they speak three times a day and were working together to keep classrooms safe. Mr. Adams has repeatedly argued that city schools must stay open and that poor children in particular suffered from remote learning. He recently announced, alongside his predecessor and the governor, a plan to distribute millions of rapid at-home tests to schools and increase random surveillance testing among students. New York City reported nearly 30,000 new virus cases on Monday, and the number of people hospitalized has surpassed 5,000, according to state data. That level exceeds last winter’s peak, but is still below the hospitalization rate during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, when 12,000 people were hospitalized on the worst days. There are long lines outside testing centers, as has been the case for weeks, and many private companies have said their employees should continue to work from home. Some public officials have called for more aggressive measures to stop the spread of the virus, including Mark D. Levine, the new Manhattan borough president who has become a leading voice in amplifying the views of health experts. Mr. Levine released a 16-point plan on Monday that called on the city to encourage New Yorkers to avoid large gatherings, to temporarily allow city employees to work from home and to require masks at all indoor settings for vaccinated and unvaccinated New Yorkers. “We need to act now to slow this wave, protect our hospitals, and support the sick,” he said. His plan has received support from leaders including Randi Weingarten, the head of the country’s most powerful teachers union, and Ron T. Kim, a state assemblyman from Queens. In September, then-Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered city employees who had been working from home to return to offices. The city has more than 300,000 workers, and about 80,000 of those who work in offices and had been allowed to work remotely were required to return. As coronavirus cases began to soar in December, the largest union representing city workers called on Mr. de Blasio to implement a remote policy for employees who are able to do their jobs from home. On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the union, District Council 37, said it would continue to push Mr. Adams for a remote policy. “Our nonessential members have proven they can do their jobs from home,” the spokeswoman, Freddi Goldstein, said. “There’s no reason to keep them in the office risking their health.” Mr. Adams, who is close with District Council 37 leaders, has said that he would discuss the policy with unions."

Trump and his staff in the days surrounding the riot. In a letter on Tuesday, the committee asked for Mr. Hannity’s voluntary cooperation, meaning that the host has not received a formal subpoena. The letter detailed a series of text messages between the conservative media star and senior officials in the Trump White House, illustrating Mr. Hannity’s unusually elevated role as an outside adviser to the administration. The texts suggest that Mr. Hannity was aware of, and deeply concerned about, what Mr. Trump was planning for Jan. 6, and bracing for a possible mass resignation of top White House lawyers as a result. “We can’t lose the entire WH counsels office,” Mr. Hannity wrote to Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, in a Dec. 31, 2020, text message that the committee included in its letter. “I do NOT see January 6 happening the way he is being told.” They also indicate that the Fox News host, a longtime confidant of the former president, had knowledge of a flurry of high-level conversations at the White House, involving Mr. Trump himself, about leaning on Vice President Mike Pence to use his ceremonial role in Congress’s official electoral count to keep Mr. Trump in office. “Pence pressure,” Mr. Hannity wrote in a Jan. 5 message. “WH counsel will leave.” The texts were included in a trove of 9,000 pages of documents Mr. Meadows turned over to the panel in response to a subpoena. As Mr. Trump grappled with the political fallout of the attack — including a looming impeachment inquiry and rebukes from some top Republicans — Mr. Hannity wrote on Jan. 10 to Mr. Meadows and Representative Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican and a key ally. “He can’t mention the election again. Ever,” Mr. Hannity said in the message, referring to Mr. Trump. “I did not have a good call with him today. And worse, I’m not sure what is left to do or say, and I don’t like not knowing if it’s truly understood. Ideas?” A lawyer for Mr. Hannity, Jay Sekulow, said on Tuesday that the committee’s request “would raise serious constitutional issues including First Amendment concerns regarding freedom of the press.” Fox News referred inquiries to Mr. Sekulow’s statement. The letter from the committee informed Mr. Hannity that it believed the Fox News host “had advance knowledge regarding President Trump’s and his legal team’s planning for Jan. 6,” calling him “a fact witness in our investigation.” The committee wrote that it had obtained “dozens of text messages” between Mr. Hannity and members of Mr. Trump’s inner circle, including a note on Jan. 5 in which Mr. Hannity expressed concern about the next day’s counting of Electoral College votes. “I’m very worried about the next 48 hours,” Mr. Hannity wrote. Mr. Hannity was one of several Fox News stars who became informal confidants to Mr. Trump over the course of his administration, frequently conversing with the president by telephone and over meals in the White House. “He was more than a Fox host; he was also a confidant, adviser, campaigner for the former president,” Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat and member of the committee, said on MSNBC on Tuesday. Last month, the committee revealed that Mr. Hannity had contacted Mr. Meadows on Jan. 6 as rioters overtook the Capitol, asking: “Can he make a statement? Ask people to leave the Capitol.” The Fox News stars Laura Ingraham and Brian Kilmeade sent similar notes asking that Mr. Trump take steps to quell the violence. In Fox News prime time on Jan. 6, Mr. Hannity told his viewers that “all of today’s perpetrators must be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” adding: “Every good and decent American, we know, will and must condemn what happened at the Capitol.” A spokesman for the committee declined to say on Tuesday if additional Fox News hosts would be asked to answer questions. Mr. Hannity is the most prominent media star so far that the committee has contacted about testifying. The committee previously issued a subpoena for the conspiracy theorist and Infowars host Alex Jones, who has sued the committee to try to stonewall the investigation. The letter to Mr. Hannity was signed by Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the committee chairman, and its vice chairwoman, Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming. “We have no doubt that you love our country and respect our Constitution,” Mr. Thompson and Ms. Cheney wrote. “Now is the time to step forward and serve the interests of your country.”"

The agency guidelines, released last week, shortened the recommended isolation period from 10 days to five for infected people who do not have symptoms, or whose symptoms are resolving. But the agency did not recommend testing before leaving isolation, an omission that surprised and worried many outside experts. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director, told The New York Times last week that the recommendation was based on evidence showing that the vast majority of transmissibility happens in the two days before symptoms and the two to three days after onset. The guidelines suggested that following isolation, recovered people wear a mask around others for another five days. Dr. Walensky defended the decision to omit testing, saying that rapid tests are not reliable for determining when an individual is no longer contagious. The Food and Drug Administration also said last week that rapid tests might be less reliable at picking up Omicron, compared with infections caused by previous variants. But the agency declined to elaborate on the basis for that assertion. Many public health experts said ending isolation at five days was risky, and that the agency should at least urge people to test negative before mingling with others. They also derided the agency for what some saw as a capitulation to pressure from corporations buckling under staff shortages during the Omicron surge. Responding to some of the criticisms, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top coronavirus adviser, said on Sunday that the C.D.C. was considering adding testing to its recommendations, and would clarify the guidance within days. The agency was widely expected to add testing to its guidance as early as Tuesday. But in a surprising move, officials updated the C.D.C. website without a testing requirement. The agency on Tuesday also provided scientific rationale for shortening the isolation period. The guidelines now say that an individual who “has access to a test and wants to test” at the end of the isolation period may do so, but stops short of a recommendation to test. The new guidelines “facilitate individual social and well-being needs, return to work, and maintenance of critical infrastructure,” according to an update posted on Tuesday to the agency’s website. For people exposed to the virus who are unvaccinated or have not yet received a booster dose of one of the vaccines, the agency now recommends a quarantine of five days, followed by strict mask use for another five. People who have received a booster shot do not need to quarantine following an exposure, but should wear a mask for 10 days afterward, according to the guidelines."

It’s when he thinks most about the dream he wanted so badly, to drive a bobsled in the ultimate competition. It’s gone, and so is the friend who helped him chase it. Sisson knows how much worse it could have been, how fortunate he is to walk the sideline at high school football games, hustling players on and off the field, nearly two decades after flipping the bobsled he was driving at 80 miles per hour down the ice in St. Moritz, Switzerland. He does not understand why he struggles only with a quadrennial melancholy and some attention difficulties while so many of his friends from the sport battle depression and addiction or memory loss. Three of them have died by suicide, including his mentor and big brother in the sport, Travis Bell, another athlete from the vast and tiny state of Wyoming who is often on his mind. Like Sisson, Bell had a catastrophic crash, and also many other brain-rattling rides that took a toll. But Sisson’s brain recovered, and Bell’s did not. In the fall, Sisson pulled his sled out of storage in his garage. He wiped dust off the tail and from the spot where the words “in memory of” were painted next to an image of Bell. “I’ve got survivor’s guilt big time,” Sisson said. For years, football and ice hockey have dominated discussions about long-term brain injuries in sports. In bobsled — and its sister sport, skeleton — athletes, coaches and officials paid little attention to such injuries until recently. There was a name for the nausea, dizziness, exhaustion and momentary blackouts experienced after a brain-rattling run: They called it sledhead. And yet a mystery lingers. Some athletes, even those who crash violently, slide for years with no lasting symptoms. But debilitating health problems, overdoses and recent deaths by suicide among retired athletes have forced the sport to confront evidence that sliding sports can pose long-term danger to brain health. The Beijing Olympics next month will be the first Winter Games since the brain of a U.S. Olympic bobsledder who died by suicide in 2020 was found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., the degenerative brain disease caused by multiple head traumas. Sisson, who is now a teacher and the strength and conditioning coach for the Morgan High School football team, was 21 when he crashed, and he hardly competed afterward. The first doctor to treat him said leaving competitive bobsledding so young might help explain why Sisson is able to endure bright lights and run weight training sessions as hip-hop and heavy metal music blares, settings that would be unbearable for many former sliders. The crash that nearly killed Sisson, the one that cut short his career and kept him from many more years of sledding, possibly saved his life. Sisson was a football player in Evanston, Wyo., near the Utah border, in the mid-1990s, when a neighbor was hosting Jamaica’s bobsled team, which trained in Park City, Utah, ahead of the 1998 Olympics. Sisson, who began dreaming of going to the Olympics when he was 4, wanted in. He started down the track in 1997, when he was 17, and soon met Bell, an elite snowmobile competitor and rising driver on the U.S. bobsled team who had grown up on the other side of Wyoming, in Laramie. Chuck Bell, Travis’s father, said that even as a boy his son had an adventurous streak. He rode bulls at the county fair and raced stock cars as a teenager. Bobsled coaches asked him to try their sport after they saw him make the top 10 in his rookie appearance at a national snowmobile race in Jackson Hole when he was in his early 20s. Bell aced the tryout, then quickly started piling up wins as a rookie on the America’s Cup, the sport’s lower-level tour.  He practiced relentlessly, sometimes taking as many as 15 runs in a day, and eventually welcomed Sisson into the back of his sled any time he needed a pusher. Sisson told Bell that he, too, wanted to be a driver. So Bell talked to him for hours on end about strategy and shared his notes on every track. “He wrote out this whole long thing where I had to pledge to ‘keep my pie hole shut’ about all the information he was giving me,” Sisson said. Bell also confessed to Sisson that he occasionally blacked out while driving the sled. Sometimes, Bell told him, he would cross the finish line and not remember three or four turns — unsettling words for the teammate in the back. Everything changed in January 1999, while Bell was filming a car commercial for the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. As he cruised down the track, a camera mounted to his sled flew off and was sucked underneath, forcing the sled into the air. Bell’s head crashed into the roof of the track. He called his father on the way to the hospital. He said his injury was bad but that he was OK. He wasn’t. Bell, then 27, had sustained multiple brain bleeds and microscopic tears in his brain’s white matter, a result of shearing that occurred when his brain suddenly shifted directions, said his former wife, Sunrise. There was swelling, too, and for a time it was unclear if he would survive. Doctors told him another crash could be catastrophic. He sued General Motors and the production company hired to make the commercial, seeking as much as $20 million. In 2002, he secured a settlement that he described at the time as large enough to allow him not to work for a few years, if he lived frugally, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. The money, though, did little to relieve Bell’s cascading health problems. There were the seizures and migraine headaches and chronic pain that doctors treated with opioids such as Vicodin and OxyContin. He became addicted, which contributed to the demise of his marriage. In 2014, Bell killed himself. It was his second attempt. He was 42. “In reality, he died the day that crash happened,” Chuck Bell said. “He never recovered from it.” Sisson cannot remember thinking about Bell or his crash before or after his own fateful run down a track in St. Moritz in early 2002. He can’t remember anything from that time. Six weeks of his life are blank. He pieced together details of the crash, which occurred during a practice run, as a forensic scientist would: by studying the helmet and the sled, and talking with teammates, officials and the doctors who treated him. He had stayed up until 4 a.m., local time, the night before the crash, watching the Super Bowl. He overslept and rushed to the track for training. Pressed for time, he neglected to check the sled before pushing off. He quickly realized that the steering mechanism had frozen, making a crash almost inevitable. He avoided disaster for eight turns. On the ninth turn, a nasty horseshoe-shape curve, his luck ran out. The black helmet Sisson wore that day, along with two other scraped and dented ones from his career, sit atop a cabinet in his classroom at Morgan High School, where he teaches geography, history, psychology and weight training. As he cradled it and pointed to the dings and peeled paint, he explained how he thinks an initial impact, between the edge of the wall and his helmet’s chin covering, knocked him unconscious. A whack to the back left side of the head caused further damage. The sled flipped, and Sisson slid hundreds of yards more, his head wedged between the wall and the 400-pound sled, until the sled finally slowed in the finish area. He was airlifted to a trauma center 50 miles away. Back home in Wyoming, his parents got a phone call saying not to come to Switzerland because it was unlikely he would survive. His mother, father and stepfather scrambled to get passports that day and got on the first available flight. The doctors who evaluated Sisson at the hospital in Chur, Switzerland, gave him a score of five on the Glasgow Coma Scale, which starts at three for patients who are essentially unresponsive and goes as high as 15 for less severe victims of head injuries. “Five is very low,” said Dr. Gian-Reto Kleger, the specialist who supervised Sisson’s treatment in Switzerland. A CT scan revealed bleeding in multiple areas of the brain, though the lesions were not large enough to require removal. Instead, Kleger drilled a hole in Sisson’s skull to treat the potentially damaging effects of swelling, drain excess fluid and insert a device to monitor the pressure. Doctors kept him in a coma for four days. Twenty years later, Kleger still does not know why the pressure in Sisson’s skull remained low given the severity of the crash. He thinks Sisson’s brain may not have sheared the way brains often do when the skull rotates violently during a high-speed crash, causing lesions throughout the brain tissue rather than the targeted bleeding that can occur in a head-on impact. Sisson’s age — his “young brain” — also most likely played a role. Doctors classify brains older than 25 to 30 as “old.” “It’s a fascinating thing,” the doctor said. “A young brain is just so much better at healing.” A week after his crash, Sisson and his mother flew back to Salt Lake City, the host city for the 2002 Winter Olympics, on a special medical jet. He checked into the brain rehabilitation unit of the L.D.S. Hospital, where Dr. Andrew Dodds, the attending physician, took over his care. In those first days, Sisson was confused about where he was. His eyes and facial expression had the flat affect of someone who is there but not really there. He struggled with memory and balance. He tired easily. Noise and bright lights overstimulated and agitated him, though Misti Timpson, a physical therapist who helped with his rehab, said he never lashed out the way brain injury patients often do. “He was the nicest agitated person I have ever met,” Timpson said. “He would say: ‘Excuse me, ladies, I am getting agitated. I suggest you step away.’ And only then would he scream or strike out or cover himself with a blanket.” After a little more than a week, Dodds cleared him to attend an Olympic medal ceremony in Salt Lake City with an aide. Bell was there. Sisson has a photo of the two of them embracing that night, though he has no memory of the moment. After another week, Sisson had improved enough to go home, though doctors monitored him for a year, slowly clearing him to use knives and kitchen appliances, then to drive and enroll in some college classes that did not involve math or languages or much memorization. “I’m convinced that Joe was saved because he was 21 and didn’t have the cumulative trauma from sliding injuries that his friend probably had,” Dodds said. A little less than two years later, Sisson asked Dodds if he could try bobsledding again. The doctor was hesitant, and consulted with a neurosurgeon, but Sisson seemed back to normal, so he cleared him. The comeback was short-lived. In January 2005, Sisson flipped his sled on one of the last turns on the track in Lake Placid, N.Y. The crash spooked his wife, who told him his career as an elite bobsledder was over. He still loves the sport, still takes the occasional joy ride down the track in Park City. Sometimes he takes players from his football team. His goal now is to pass the test that will give him the certification he needs to work as a strength and conditioning coach at the college level. The test requires learning a lot of scientific terms, which remains a challenge. It also costs $400. He signed up for it in December. “That’s the kind of money I don’t have to take a test if I am going to fail it,” he said. Dodds is semiretired. A few years after he cleared Sisson to try bobsledding again, the doctor did something he had never done: He folded his 6-foot-5 frame into the back of a sled at the Park City track. Within seconds, the doctor said, he was in excruciating pain, his body and head slamming around as the sled careened down the hill. He underwent an examination to make sure he did not have a spinal cord injury. When he next saw Timpson, the physical therapist, at the hospital, he told her he had made a big mistake. If he had known what the body and the brain endured during a bobsled run, he never would have cleared Sisson to compete again."

In a memo sent to employees that was obtained by The New York Times, the retailer — which also owns Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury — told workers in the United States to upload their vaccination statuses to a third-party platform by Jan. 16 “regardless of whether you work in a store, a supply chain facility, an office, or are remote/hybrid.” For employees who say they are unvaccinated, Macy’s said it would “review your submission and you may be contacted by someone from the Colleague Advisory team to discuss next steps.” The company also said it might require proof of negative tests to be uploaded to the same system starting on Feb. 16. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hold the hearing this week to assess the legality of two measures from the Biden administration: a vaccine-or-testing mandate aimed at large employers and a vaccination requirement for certain health care workers. The retail industry had pushed back on a new rule issued in November by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requiring companies with 100 or more workers to mandate vaccines or weekly tests, saying it could intensify a labor shortage that many retailers were dealing with during the busy holiday season. Since then, the Omicron variant has sent global coronavirus cases to record levels, though recent data shows that people infected with it are far less likely to be hospitalized than those infected with the Delta variant, especially if they are vaccinated. Macy’s said separately on Tuesday that it planned to shorten store hours from Monday through Thursday for the rest of January amid the spike and staffing shortages. The news was reported earlier by CNBC. The National Retail Federation, a major industry lobbying group, said in a statement on Tuesday that it “continues to believe that OSHA exceeded its authority in promulgating its vaccine mandate, and we look forward to making that argument before the Supreme Court on Friday.” The group estimated that the order would require 20 million tests a week nationally, based on external data on unvaccinated workers, and that “such testing capacity currently does not exist.” Still, the memo from Macy’s, which has tens of thousands of employees, suggests that the industry is preparing to carry out the rule. Macy’s also said in its memo that it would adopt the new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that recommended shortening isolation periods for infected people to five days from 10 if they are asymptomatic or their symptoms are resolving. The retailer asked in the fall that its corporate staff either be vaccinated or test negative for Covid-19 before returning to the office, but it did not make the same request of store employees. When asked about the memo, a Macy’s representative said in an email that the retailer was “working to comply with federal and local guidelines related to Covid.”"

A 40-mile stretch of the highway — one of the busiest travel corridors in the United States — came to a standstill overnight after a fast-falling snowstorm led to jackknifed tractor-trailers and hundreds of other accidents. Some people abandoned their cars. Many, including a U.S. senator, spent the night on the snowy highway. As people spent a sleepless night in driver’s seats and truck cabs, state troopers slowly trudged from person to person, helping when they could with supplies. Tow trucks dragged car after disabled car out of the ice. “It’s been so horrible,” Arlin Tellez, 22, said in an interview on Tuesday morning from her car on the highway in Caroline County, Va., about 80 miles south of Washington. She had been trapped there since 5 p.m. Monday without any food or water, and was layering on clothes she had in the car. “There’s just no way for us to know what’s actually happening,” she said. “When we tried to call the police, because at this point that was our only resource, they literally just told us to hang on tight.” The interstate reopened on Tuesday night after Virginia state officials said that they had been working to clear several hundred vehicles off I-95. With slick roadways still possible, the Virginia Department of Transportation said drivers should avoid unnecessary travel overnight and on Wednesday morning. “We were prepared for the storm that was predicted — a few inches of snow — but instead, Mother Nature sent more than a foot of snow to the Fredericksburg area,” Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia said at a news conference on Tuesday afternoon.  The Virginia State Police said they had not received any reports of injuries or deaths related to the storm, but the authorities around the Mid-Atlantic said it had caused at least five deaths. Officials said the storm began on Monday with rain, which would have washed away road salts, and quickly overwhelmed efforts to keep the highway clear. Rain turned to sleet and then snow, which fell at a rate of two inches an hour for four to five hours, according to Marcie Parker, a Virginia Department of Transportation engineer. “That was entirely too much for us to keep up with,” she told reporters on Tuesday. Cars and trucks slowed, and then stopped, on their way up and down hills. At least one tractor-trailer slid sideways across the highway. In some places, Ms. Parker said, four inches of ice froze underneath vehicles. Corinne Geller, a spokeswoman for the Virginia State Police, said the authorities had responded to more than 1,000 traffic crashes and more than 1,000 disabled or stuck vehicles statewide. “We don’t believe that accounts for the vehicles on the 95 stretch,” she said. The snowstorm trapped truckers, students, families and every stripe of commuter, including Tim Kaine, the junior U.S. senator from Virginia and a former Democratic nominee for vice president. His ordeal began at about 1 p.m. on Monday, as his normal two-hour commute to the Capitol was disrupted by the gathering accidents and snow. “I’m extremely tired,” Mr. Kaine said in a phone interview on Tuesday afternoon as he arrived in Washington, having spent more than 20 hours stuck in his vehicle. “I had to sleep in my car last night on an ice-packed interstate with a ton of other cars.” He said he left his car on for 30 minutes at a time to charge his phone, make calls and warm up, then turned it off to save gas and to sleep for 20 minutes or so, only to be wakened by the cold. When he wasn’t napping, Mr. Kaine said, he passed the time by sipping Dr Pepper, listening to SiriusXM radio and eating small wedges of an orange that another stranded driver had given him. He said he regretted his habit of skipping breakfast. “I’m going to walk into the office right now, and I’m going to drink some water,” he said. “And I’m going to eat some potato chips or something salty, and I’m going to use a restroom.” Meera Rao and her husband, Raghavendra Rao, said they received notice about traffic conditions only after 15 hours in Caroline County. “I never thought I would be on a road near Washington, D.C., and not be able to move my vehicle an inch or two,” Mr. Rao said. Around 9 a.m. on Tuesday, someone cleared an exit near their car and they were able to move.  “We saw so many accidents ourselves, I was just praying for all of them,” Ms. Rao said. Jen Travis, a marketing agency owner from Sterling, Va., said she, her husband and their 12-year-old daughter got stuck near Fredericksburg, Va., around 2:30 a.m., as they were returning from a vacation at Universal Orlando Resort. Their road trip began after two canceled airline flights in Florida. Ms. Travis, 42, said the family had no food since they stopped for dinner around 7 p.m. on Monday, and that she had not gone to the bathroom since then, either. “I’m telling you, my bladder is about ready to burst,” she said. “Then we’re in the middle of Covid,” she added. “How do you walk up to a random house and say, ‘Can we use your bathroom? By the way, can you take a PCR test?’” Filling stations and convenience stores did steady business, at least once drivers were able to get to them. An employee who answered the phone at a Sheetz gas station in Woodford, Va., on Tuesday afternoon said customers had been streaming in — many on foot, having walked about a quarter-mile from the highway. “We don’t have much of anything left,” said the employee, who gave only his first name, Jason. Asked whether the station was out of fuel, he said, “We’re about to be.” The bad weather also disrupted rail traffic in Virginia. An Amtrak train that was on its way to New York from New Orleans returned to the station in Lynchburg, Va., after coming to a stop north of there on Monday, according to passengers who said they had been told that downed trees were blocking the tracks. Malcolm Kenton, who was on his way to Washington from Greensboro, N.C., said Amtrak gave passengers the choice of leaving when the train returned to Lynchburg. Mr. Kenton disembarked and spent the night at a hotel. “The train ran out of food at 6 p.m.,” he said. “It wasn’t officially announced, but we started hearing discussion that some of the toilets weren’t working. We just weren’t willing to risk having to spend the night on a train with no food and no working toilets.” The storm caused problems around the region, burying parts of Virginia in more than 15 inches of snow, and knocking out power for hundreds of thousands of customers in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee. Monday’s storm led to the deaths of at least five people. In Maryland, two women and a man died after their vehicle collided with a snow plow, according to the Montgomery County Police Department. Local news outlets in Tennessee and Georgia reported that a child in each state had died after trees fell onto their homes. As agencies worked to clear the roadways, drivers finally started to move. Marvin Romero, 34, an audio-video field engineer from Brooklyn, N.Y., said on Tuesday that he was driving with his two daughters, 10 and 8, back from a family vacation in Florida when they hit traffic around 3 p.m. on Monday in Virginia. From about 10 p.m. until Tuesday morning, his Hyundai Tucson compact S.U.V. did not move. At one point, Mr. Romero gave his daughters sparklers to pass the time. At another, he wrapped them in blankets while they slept. “I knew I couldn’t leave my car on all night,” Mr. Romero said. “I was worried about food, gas, my daughters. How are they going to sleep? The closest hotel to us walking was an hour away.” As of 1:45 p.m. on Tuesday, Mr. Romero said that he was moving again. He still had a long drive ahead of him, according to his GPS. “It’s telling me 1 o’clock in the morning right now,” he said. "

The sounds of a beam-me-up transporter wafted across the room. Over his shoulder, a wall was filled with an enormous photograph of his father — Leonard Nimoy, who played Spock on the show — dressed in his Starfleet uniform, his fingers splayed in the familiar Vulcan “live long and prosper” greeting. But that gesture, Adam Nimoy noted as he led a visitor through this exhibition at the Skirball Cultural Center, was more than a symbol of the television series that defined his father’s long career playing the part-Vulcan, part-human Spock. It is derived from part of a Hebrew blessing that Leonard Nimoy first glimpsed at an Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Boston as a boy and brought to the role. The prominently displayed photo of that gesture linking Judaism to Star Trek culture helps account for what might seem to be a highly illogical bit of programming: the decision by the Skirball, a Jewish cultural center known mostly for its explorations of Jewish life and history, to bring in an exhibition devoted to one of television’s most celebrated sci-fi shows. But walking through the artifacts Adam Nimoy recalled how his father, the son of Ukrainian Jews who spoke no English when they arrived, had said he identified with Spock, pointing out that he was “the only alien on the bridge of the Enterprise.” Jewish values and traditions were often on the minds of the show’s writers as they dealt with issues of human behavior and morality, said David Gerrold, a writer whose credits include “The Trouble with Tribbles,” one of the most acclaimed “Star Trek” episodes, which introduces the crew to a cute, furry, rapidly reproducing alien life form. “A lot of Jewish tradition — a lot of Jewish wisdom — is part of ‘Star Trek,’ and ‘Star Trek’ drew on a lot of things that were in the Old Testament and the Talmud,” Gerrold said in an interview. “Anyone who is very literate in Jewish tradition is going to recognize a lot of wisdom that ‘Star Trek’ encompassed.” That connection was not explicit when the show first aired. And a stroll through the exhibition, which covers the original television show as well as some of the spinoffs and films that came to encompass the “Star Trek” industry, mainly turns up items that are of interest to “Star Trek” fans. There is a navigation console from the U.S.S. Enterprise, the first script from the first episode, a Klingon disrupter from “Star Trek: The Next Generation,” and a display of tribbles. To some extent, the choice of this particular exhibition — “Star Trek: Exploring New Worlds” — to help usher the Skirball back into operation after a Covid shutdown reflects the imperatives museums everywhere are facing as they try to recover from a pandemic that has been so economically damaging. “These days — honestly, especially after the pandemic — museums are looking for ways to get people through the door,” said Brooks Peck, who helped create the show for the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle. “Museums are struggling to find an audience and are looking for a pop culture hook.” It seems to have worked. The “Star Trek” exhibition has drawn 12,000 attendees in its first two months here, a robust turnout given that the Skirball is limiting sales to 25 percent of capacity. “This has been bringing in new people, no question,” said Sheri Bernstein, the museum director. “Attendance is important for the sake of relevance. It’s important for us to bring in a diverse array of people.” Jessie Kornberg, the president of Skirball, said that the center had been drawn by the parallels between Judaism and the television show. “Nimoy’s Jewish identity contributed to a small moment which became a big theme,” she said. “We actually think the common values in the ‘Star Trek’ universe and Jewish belief are more powerful than that symbolism. That’s this idea of a more liberal, inclusive people, where ‘other’ and ‘difference’ is an embraced strength as opposed to a divisive weakness.” The intersections between the television series and Judaism begin with its two stars, Nimoy and William Shatner, who played Capt. James T. Kirk. “These are two iconic guys in outer space who are Jewish,” said Adam Nimoy. And it extends to the philosophy that infuses the show, created by Gene Roddenberry, who was raised a Southern Baptist but came to consider himself a humanist, according to his authorized biography. Those underlying connections are unmistakable for people like Nimoy, 65, a television director who is both a devoted “Star Trek” fan and an observant Jew: He and his father often went to services in Los Angeles, and Friday night Sabbath dinners were a regular part of their family life. Nimoy found no shortage of Jewish resonances and echoes in the exhibition, which opened in October and closes on Feb. 20. He stopped at a costume worn by a Gorn, a deadly reptilian extraterrestrial who was in a fight-to-the-death encounter with Kirk. “When he gets the Gorn to the ground, he’s about to kill him,” Nimoy recounted. “The Gorn wants to kill Kirk. But something happens. Instead he shows mercy and restraint and refuses to kill the Gorn.” “Very similar to the story of Joseph,” Nimoy said, referring to the way Joseph, in the biblical book of Genesis, declined to seek retribution against his brothers for selling him into slavery. Leonard Nimoy died in 2015 at the age of 83. Shatner, who is 90 and recently became the oldest person to go into space, declined to discuss the exhibition. “Unfortunately Mr. Shatner’s overcommitted production schedule precludes him from taking on any additional interviews,” said his assistant, Kathleen Hays. The Skirball Cultural Center is set on 15 acres, about 20 miles from downtown Los Angeles. The exhibition ran for about two years in Seattle after opening in 2016 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the original “Star Trek” TV show’s 1966 debut. (That version was on NBC for three seasons.) The exhibition had been intended to tour, but those plans were cut short when the pandemic began to close museums across the country. The exhibition was assembled largely from the private collection of Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft and founder of the Museum of Pop Culture, who died in 2018. Peck said he wanted to commemorate the anniversary of the series with an exhibition that explored the outsize influence the television show had on American culture. “The answer that I am offering is that ‘Star Trek’ has endured and inspired people because of the optimistic future it presents — the good character of many of its characters,” Peck said. “They are characters that people would like to emulate.” “Skirball faced a bit of a challenge in trying to explain to its audience how ‘Star Trek' fit in with what they do,” he said. “Happily it completely worked out. I had always hoped that Skirball could take it. Skirball’s values as an institution so align with the values of ‘Star Trek’ and the ‘Star Trek’ community.” Bernstein, the Skirball director, said the exhibition seemed a particularly good way to help bring the museum back to life. “There was never a better time to present this show than now,” she said. “We very much liked the idea of reopening our full museum offerings with a show that was about inspiring hope. A show that promised enjoyment.” By spring, ‘Star Trek’ will step aside for a less surprising offering, an exhibition about Jewish delis, but for now, the museum is filled both with devotees of Jewish culture, admiring a Torah case from China, and Trekkies, snapping pictures of the captain’s chair that Kirk sat in aboard the Enterprise. “There is no such thing as too much ‘Star Trek,’” Scott Mantz, a film critic, said as he began interviewing Adam Nimoy after a recent screening at the museum of “For the Love of Spock,” a 2016 documentary Nimoy had made about his father. A long burst of applause rose from his audience."

It was sexist in nature but quite witty and clever. While many of us in the meeting groaned in disbelief, three employees laughed out loud. The manager has been suspended by human resources. Should the people who laughed at the comment, two men and one woman, also be disciplined? Is a reflex reaction to a comment less egregious than “liking” an objectionable social media post? Name Withheld, Bedford, N.Y. Pressing “like” on a social media post is something people do on their own time. I’m inclined to think that employers have been too eager to make after-hours activity their business; as scholars like Elizabeth Anderson and Jeannette Cox show us, such monitoring comes at a serious cost to the freedom of expression we think we enjoy. By contrast, management has a legitimate interest in the way people behave at company meetings, because it directly affects the workplace atmosphere. Employees shouldn’t be made to feel uncomfortable because of things like gender, sexual orientation, race or religion — and, of course, there are legal as well as ethical aspects to the stricture. It’s wrong, however, to penalize someone for laughing at a joke, not the least because laughter is sometimes a response to shocked embarrassment. The job of human resources, in any case, is to assess our conduct, not to plumb our souls. Making that inappropriate remark was clearly a choice, as laughing at it might not have been. The penalty paid by the speaker in question sufficiently communicates that the company intends to avoid creating a hostile work environment. I am a psychiatrist. One of my patients moved to another state five years ago, but I still provide him with psychotherapy and prescriptions. I accept his insurance payment as payment in full. Still, he feels the need to send me gifts (usually some kind of food) every month — often something I don’t even like. I have to figure out whom to give the stuff to; sometimes I have to throw the items away. I have repeatedly told him that he does not need to do that, but the packages continue to arrive. While I greatly appreciate the good will he is showing toward me, I hate to be wasteful. He is not a wealthy man and shouldn’t spend money on this. Every time I think about telling him that I don’t want any more gifts, I hesitate because I fear that doing so could damage what is a very positive doctor-patient relationship. Name Withheld Maintaining appropriate boundaries is a key part of a proper professional relationship. The trouble is that you’ve allowed this to go on for far too long. So shifting from “You don’t have to” to “I wish you wouldn’t” does augur an awkward conversation. Still, I’m sure you have the diplomatic skills to tell him, kindly but firmly, that as appreciative as you are of the thought behind these gifts, you have to ask that they stop. As a psychiatrist, you might consider the possibility that you’re more worried than you should be about what may well be a brief period of shared embarrassment. For several summers after I left home, my aunt and uncle would go to visit my mother and my sister. After my aunt and uncle died, my sister, who is my only sibling, received several hundred thousand dollars from their will, while I got nothing. I was close to my sister, but this has caused a serious rift. She says she was always nice to them during their stays and always sent holiday cards. She does not plan on splitting her inheritance with me, even though she is in a much better financial situation. We are both in our 70s. Am I being unreasonable in thinking she should include me in her windfall? Name Withheld If your sister had won the lottery, would she owe you half her winnings? You evidently think that your aunt and uncle should have treated the two of you equally. But you and your sister didn’t treat them equally. Either way, they were free to leave her money as they chose, and your sister was free to accept it. My mother-in-law, who lives alone, was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. She struggles with completing things by due dates, filling out forms, paying bills, managing technology and keeping track of appointments. We’ve been helping her with all these things. Now driving has become an issue. She has not had any accidents, but her friends have shared concerns about her driving, and she reported that her car was stolen when she couldn’t remember where she parked it. Her neurologist advised that she not drive again until she takes a driving test. Paperwork arrived from the Department of Motor Vehicles, which she has to fill out on time in order to schedule her test. My question is: How much do we help with the paperwork? She went and got the books to study for the test but then couldn’t recall having done so. Is it ethical to help her complete the forms, make the necessary calls and send them off on time, when there is a risk to others if she does in fact pass both the written and driving portions of her test? My husband would like the authorities to be the ones to give her the official news that she may not drive. But I am concerned that there is actually a good chance she might pass the test. What is our responsibility then, if an accident happens? Name Withheld As you describe it, the D.M.V. hasn’t specified that she fill out the paperwork herself; this isn’t part of the test. It’s perfectly appropriate, then, to assist her in scheduling the test, if she wants your assistance. The real issue is that you know she doesn’t belong behind the wheel. Find a way to tell her so, as a loving family member who’s worried about what might happen to her and to others if she continues driving. You can take the sting out of it by offering to make arrangements to help her get to where she needs to go. I don’t know how much longer she’ll be able to live on her own, but that’s bound to be a big concern for her at the moment. I recently had someone house-sit for me, and when I came back, I realized he left a controlled substance behind. I’m not sure if I should talk to him about it. We are friendly but not terribly close. I know him primarily through his sister — with whom I am very close. Part of my concern is that I know, from his sister, that he has a history of substance abuse; she shared with me a lot of the work it took to get him back on track. I’ve thought about talking with him directly, but I’m worried that we don’t have the right relationship to broach such a topic. Should I talk to his sister about it so that she can be aware of red flags? I love her dearly and saw how difficult it was on her to see her brother go through his past addiction. Or would that violate his privacy? Name Withheld, New York Does this house sitter and recovering addict have a reasonable expectation that you’ll keep from his sister evidence — which he left in your house — that he’s at risk of a recurrence? I don’t see that he does. Neither personal confidence nor professional privilege is at issue. What motivates you is a justified concern for his welfare. You’re not reporting him to the police or making his problem public. You would be discussing the matter with your dear friend, someone who may be in a position to provide her brother with needed support. In ways the philosopher Marilyn Friedman has explored, friends serve as “moral witnesses” to the experiences they relate to one another. Your friend has told you about what she went through with her brother, about her worries and her work. You’re thinking about how he might feel about your disclosing what you found; have you thought about how she would feel about your keeping her in the dark about it? Overcoming addiction can be an ongoing process, and people are more likely to succeed with the help of others."

The agreement in principle forms the basis for a final settlement of several lawsuits brought by First Nations groups against the Canadian government. Of the overall settlement, 40 billion in Canadian dollars, half will go toward compensating both children who were unnecessarily removed, and their families and caregivers, over the past three decades. The rest of the money will go toward repairing the child welfare system for First Nations children — who are statistically far more likely to be removed from their families — over the next five years to ensure families are able to stay together. “First Nations from across Canada have had to work very hard for this day to provide redress for monumental wrongs against First Nation children, wrongs fueled by an inherently biased system,” said Cindy Woodhouse, the Manitoba regional chief at the Assembly of First Nations, the largest Indigenous organization in Canada. “This wasn’t and isn’t about parenting. It’s in fact about poverty,” she said at a news conference, adding that more than 200,000 children and Indigenous families are affected by the agreement. The deal is an acknowledgment that the child welfare system was better resourced to remove children than to support them in place. The system was the product of discriminatory policies put in place and enforced over generations against Indigenous communities. Of those eligible for compensation, experts hired during the litigation have estimated that 115,000 children were separated from their families since 1991, said Robert Kugler, a lawyer who represented First Nations complainants on two different lawsuits, during the news conference. While less than 8 percent of children under 14 in Canada are Indigenous, they make up more than 52 percent of those in foster care, according to 2016 census data. The case was first brought to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal back in 2007, by the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, a child welfare advocacy group, and the country’s largest Indigenous organization, the Assembly of First Nations. They claimed First Nations children on reserves and in one northern territory were discriminated against, because the government didn’t fund their child welfare and family support services at the same rate as it did for non-Indigenous children. By 2004, reports showed there were three times the numbers of First Nations children in state care than during the height of residential schools, when Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their families. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, a quasi-judicial federal body that adjucates complaints of discrimination, concurred, and ruled in 2016 that the government must reform its child and family services programs for First Nations. This included changes to the formula used to calculate funding allocations for government services on reserves, according to the tribunal decision. But the federal government stalled, repeatedly appealing to have the case dismissed on technical grounds and failing to implement meaningful change. Over the past five years, the federal tribunal has issued around 20 noncompliance orders, according to one lawyer with the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society. In the meantime, other First Nations groups filed class action lawsuits against the government on similar grounds. “Canada could have settled this case for hundreds of millions of dollars back in 2000, when we raised the alarm that First Nations kids were getting 70 cents on the dollar compared to other kids,” said Cindy Blackstock, the executive director of the organization that initiated the case and a professor of social work at McGill University in Montreal. “But Canada chose not to do that,” Ms. Blackstock added. “And now we are into the tens of billions of dollars and most importantly, children have lost their lives and sometimes their childhoods in the process.” In November, the respected Indigenous judge and former senator Murray Sinclair was enlisted to help negotiate a settlement out of court. “This is the largest settlement in Canadian history,” said Marc Miller, Canada’s minister of crown-Indigenous relations, at a news conference in Ottawa on Tuesday. “But no amount of money can reverse the harms experienced by First Nations children.” The precise settlement terms for compensation and future child welfare reforms are still being negotiated, the government wrote in a statement, though funding to help youth who are aging out of the child care system will be distributed as early as the spring. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s political opponents criticized his government’s tactics in the child welfare lawsuit during last summer’s federal election campaign. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party, characterized the legal battle as Mr. Trudeau’s government “taking Indigenous kids to court.” Canada has been grappling with its colonial legacy since 2015, when the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission deemed that the historic removal of Indigenous children from their families over a century, when they were sent to residential schools, amounted to “cultural genocide.” The commission issued dozens of calls to action, the first of which was to reduce the number of Indigenous children in state care. Last year, the discoveries of hundreds of unmarked graves at the sites of two of those former schools added emotional urgency to the reckoning, including calls to abandon Canada Day celebrations. An estimated 150,000 Indigenous children attended the boarding schools, the last of which closed in 1996, where hundreds died. Many were physically and sexually abused. Tuesday’s settlement is the second multi-billion-dollar compensation agreement with Indigenous communities to be announced by the federal government in recent weeks. In December, the Federal Court of Canada approved a $6.3 billion lawsuit against the government over years of contaminated drinking water on Indigenous reserves."

Read more in a note from Times Opinion’s politics editor Ezekiel Kweku in our Opinion Today newsletter. The Jan. 6 attack would not have happened in a genuine democracy. The attack was the most acute symptom — so far — of the political crisis that Donald Trump incited by refusing to admit defeat in the 2020 election. But the roots of the crisis run deep into the undemocratic features of our constitutional system. The arcane scheme that Mr. Trump’s lawyers hatched to disrupt congressional certification of the vote and perhaps persuade Republican state legislatures to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in states like Pennsylvania was conceivable only because the Electoral College splinters presidential elections into separate contests in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia and skews the totals toward small states. In a simple system of majority rule, Mr. Biden’s thumping margin of more than seven million votes would have been the last word. For that matter, so would Hillary Clinton’s national margin of nearly three million votes in 2016: Mr. Trump would not have had a 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue address in which to barricade himself in 2020. Would Mr. Trump’s big lie about election fraud have sent the rioters to the Capitol anyway, even without his lawyers and fixers trying to overturn the results? Maybe. But there would have been no constitutional machinery to jam. And even the big lie received a huge constitutional assist. Thanks to the Electoral College, Mr. Trump could have tied Mr. Biden and forced the election into the House of Representatives by flipping just 43,000 votes in three close states, a gap narrow enough that any number of toxic fables can claim to bridge it. At a more basic level, today’s Republican Party succeeds only because the Electoral College, the Senate and the Supreme Court all tilt in its favor. That system has handed conservatives a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court, despite the fact that only one Republican has won the presidential popular vote after 1988. A party doesn’t have to persuade majorities that it has the best vision for the country. It only has to persuade a selective minority that the other side is a mortal threat. Its grasp on power may be too tenuous for the party to govern effectively, but it has offered conservatives a fine perch to weaken economic and environmental regulation, appoint conservative judges and launch attacks on the democratic system itself. In a more democratic system, the Republican Party’s extreme elements would have been sent packing long before they stormed the Capitol because they couldn’t muster enough votes to win a national election. Instead, they have perfected minority rule as a path to political success. An antidemocratic system has bred an antidemocratic party. The remedy is to democratize our so-called democracy. James Madison boasted that the Constitution achieved “the total exclusion of the people, in their collective capacity.” Its elaborate political mechanics reflect the elite dislike and mistrust of majority rule that Madison voiced when he wrote, “Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob.” Madison’s condescension has never gone away. Walter Lippmann, perhaps the most prominent intellectual of the short American Century, reckoned that citizens were ignorant, confused and emotional. Democracy brought “an intensification of feeling and a degradation of significance” to whatever it touched. If Madison and Lippmann could have seen the “QAnon Shaman” break into the Capitol, then meander around like a tourist whose phone has lost its signal, they would have muttered, “This is what democracy looks like.” Democracy receded from the popular imagination during the blandly optimistic decades that followed the Cold War’s end around 1989. American leaders predicted that the world would inevitably come to embrace some combination of elections, capitalism and personal freedom. Serious thinking about what democracy meant, and what could threaten it, seemed more like intellectual history than practical politics. We live in the shipwreck of that unearned optimism. Jan. 6 and the four years before it were a forcible reminder that democracy is a task, not a birthright. Having rediscovered that we must take democracy seriously, we should now put it first in our politics. Majorities of the people, not the Electoral College, should be able to pick the president and decide who controls the House and Senate. All who make their lives in the United States — including the incarcerated, people convicted of felonies and noncitizens — should be allowed to vote. This might sound alarming to inland Republican voters who imagine themselves besieged by a permanent coastal majority. But in a working democracy, there are no permanent majorities or minorities. Forging partnerships in a truly democratic system, inland conservatives would soon find new allies — just not ones determined to break democracy itself. Some of these changes probably require amending the Constitution. Hard changes have come through constitutional amendment before: Shortly before World War I, activists successfully pressed state legislatures to ratify an amendment giving up their power to choose U.S. senators. Maybe we can revive mass movements for amendments, starting with one that would make the amendment process itself more democratic. If the public supports a constitutional amendment to limit money in politics, restrict gerrymandering or enshrine a core abortion right, a committed majority should be able to say what our fundamental law is by popular vote, rather than having to go through the current, complicated process of ratifying amendments through state legislatures or dozens of constitutional conventions. This may sound wild-eyed. But it would not always have. James Wilson, one of the most learned and thoughtful of the Constitution’s framers, believed that as a matter of principle, “the people” may change the Constitution “whenever and however they please. This is a right of which no positive institution can ever deprive them.” Even Madison conceded that if we thought of the Constitution as a national charter rather than a federal arrangement among sovereign states, “the supreme and ultimate authority” would reside with the majority, which had the power to “alter or abolish its established government.” It is hard to deny that, since 1789, the Constitution has become a national charter in the minds of most Americans. Do we really think that establishing fundamental law is too much for us, something only revered (or reviled) ancestors could do? More likely we are afraid of one another and the decisions majorities would make. Thinkers like Madison associated democracy with majority tyranny, but history tells a different story. Even our terribly flawed legacy is rich in examples of majoritarian emancipation: New Deal programs, the Civil Rights Acts and the Voting Rights Act and Medicare. Majorities can change the world for the better, when they have the chance. Giving one another that chance, over and over, is how equals share a country. But are we willing to give, and take, that chance? Maybe more than fearing majority tyranny, we suspect that the country is already too divided and mistrustful to make basic choices together at all. One thing Democrats and Republicans share is the belief that, to save the country, the other side must not be allowed to win. Every election is an existential crisis. In our current political climate, any proposal to democratize the system would immediately be coded as partisan, and half the country would reject it from the start. In such an anxious and suspicious country, the current system can be seen as a kind of peace treaty. Maybe that was what Mr. Biden meant when, just after taking his oath of office two weeks after the Capitol riot, in a Washington guarded by 26,000 troops, he praised “the resilience of our Constitution.” But the Constitution is not keeping the peace; it is fostering crises. Far from being resilient, it is adding to our brittleness. Resilience would come from a shift to more constructive politics. Majorities should be able to choose parties and leaders to improve their everyday lives, starting with child care, family leave, health care and the dignified work that still evades many even at a time when employers are complaining of difficulty hiring workers and there is upward pressure on wages after decades of stagnation. Democracy matters not because there is something magical about 50-percent-plus-one in any given vote but because it gives people the power to decide how they will live together. If we don’t claim that power, the market, a court or a minority government will always be pleased to take it off our hands. Aristotle called democracy “the rule of the poor,” and he was onto something. Democracy, when it works, puts the ultimate political power in the hands of the people who work, worry and wish they could promise their loved ones more than they can. It gives us back a bit of our world. Of course, we must not make the perfect the enemy of the good. Our Constitution deserves to be defended against lies about election fraud and antidemocratic schemes to double down on minority rule. But it also deserves cleareyed efforts to make it better. If Jan. 6 was a symptom of a crisis of democracy, the best answer we can give is more democracy. We might not be capable of that, in which case the future is bleak. But the only way to find out is by trying. Democracy’s vitality is not handed down from on high. It comes from actually ruling and being ruled in turn and learning to live with both. It comes from the constant search for new majorities, new coalitions, new ways to avoid disaster and even make life better. That is how we learn to believe, with Walt Whitman, that “every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.” The way to save democracy is to make it more real."
117,The New York Times,nytimes,"Women who received Covid vaccines while pregnant were at no greater risk of delivering their babies prematurely or of giving birth to unusually small babies than pregnant women who did not get vaccinated, a new study reports.",https://nyti.ms/3mWdJJy?fbclid=IwAR12TqbaTI52AVGjXuhhRbiI8jMHWZulsXhM2aoHK1Acj2OxRzXBvUeR3IA,2d,"Public school officials in Chicago canceled classes for Wednesday amid a clash with the teachers’ union, whose members had threatened to stay home in a bid to force instruction online during a coronavirus surge. Union members had criticized the district’s response to the Omicron variant, which has pushed cases in the city to record levels, and said conditions in classrooms were unsafe. The Chicago Teachers Union said late Tuesday night that 73 percent of members who voted favored pausing in-person instruction. But Mayor Lori Lightfoot said reverting to online schooling was unacceptable and unnecessary, and her administration decided to call off class altogether — keeping the buildings open for emergency child care — rather than return to virtual instruction. “Nobody signs up for being a home-schooler at the last minute,” Ms. Lightfoot said. “We can’t forget about how disruptive that remote process is to individual parents who have to work, who can’t afford the luxury of staying home.” Ms. Lightfoot, a Democrat, urged teachers to report to work and suggested they were considering an illegal work stoppage. As highly contagious Omicron rears its head, so do debates that were considered settled. After a relatively calm fall, when school administrators, unions and families largely agreed that remote schooling was a nonstarter, the brinkmanship between the third-largest U.S. district and its union exposes just how quickly that political consensus can fall away. Like other school systems, Chicago has had to confront a shortage of tests, and a far from universal vaccination rate among students. There have been large numbers of staff members calling in sick, and widespread anxiety among just about everyone. Other districts, including in Cleveland, Milwaukee and Atlanta, have also gone online temporarily, but without a public labor dispute. The ongoing chaos has unnerved parents who are desperate for some kind of stability. Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Chicago to their highest rate since the pandemic began. But as in the rest of the country, vaccinated adults have had lower rates of hospitalization and death, while children of all ages — regardless of vaccination status — have overwhelmingly been spared severe outcomes. In addition, data from Chicago and elsewhere shows that in-school transmission of the coronavirus has been limited, with a majority of teacher and student cases originating outside school buildings. More than 90 percent of Chicago Public Schools employees are fully vaccinated. Still, members of the powerful Chicago Teachers Union have accused the school district of failing to adjust to Omicron, and the growing threat of breakthrough infections. During the holiday break, they had asked for either universal P.C.R. testing of students and staff or a two-week transition to remote learning. “We are between a rock and a hard place — the rock being the pandemic, the hard place being an intractable, incompetent mayor,” Stacy Davis Gates, the union’s vice president, said this week. She added, “We said a two-week pause so they could get themselves together, have the proper communication, put in the necessary mitigations.” Despite sharp criticism, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday stood by its recommendation that Americans infected with the coronavirus end their isolation after five days without first obtaining a negative virus test. The agency guidelines, released last week, shortened the recommended isolation period from 10 days to five for infected people who do not have symptoms, or whose symptoms are resolving. But the agency did not recommend testing before leaving isolation, an omission that surprised and worried many outside experts. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director, told The New York Times last week that the recommendation was based on evidence showing that the vast majority of transmissibility happens in the two days before symptoms and the two to three days after onset. The guidelines suggested that following isolation, recovered people wear a mask around others for another five days. Dr. Walensky defended the decision to omit testing, saying that rapid tests are not reliable for determining when an individual is no longer contagious. The Food and Drug Administration also said last week that rapid tests might be less reliable at picking up Omicron, compared with infections caused by previous variants. But the agency declined to elaborate on the basis for that assertion. Many public health experts said ending isolation at five days was risky, and that the agency should at least urge people to test negative before mingling with others. They also derided the agency for what some saw as a capitulation to pressure from corporations buckling under staff shortages during the Omicron surge. Responding to some of the criticisms, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top coronavirus adviser, said on Sunday that the C.D.C. was considering adding testing to its recommendations, and would clarify the guidance within days. The agency was widely expected to add testing to its guidance as early as Tuesday. But in a surprising move, officials updated the C.D.C. website without a testing requirement. The agency on Tuesday also provided scientific rationale for shortening the isolation period. The guidelines now say that an individual who “has access to a test and wants to test” at the end of the isolation period may do so, but stops short of a recommendation to test. The new guidelines “facilitate individual social and well-being needs, return to work, and maintenance of critical infrastructure,” according to an update posted on Tuesday to the agency’s website. For people exposed to the virus who are unvaccinated or have not yet received a booster dose of one of the vaccines, the agency now recommends a quarantine of five days, followed by strict mask use for another five. People who have received a booster shot do not need to quarantine following an exposure, but should wear a mask for 10 days afterward, according to the guidelines. Women who received Covid vaccinations while pregnant were at no greater risk of delivering their babies prematurely or of giving birth to unusually small babies than pregnant women who did not get vaccinated, a new study reports. The study, one of the first to examine the health of babies born to women vaccinated during pregnancy, was a reassuring signal. Low-birth-weight babies and infants born early are more likely to experience developmental delays and other health problems. An earlier study had found that women vaccinated during pregnancy did not face a higher risk of miscarriage than the unvaccinated. The new study looked at some 46,079 singleton pregnancies that resulted in a live birth, including some 10,064 among women who received one or more doses of Covid vaccine between Dec. 15, 2020, and July 22, 2021, during their pregnancies. Most had received the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, and the vast majority were inoculated during their second or third trimester. Overall, 6.6 percent of the babies were born prematurely, before 37 weeks of pregnancy, and 8.2 percent were born small for their gestational age, weighing less than 5 pounds and 8 ounces. Researchers found no difference in the rates among mothers who had been vaccinated while pregnant and those who had not. “We plan to do follow-up studies on infants and their development, but there hasn’t been enough time to do them yet,” said Dr. Heather S. Lipkind, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at Yale University and lead author on the new research. The study was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in collaboration with Dr. Lipkind, HealthPartners Institute, Kaiser Permanente researchers and the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute.  The risks of pre-term birth, which appear to be higher when pregnant women are infected with the coronavirus, are well established, she said: “With each week of gestation, the brain develops more. If you have Covid and have to deliver preterm, that can also affect long-term development.” Another benefit to vaccination is that women may pass on coronavirus antibodies to their infants, helping to protect them from illness, Dr. Lipkind added. Pregnant women who become infected face a higher risk of developing severe disease, and federal health officials have implored them to get vaccinated. Nevertheless, vaccination rates remain low among pregnant women — about 31 percent as of late September. Vaccination rates also vary widely by community. While almost half of all pregnant Asian Americans are vaccinated, only 25 percent of pregnant Hispanic women are, and only 15 percent of pregnant Black women, according to the C.D.C. “I can tell you, anecdotally, that in my practice women who are not vaccinated are for sure getting way sicker,” Dr. Lipkind said, “and we’re seeing pre-term birth in pregnant women who had Covid and loss of pregnancy. It’s very, very tragic.” She strongly encourages her patients to get vaccinated, especially now that the highly contagious Omicron variant is circulating. But she often faces fierce resistance, she said. “I think people are just afraid of the unknown in general with pregnancy,” Dr. Lipkind said. “This new research should make people feel a little better about vaccination.” The governor of Maryland declared a 30-day state of emergency on Tuesday and mobilized 1,000 members of the National Guard in response to a surge in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. Gov. Larry Hogan wrote on Twitter that the actions were needed “to combat the current COVID-19 surge.” The emergency order also allows the state’s health secretary to “regulate hospital personnel, bed space, and supplies,” Mr. Hogan said on Twitter. In Maryland, 70 percent of residents are fully vaccinated, including 80 percent of people age 12 and older, according to a New York Times database. But officials have been bracing for what they said may be one of the worst waves of the pandemic. The daily average of coronavirus cases has soared by more than 700 percent over the past two weeks, according to The Times’ database. Nationally, the spike has been no less staggering. The United States is averaging more than 547,600 cases daily, a record and a 254 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are rising more slowly, up 43 percent in the past two weeks, and a smaller proportion of patients are landing in intensive care units or requiring mechanical ventilation, compared with those in previous waves. Deaths are down by 3 percent. Despite having one of the highest vaccination rates in the nation, hospitals were filled with unvaccinated patients, Mr. Hogan said Sunday on the CNN program “State of the Union.” “We’re going to take and continue to take every action we possibly can to help our hospitals, our nursing homes and to keep people safe,” he said. It’s unclear how many hospitalizations are patients infected with Omicron versus the Delta variant, which is thought to be significantly more virulent. According to the C.D.C., about 58 percent of cases in Maryland and nearby states are currently Omicron. The Maryland Hospital Association said that the number of hospital patients surpassed the state’s Covid peak from last winter. A lawsuit filed by Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas on Tuesday challenging the Biden administration’s military vaccine mandate revealed that thousands of members of the Texas Army National Guard had refused to receive Covid vaccinations. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern Division of Texas, seeks to prevent unvaccinated National Guard members from being penalized or discharged. It comes as Mr. Abbott has called up thousands of members of the Texas Military Department, which includes the National Guard, to join in border security operations. The filing notes that about 40 percent of the state’s Army National Guard have not been vaccinated “for either religious accommodation needs or otherwise.” No indication of the size of that force is evident on the Texas Army National Guard’s website, but Stars & Stripes, the newspaper of the U.S. armed forces, said that a 2018 Texas Military Department report put the number at about 18,160. Forty percent of that would be more than 7,000 people. The suit indicated that less than 10 percent of the Texas Air National Guard were unvaccinated. It said that “more than 220” members had declined to be vaccinated in a force that the 2018 report put at more than 3,000. Mr. Abbott, who is facing reelection this year, has barred mask and vaccine mandates within Texas and has mounted a strong fight against federal mandates. The state lags the national average in Covid vaccinations, with about 57 percent of the population fully vaccinated, and its Covid hospitalizations have risen 87 percent over the past two weeks as cases have exploded there, according to a New York Times database. The suit was the latest effort by a Republican-led state government to prevent the federal mandate for their National Guards, arguing that it impinges on their command over state troops. In mid-December, the governors of Alaska, Wyoming, Iowa, Mississippi and Nebraska — all Republicans — asked the defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, for exemptions. At the end of December, a federal judge rejected a legal challenge to the federal mandate filed by the governor of Oklahoma, Kevin Stitt, also a Republican. Mr. Austin, who was also named in Mr. Abbott’s suit, has repeatedly affirmed that the mandate applies to the National Guard. On Sunday, after he announced on Twitter that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, he added that the vaccination would “remain a military medical requirement for our workforce,” which he said “remains a readiness issue.” In a letter on Tuesday to Maj. Gen. Tracy R. Norris, the commander of the Texas Military Department, Mr. Abbott described his intent to fight the federal mandate, but also forecast possible defeat. “I cannot guarantee that the judiciary will grant the relief you deserve,” he wrote, adding, “Win or lose, President Biden must be held accountable for his unconscionable willingness to hollow out the Texas National Guard. Please know that I am grateful for your service and will continue fighting on your behalf.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain on Tuesday said that despite the record surge in coronavirus cases, the limited restrictions currently in place in England were the right approach and would be maintained. “We have a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country once again,” Mr. Johnson said at an evening news conference, adding, “We can keep our schools and businesses open, and we can find a way to live with this virus.” The prime minister said he would urge the cabinet to carry on with the current coronavirus contingency measures, called “Plan B,” which were introduced in early December as the Omicron wave took hold. They include masking mandates, guidance to work from home and the use of vaccine passports, but they fall short of the stricter lockdown measures some opposition lawmakers and scientists had called for. “I do think the balance of measures that we have is the right one,” Mr. Johnson said. He said he believed there was a “good chance” of getting through the wave without further restrictions. As Mr. Johnson’s government has pushed for the Britain to remain open in recent weeks, a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant has added to the pressure to shut down. On Tuesday, some 218,000 new coronavirus cases were reported, and hospitalizations have continued to rise. Absences at hospitals across England have left a number of facilities critically short of staff, field hospitals have been set up to deal with an overflow of patients, and public transportation has been hit with shutdowns as workers have called in sick. Mr. Johnson acknowledged that the weeks ahead would be challenging. But he pointed to support being given to key industries and said he believed the staff shortages would be far less disruptive than a lockdown. He said the government had identified 100,000 critical workers who would be offered daily virus tests to help keep essential services open. Schools in England reopened on Tuesday with new measures, including extended masking requirements and testing. Recently retired teachers were being asked to return to cover absences. And as England’s National Health Service moved to a “war footing,” the government was working to identify hospitals most likely to need military support. Despite the rise in cases, there were some glimmers of good news. England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said on Tuesday that new data showed that a booster shot gave a person around 88 percent protection against hospitalization, and that protection was likely to be even greater when it came to mortality. Earlier in the day, Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, said that he was “cautiously optimistic” that coronavirus infection rates in London in the key 18-to-50 age group that has been driving the Omicron outbreak “may possibly have plateaued.” Professor Ferguson told the BBC that it was too early to say whether new infections were going down, but the growth in some areas had slowed. He cautioned, however, that it could be weeks before the full effect of social mixing over Christmas was known. Holiday socializing may prove especially risky for older populations, he said. “Hospitalizations are still generally going up across the country, and we may see high levels for some weeks,” Professor Ferguson said, adding that the numbers were still far below levels seen during a peak last year. WASHINGTON — The United States government doubled its order for Pfizer’s Covid pills on Tuesday, a move that will modestly increase the nation’s very limited supply of the treatment in the short term amid a record-setting surge in coronavirus cases. The new order will eventually provide enough pills for an additional 10 million Americans, bringing the government’s total order of the drug to 20 million treatment courses. But they will not all be available right away. Only 35,000 of the additional courses will be delivered this month, and 50,000 more in February, supplementing 350,000 treatment courses that were already expected over the next two months, according to a senior administration official. The order underscored how urgently health providers need alternatives to vaccines, as roughly 35 million adults remain without a shot and more vulnerable to severe outcomes from Covid. Tens of millions more have been vaccinated but have risk factors that also make them especially vulnerable. The new order also suggests that the federal pandemic response will increasingly rely on oral treatments, which are scarce and facing intense demand. “We may need even more,” President Biden said on Tuesday, announcing the move ahead of a Covid briefing he was set to receive from health advisers. “That’s the estimate we need right now.” The government has agreed to pay Pfizer $530 for each treatment course, the same amount it paid for its initial order late last year, the senior official said. Monthly deliveries of the Pfizer treatment, known as Paxlovid, are not expected to ramp up into the millions until April, too late to help with the current surge. The combined order is not due to be completely filled until the end of September. Still, Mr. Biden described the doubled order as a key component of the federal government’s Covid strategy. “They’re a game-changer,” he said, “and have the potential to dramatically alter” the course of the pandemic. Paxlovid was authorized two weeks ago for use in high-risk Covid patients age 12 or older. Pfizer expects to produce 120 million courses of it in 2022 for all global buyers. The treatment has proved in clinical trials to be highly effective in staving off severe illness when taken soon after the start of symptoms. Pfizer’s treatment is meant to be taken as 30 pills over five days, with patients taking three pills at a time: two of Pfizer’s pills and one of a low-dose H.I.V. drug known as ritonavir, which helps Pfizer’s drug remain active in the body longer. But public health experts have warned that without an adequate testing supply — a problem in many parts of the country — it could be difficult to quickly get the pills to those most in need. A mother in rural Wisconsin said she felt “utterly helpless” as she sent her 13-year-old off to school. Another, in suburban New Jersey, expressed frustration that her highly vaccinated district hadn’t loosened quarantine requirements. One in Chicago said she hoped the city’s teachers followed through on their threat to walk out so her 12-year-old daughter wouldn’t have to return to a crowded classroom. This is parenthood nearly two years into the pandemic, as schools reopen after the holidays. Or don’t. Or do halfway, or open and close again, or — they’re not sure. They’ll let you know tomorrow. The New York Times asked parents to share how they were handling their schools’ approaches. Hundreds responded, almost all of them mothers. Their answers varied widely in specifics but mostly boiled down to: Not well. “I am screaming inside,” wrote Cathy Nieng, the Chicago mother. “I cry a lot,” said Juliana Gamble, whose children — ages 2 and 7 — have been in school and day care in Boston for just 11 days in the past eight weeks. “I feel a total loss of control of my life.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended on Tuesday that Americans who received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine seek a booster shot five months after the second shot, and not wait six months, as earlier guidance had said. The agency also recommended that some immunocompromised children ages 5 to 11 receive an additional primary vaccine shot 28 days after the second shot, matching the guidance for similar people 12 and older. Pfizer’s vaccine is the only one authorized for pediatric use in the United States. The endorsements come on the heels of the authorization of the same steps by the Food and Drug Administration on Monday. The F.D.A. also cleared 12- to 15-year-olds to receive boosters of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The C.D.C.’s vaccine advisory committee is set to meet Wednesday to discuss whether to recommend that step. The C.D.C. and the F.D.A. share responsibility for setting the nation’s vaccine policy, and have worked to present a unified front in their reviews of booster shots. If the advisory committee does follow the F.D.A.’s lead, the C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, is expected to quickly sign off on the recommendation. The moves come at a time when the fast-spreading Omicron variant is infecting record numbers of Americans each day, and many hospitals in the United States are already deluged with Covid-19 patients with the earlier Delta variant. Federal guidance has not changed for when to seek booster shots after initially receiving the Moderna vaccine (6 months after the second shot) or the Johnson & Johnson vaccine (2 months after the single shot). More than 70 percent of people in the United States who are 12 or older have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C. In total, at least 1.9 million adolescents between 12 and 15 have tested positive for the virus, according to the C.D.C. Children who get infected with the coronavirus are less likely to develop serious illness than adults are, but they can still become very sick and even die. The F.D.A. noted that data from Israel showed no serious safety concerns in thousands of 12- to 15-year-olds who received a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine. There were no reports of myocarditis, a very rare side effect linked to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that has been seen mostly in younger men. The condition involves inflammation of muscle tissue in the heart. Macy’s began requesting the vaccination statuses of employees on Tuesday, a sign it was preparing for a potential mandate of vaccinations or weekly testing ahead of a special Supreme Court hearing about such rules on Friday. In a memo sent to employees that was obtained by The New York Times, the retailer — which also owns Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury — told workers in the United States to upload their vaccination statuses to a third-party platform by Jan. 16 “regardless of whether you work in a store, a supply chain facility, an office, or are remote/hybrid.” For employees who say they are unvaccinated, Macy’s said it would “review your submission and you may be contacted by someone from the Colleague Advisory team to discuss next steps.” The company also said it might require proof of negative tests to be uploaded to the same system starting on Feb. 16. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hold the hearing this week to assess the legality of two measures from the Biden administration: a vaccine-or-testing mandate aimed at large employers and a vaccination requirement for certain health care workers. The retail industry had pushed back on a new rule issued in November by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requiring companies with 100 or more workers to mandate vaccines or weekly tests, saying it could intensify a labor shortage that many retailers were dealing with during the busy holiday season. Since then, the Omicron variant has sent global coronavirus cases to record levels, though recent data shows that people infected with it are far less likely to be hospitalized than those infected with the Delta variant, especially if they are vaccinated. Macy’s said separately on Tuesday that it planned to shorten store hours from Monday through Thursday for the rest of January amid the spike and staffing shortages. The news was reported earlier by CNBC. The National Retail Federation, a major industry lobbying group, said in a statement on Tuesday that it “continues to believe that OSHA exceeded its authority in promulgating its vaccine mandate, and we look forward to making that argument before the Supreme Court on Friday.” The group estimated that the order would require 20 million tests a week nationally, based on external data on unvaccinated workers, and that “such testing capacity currently does not exist.” Still, the memo from Macy’s, which has tens of thousands of employees, suggests that the industry is preparing to carry out the rule. Macy’s also said in its memo that it would adopt the new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that recommended shortening isolation periods for infected people to five days from 10 if they are asymptomatic or their symptoms are resolving. The retailer asked in the fall that its corporate staff either be vaccinated or test negative for Covid-19 before returning to the office, but it did not make the same request of store employees. When asked about the memo, a Macy’s representative said in an email that the retailer was “working to comply with federal and local guidelines related to Covid.” Seth Meyers, the host of NBC’s “Late Night,” said Tuesday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus and that tapings of his program would be canceled through the end of the week. In a tweet posted Tuesday morning, Mr. Meyers wrote, “The bad news is, I tested positive for COVID (thanks, 2022!) the good news is, I feel fine (thanks vaccines and booster!)” He indicated that “Late Night” would probably return in a remote format next week, asking viewers to “tune in next Monday to see what cool location we will try and pass off as a studio!!!” Mr. Meyers, a “Saturday Night Live” alumnus, had just returned to “Late Night” on Monday after a holiday break, in a broadcast that featured a live studio audience and guests (including the musician David Byrne and cast members from the NBC drama “This Is Us”) who appeared in remote interviews. “Late Night” is one of several NBC programs produced at the network’s flagship New York headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, along with “S.N.L.” and “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.” Mr. Fallon, the “Tonight Show” host, said that he had tested positive for the virus over the holidays and that he experienced “mild symptoms” while his program was on a scheduled break. He returned to host “Tonight” on Monday. The final “S.N.L.” broadcast of 2021, which was shown on Dec. 18, was also significantly disrupted by the emergence of the Omicron variant. It aired without a live audience or a musical guest, and with most of its regular cast members absent. In his first big test as mayor of New York City, Eric Adams is resisting pressure from municipal unions and elected officials to do more to stop the spread of the coronavirus as cases and hospitalizations are surging. Mr. Adams is holding firm that schools must stay open, and he is urging employers to have employees return to their offices, despite calls from some union leaders to temporarily return to virtual learning and remote work. With coronavirus cases rising rapidly in recent days, a small but growing list of public school districts around the country — including Newark, Atlanta, Milwaukee and Cleveland — have moved temporarily to remote learning. On Monday night, Philadelphia’s school district announced that 81 schools, out of 216, would go remote.  In an interview on CNN on Tuesday morning, Mr. Adams defended his decision to reopen schools, even though roughly a third of parents did not send their children back to classrooms on Monday for the start of the semester. He continued to argue that students were safer at school. “I’m not going to allow the hysteria to prevent the future of my children receiving a quality education,” Mr. Adams said on CNN. On Tuesday, President Biden, citing the lack of evidence that Omicron more severely impacts children, called for schools to remain open in the United States. Local officials should use federal funds from the stimulus package passed last year to improve ventilation systems in schools and support classrooms large enough for social distancing, he said. “We have no reason to think at this point that Omicron is worse for children than previous variants,” Mr. Biden said. “We know that our kids can be safe when in school.” Mr. Adams, a Democrat who was sworn in on Saturday just after the New Year’s Eve ball dropped in Times Square, also urged companies not to allow employees to work remotely, echoing a message he conveyed Monday on Bloomberg TV: “You can’t run New York City from home.” Mr. Adams insisted on Tuesday that he was not at war with the teachers’ union and its president, Michael Mulgrew, who had called for a temporary return to remote learning. “There’s no battle between Michael Mulgrew and Eric Adams,” Mr. Adams said, adding that they speak three times a day and were working together to keep classrooms safe. Mr. Adams has repeatedly argued that city schools must stay open and that poor children in particular suffered from remote learning. He recently announced, alongside his predecessor and the governor, a plan to distribute millions of rapid at-home tests to schools and increase random surveillance testing among students. New York City reported nearly 30,000 new virus cases on Monday, and the number of people hospitalized has surpassed 5,000, according to state data. That level exceeds last winter’s peak, but is still below the hospitalization rate during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, when 12,000 people were hospitalized on the worst days. There are long lines outside testing centers, as has been the case for weeks, and many private companies have said their employees should continue to work from home. Some public officials have called for more aggressive measures to stop the spread of the virus, including Mark D. Levine, the new Manhattan borough president who has become a leading voice in amplifying the views of health experts. Mr. Levine released a 16-point plan on Monday that called on the city to encourage New Yorkers to avoid large gatherings, to temporarily allow city employees to work from home and to require masks at all indoor settings for vaccinated and unvaccinated New Yorkers. “We need to act now to slow this wave, protect our hospitals, and support the sick,” he said. His plan has received support from leaders including Randi Weingarten, the head of the country’s most powerful teachers union, and Ron T. Kim, a state assemblyman from Queens. In September, then-Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered city employees who had been working from home to return to offices. The city has more than 300,000 workers, and about 80,000 of those who work in offices and had been allowed to work remotely were required to return. As coronavirus cases began to soar in December, the largest union representing city workers called on Mr. de Blasio to implement a remote policy for employees who are able to do their jobs from home. On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the union, District Council 37, said it would continue to push Mr. Adams for a remote policy. “Our nonessential members have proven they can do their jobs from home,” the spokeswoman, Freddi Goldstein, said. “There’s no reason to keep them in the office risking their health.” Mr. Adams, who is close with District Council 37 leaders, has said that he would discuss the policy with unions. As New York State all but ran out of its share of a federal pandemic rent relief program in the fall, state officials asked the federal government for $1 billion more — money they said was necessary to keep tens of thousands of struggling residents out of debt and in their homes. But the state has now received some sobering news: it stands to receive about $27 million, less than 3 percent of what it requested. The gap between the need outlined by the state and the money it is getting is yet another stark illustration of just how severe the economic crisis has been in New York and elsewhere. State and federal officials said the need was high in places all around the country and there is only a limited pot of funds overall.  But without more aid, tens of thousands of renters who lost their jobs in the pandemic will not be able to cover their debts and could be at greater risk of eviction when a moratorium expires in less than two weeks. Landlords also will not be able to make up the lost rental income. “If we can’t make up that shortfall, it’s going to mean that many tenants and their landlords are going to continue to struggle with the consequences of the decisions the government made in response to Covid,” said Brian Kavanaugh, a Democrat who sponsored the bill that created New York’s rent relief program and who is chair of the State Senate’s housing committee. The funds are part of a more than $46 billion federal program, set up by Congress through two stimulus bills passed in 2020 and 2021, which is distributing aid across the nation. New York’s share was about $2.4 billion, but by the fall, nearly all of the state’s money was either paid out or spoken for, state officials had said. New York then stopped taking most new applications. There was a chance the state could have still received more. Under the law, places that had not used much of their money could see their funds reallocated to other states with greater need. A county in Texas, for example, voted in November to return some $7 million to the federal government. But in an email sent to the state on Thursday, an official with the Treasury Department said that “the amount of reallocated funds requested” by states like New York and other localities was “far greater than the funding available to distribute.” The Treasury Department did not answer questions about how New York’s share was determined or how much other states may have received. But a spokeswoman for the department said that more money would be redistributed in the future. The amount New York is receiving in additional rent relief was reported by Law 360 on Tuesday based on information included in a court document written by Barbara C. Guinn, the executive deputy commissioner of the office of temporary and disability assistance, the state agency that is administering New York’s rent relief program. That document was filed on Monday in a lawsuit filed by some renters and housing groups over the state’s decision to stop taking applications for rent relief. A spokesman for Gov. Kathy Hochul said the state was “disappointed” in the amount it was slated to receive, but said the state would “continue pursuing all avenues to secure federal funding that keeps New Yorkers in their homes.” The International Polar Foundation confirmed on Tuesday that 11 workers at a research station in Antarctica had tested positive for the coronavirus last month despite testing and quarantine requirements for new arrivals. All of the infected workers — eight of whom are still in Antarctica, and three of whom left on a scheduled Dec. 23 flight — were vaccinated and have recovered, according to the foundation, which is based in Belgium and operates that country’s Princess Elisabeth Station Antarctica research facility. (The facility is named for a member of the Belgian royal family.) The outbreak is not the first among the dozens of research stations scattered around Antarctica; 36 people stationed at a Chilean research base there tested positive in December 2020. But it underscores the ruthlessness with which the virus is spreading, even in the most remote places and among the most vaccinated populations. There are now 30 people stationed at the Princess Elisabeth facility, which is about 2,600 miles south of Cape Town. In addition, four scientists are conducting “remote field work,” according to the foundation. Some news outlets have reported that 16 people tested positive, a number the foundation said was inaccurate. It also pushed back against reports that it had “suspended” flights to and from the station until Jan. 12, saying that no flights had been scheduled between Dec. 23 and Jan. 12 in the first place. “The management at the Princess Elisabeth Antarctica offered anyone who so wished the opportunity to leave on a scheduled flight on Jan. 12,” the foundation said in its statement on Tuesday. “However, all who were on longer missions expressed their wish to stay and continue their work. In addition, a new team of scientists will arrive at the station on Jan. 12 as planned. They were also informed of the outbreak and given the opportunity to cancel, which they refused.” Workers at the station are all vaccinated, but only one has received a booster shot. New arrivals are required to take a P.C.R. test within 72 hours of flying to Cape Town; to quarantine for five days; to take another P.C.R. test within 48 hours of flying from Cape Town to Antarctica; and to take a final test five days after arriving at the Princess Elisabeth Station. According to the foundation, a group arrived in Antarctica on Dec. 9, and all members tested negative on Dec. 14. The first infection was detected on Dec. 15. The foundation said medical staff had “isolated all residents of the station who presented symptoms to such a level that there was a risk of further contamination for others” — leaving it unclear whether asymptomatic workers had been required to isolate, and what criteria were used to determine who posed a risk. An infected person can transmit the virus even if they have no symptoms. JERUSALEM — Fourth shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine produce a fivefold increase in antibodies in recipients’ blood, according to preliminary study results announced on Tuesday by an Israeli hospital. The small, pioneering research study, underway for a week, is meant to test the safety and effectiveness of giving yet another shot of the vaccine to people who have already received a booster dose. Still, there remains debate over whether fourth shots are advisable, as research indicates that Covid vaccines already protect against the worst outcomes, including from the Omicron variant. Any booster is likely to raise the number of antibodies in the short term; the question remains how long the effect will last because antibodies inevitably decline over time. Officials at the hospital — Sheba Medical Center, near Tel Aviv — said the increase in antibodies, which are the body’s frontline defense against infection but are just one of the many parts of the human immune system, could provide protection against infection, with the Omicron variant now surging across much of the world. The study involved administering an additional shot to 150 generally healthy medical workers who had received a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least four months ago, and whose antibody count in blood tests had dropped below levels considered sufficient to protect against infection, according to a spokesman for Sheba. Israel is facing a surge in coronavirus cases, driven by the Omicron variant. In an effort to protect the most vulnerable parts of the population, Israel has already begun offering fourth vaccine doses to people 60 and over, to people with weakened immune systems, and to medical and nursing home workers. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, a strong supporter of fourth shots, visited Sheba Medical Center on Tuesday and was the first to announce the preliminary results of the study. “The fourth vaccine, to a very high degree of probability, works,” he said. Prof. Gili Regev Yochay, the director of the infectious disease epidemiology unit at Sheba and the leader of the study, said it would yield more information in the coming days and weeks. Israel was a leader in introducing the first round of Covid vaccinations and later in giving booster shots, putting it in a position to make early assessments of how effective the shots are and how quickly protection wears off. A panel of medical experts advising the Israeli government recommended last month that the country start offering fourth doses, pointing to evidence of decreased protection against infection in people who were among the first to receive a third dose in August. Israeli data showed that among people 60 and over, the rate of infection from the Delta variant doubled once four or five months had elapsed since they received booster shots. But there was no immediate evidence of decreased effectiveness against serious illness. Health officials took some time to consider the fourth-shot recommendation, saying they were still gathering data about Omicron from abroad. Some experts asked whether the recommendation was premature, given the lack of data. The Ministry of Health acted first to approve fourth doses for people with weakened immune systems, and then for the residents and staff of nursing homes. The ministry expanded eligibility on Sunday to everyone 60 and over, without presenting any new data to back the decision. The decision was based on a rapid rise in infections in Israel and an assessment of the risk of increased serious illness, the ministry said, arguing that there was no time to wait for additional data. But officials were at least convinced that a fourth dose was safe. Sheba officials said on Sunday that side effects experienced by people who received a fourth dose as part of the study were similar to those felt after third doses: mainly mild reactions at the injection site, with a few temporary fevers or headaches. The president of Mozambique and his wife have tested positive for Covid-19 and are in isolation, the government said on Monday. The president, Filipe Nyusi, 62, and his wife, Isaura, 59, took rapid tests and did not have symptoms, according to a statement released by his office. The couple decided to isolate while awaiting results from P.C.R. tests, which were to be completed in a lab, the statement said. Mr. Nyusi is the latest of several heads of state in southern Africa to test positive in recent weeks, among them President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and President Hage Geingob of Namibia. In August, Mr. Nyusi began a mass vaccination drive for adult Mozambicans, and this week, he renewed his call for all adults to get inoculated. Twenty-eight percent of the population has had at least one vaccine dose, according to Our World in Data, a project at the University of Oxford. The Omicron variant has led to a record number of new confirmed cases in the country. On Dec. 31, the authorities received reports of 4,861 new daily cases, the highest number recorded in one day since the start of the pandemic, the Health Ministry said. The previous day, Mr. Nyusi had visited military forces fighting an insurgency in the province of Cabo Delgado, in the north of the country. There, he met President Mokgweetsi Masisi of Botswana and his wife. Officials in Botswana on Monday announced that Mr. Masisi was also isolating at his official residence after testing positive for the coronavirus. The Omicron variant was first identified by scientists in southern Africa in late November. The United States restricted travel to and from Mozambique, South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi and Namibia, drawing criticism from regional leaders and international health officials. The White House lifted the restrictions on Dec. 31. Mozambique has recorded 192,453 confirmed cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic started and 2,031 deaths, according to official data. Novak Djokovic, the world’s No. 1-ranked male tennis player and his sport’s most prominent vaccination skeptic, said on Tuesday that he would play in this month’s Australian Open after receiving a medical exemption. Djokovic, the men’s tournament’s defending champion, revealed his plans in a post on his Instagram account alongside a photograph of himself with luggage on an airport tarmac. “I’m heading Down Under with an exemption permission,” he wrote. “Let’s go 2022.” Tournament officials confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that Djokovic had received a medical exemption after a review of his application by two independent panels, a procedure that strongly suggests he remains unvaccinated. Djokovic’s participation in the Australian Open, the tennis season’s first major, was in doubt as recently as last week, when he reportedly withdrew from an event in Sydney. Djokovic, who has had Covid, has consistently refused to say whether he has been inoculated or intends to be. According to the rules for the Australian Open, all participants must be vaccinated against the coronavirus or apply for and receive a medical exemption from an independent panel of experts. In December, Djokovic’s father, Srdjan Djokovic, raised new questions about his son’s participation, and his vaccination status, when he suggested that Djokovic was unlikely to play in Australia “under these blackmails and conditions.” Those comments came only days before Novak Djokovic was named as a participant in the Australian Open by the tournament’s organizers when they released the entry list for the main draw. “Defending champion Djokovic will play for an incredible 10th Australian Open trophy — and a men’s record 21st major singles title — and will be the favorite in a draw which showcases 49 of the world’s top 50,” the tournament said in a statement announcing the field. But Craig Tiley, the chief executive of Tennis Australia, which hosts the tournament, quickly moved to clarify that Djokovic’s inclusion in the entry list was not a confirmation that he had agreed to be vaccinated, or that he would be allowed to enter Australia, which has some of the world’s most strict coronavirus protocols for foreigners. “As a matter of course, everyone goes on the entry list,” Tiley said in a local television interview at the time. “It’s not a commitment list about who’s exactly in the draw. That comes in several weeks’ time, when the actual list, and draw, gets finalized for the Australian Open.” The Open’s draw will be held Jan. 10. The tournament begins on Jan. 17. The police in Spain are investigating major cases of theft or the illegal trafficking of Covid test kits amid a serious shortage of the tests. The national police released a video showing their seizure of 300,000 unauthorized antigen tests from a warehouse on Dec. 29 in the municipality of Fuenlabrada on the outskirts of Madrid, the capital.And near Barcelona, 208,000 antigen tests were stolen from a warehouse on New Year’s Eve. The criminal activity comes at a time when the shortage of test kits has prompted panic buying and long lines outside pharmacies and health care centers. Before Christmas, Spain’s health minister, Carolina Darias, warned that the shortage of tests had become a “maximum worry” amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. She said the spread of the variant had increased demand for tests by more than 1,000 percent in two weeks. On Monday, Spain reported about 35,000 new daily cases. The 14-day average case rate has climbed to almost 2,300 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In other news from around the world:  The economic recovery in New York will continue to lag that of the United States for years, with the city not expected to rebuild its labor force to prepandemic levels until late 2025, a year later than initially projected, according to a new economic forecast by the city’s Independent Budget Office. The report lays out a challenging road to recovery for New York, whose economy is underpinned by service industries closely tied to travel and tourism that collapsed at the start of the pandemic in spring 2020 and have been slow to recover. Parts of the city’s economy have thrived during the pandemic — Wall Street firms and lately, residential sales — but the course of the coronavirus will largely dictate how and when New York rebounds, the city agency said. The broader national economy has regained nearly all the jobs lost during the pandemic, but New York has regained only about 35 percent of its lost jobs in 2020, the report said. The prognosis also raises major questions about the impact of hybrid work on the value of office buildings, which pay a significant share of the city’s property taxes, and the future of brick-and-mortar retail, which was struggling even before the pandemic accelerated the move to online shopping. “The increasingly unpredictable nature of the spread of Covid-19 variants continues to confound economic forecasts and will remain one of — if not the primary — risk to the stability of the city’s financial plan,” the report said. The city government has avoided drastic cuts or tax increases because of $22 billion in federal aid for schools and city departments. The Independent Budget Office warned that the assistance has masked the true economic challenges confronting the city. The city’s economy is expected to grow 4.4 percent in 2022, fueled by a demand for workers, but slow considerably in the following years, the agency said. The city could have 4.694 million workers at the end of 2025, a slight increase from the 4.679 million workers at the end of 2019. But one key industry will take longer to recover: leisure and hospitality. By late 2025, the sector is projected to have 100,000 fewer employees than in late 2019 as tourism is slow to rebound and business travel is reduced significantly. A major source of income from tourism, the hotel occupancy tax, could reach $577 million in 2025, up from $85 million in 2021 but still below 2019 levels, the agency said. “With so many New York City residents’ employment and well-being directly tied to the tourism industry, even modest declines in tourism could have major impacts on the city’s economy,” the report said."

Another, in suburban New Jersey, expressed frustration that her highly vaccinated district had returned to remote learning. One in Chicago said she hoped the city’s teachers followed through on their threat to walk out so her 12-year-old daughter wouldn’t have to return to a crowded classroom. This is parenthood nearly two years into the pandemic, as schools reopen after the holidays. Or don’t. Or do halfway, or open and close again, or — they’re not sure. They’ll let you know tomorrow. The New York Times asked parents to share how they were handling their schools’ approaches. Hundreds responded, almost all of them mothers. Their answers varied widely in specifics but mostly boiled down to: Not well. “I am screaming inside,” wrote Cathy Nieng, the Chicago mother. “I cry a lot,” said Juliana Gamble, whose children — ages 2 and 7 — have been in school and day care in Boston for just 11 days in the past eight weeks. “I feel a total loss of control of my life.” Kate Hurley, of Minneapolis, sent her 7-year-old daughter to school on Monday with a KN95 mask but kept her 4-year-old son home because he isn’t eligible for a vaccine yet. “When we started the pandemic, parenting and teaching while working remotely was hard,” she wrote. “Now we are tired and drained and nearly two years in. Doing it all over again feels insurmountable.” Some parents whose children are learning remotely are upset that they aren’t in school in person. Some whose children are learning in person are upset that they can’t be remote. Many are torturously ambivalent, trying to claw good solutions out of situations that offer none. “I don’t want him to miss out on weeks of school, and it looks like Omicron is with us for at least that long,” wrote Heather Malin, whose 5-year-old son is in kindergarten in person in New York City this week. “It was an agonizing decision. Will he be safe? Will the school have the resources to test and adequately mask everyone? I’m scheduled to have surgery for breast cancer in a few weeks, and I am terrified that we’ll come down with Covid (which is bad enough) and my surgery will be delayed.” Erika Behling, whose 13-year-old daughter is attending school in person in Silver Lake, Wis., said that one relative was currently hospitalized and another had a serious health condition. “My child is vaccinated and diligently masks, but we live in a fairly rural area where the pandemic has become politicized,” Ms. Behling wrote. “As the numbers rise, we feel the walls closing in around us. My 13-year-old has more compassion than the vast majority of adults I see in this area. And she’s scared. As parents, we feel utterly helpless.” Many parents said they didn’t trust other members of their communities to take precautions. “I sent my kids to public school in more robust masks than they usually wear, but I don’t have any other way to protect them,” wrote Andrea Rease, a health care worker in San Francisco who said there were some unvaccinated children and parents at the school where her three 5-year-olds attend kindergarten. “They are freshly vaccinated, but I don’t feel the relief I thought I would.” Others described the toll that a year or more of remote learning had taken on their children, and the pain of suddenly returning to it. Danielle Kline Haber wrote that about an hour into remote learning on Monday, after months in which her son’s school in Hamilton Township, N.J., had been open, “our 14-year-old came out from his room and said, ‘I had forgotten how much I hate virtual learning.’” In a follow-up interview, she said she was exhausted from the “constantly shifting guidance.” Marise, a mother in Philadelphia — who asked to be identified by her middle name because she did not want to cause conflict at her children’s private school before she could transfer them to public school, which is open in person — said that her children, ages 6 and 8, had suffered mentally and academically from remote learning. “Our school is still operating as though it is March 2020,” she said, adding that she had no idea when the school would reopen; administrators plan to test the entire student body on Tuesday before deciding. She is a nurse and can’t work remotely, and while her husband can do so this week, they will have no access to child care once he has to return to the office. “Schools should be the absolute last thing to close,” Marise said. “I can eat in a restaurant today, but my kids are home. This is nonsensical.” Kate, who asked that her last name be withheld because speaking publicly could jeopardize her job, is also frustrated that schools in her town, Maplewood, N.J., are remote this week. She said she feared that even when they reopened for in-person learning, her children — ages 7 and 10 — would have their education disrupted because every student in a class is defined as a close contact if one person in the class tests positive, even if all students were masked. (Fully vaccinated children like hers would not have to quarantine if asymptomatic. But students who haven’t completed their vaccination series would have to quarantine for 14 days, and that could mean enough absences to affect the whole class.) “My kids were out of school for 14 months. I can’t do this again. It’s put me over the edge,” Kate wrote, adding that she supported the school’s mask requirement but opposed its quarantine protocol, which has not been loosened in response to new C.D.C. guidelines. “It is incredibly frustrating to see kids in school across the country where families have done nothing to prevent the spread of Covid, and then to live in a community with around 80-90 percent vaccination rate and watch my kids struggle to have a normal school experience.” Susannah Krug, a mother of four school-age children in North Plains, Ore., said she had kept her 14-year-old and two 17-year-olds home on Monday. But she sent her 10-year-old — who has had his first vaccine shot — to school “even though I’m scared to death.” “He just did so poorly when school was closed for 18 months,” she wrote. Alissa Greene, a New Yorker whose 5-year-old daughter’s school is operating in person, said the family had “chosen to keep her in school even though a part of me wants to keep her home.” “I think her school is doing everything they can, but I’m still apprehensive,” Ms. Greene said, adding that increasing pediatric hospitalizations made her more fearful now than last fall, even though her daughter is vaccinated. “We lost her grandmother to Covid in April 2020 and very nearly her grandfather too. That’s the hardest part for me, knowing how badly it can go, how mysteriously this virus can affect people, and feeling like I have to send her out to take her chances with it.” The latest surge, she and other parents said, has brought an uncertainty that feels overwhelming. “The Omicron calculus is far more wearying than the other Covid math we’ve had to do,” wrote Joe Roland, of Great Barrington, Mass., whose household ranges in age from his 9-year-old son to an 86-year-old relative. “Whether it be from attrition throughout the pandemic, or the multiple variables — definitely more contagious, likely less dangerous, still don’t know what we don’t know — the last few weeks seem as hard as any we’ve had since the beginning of all of this.”"
119,The New York Times,nytimes,"Prenatal tests initially looked for Down syndrome and worked very well. But as manufacturers tried to outsell each other, they began offering additional screenings for increasingly rare conditions — and often got it wrong. https://nyti.ms/3FY9UuG",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3FWMDcP%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1G1Sl_wrlZSctYNNUGHEHurl3c8ukAJ_Hs7_9Iq2Hvxupx1KOCS0bp500&h=AT1Ksxh_6OZCScdCHULkCHFh65rmdx8kbFP3kuLSctvI8XkKndJR8UZTjaocMrnFyxrt7Vq_-YeqH8M2rx9maswlmB0Kk02JveNHa9zgYA_YG-m6AywlSayZAC6egySjhC_SFnFeSvSKuocKrzuI&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT1WJHmYj8TixYxeseNXUMgHoPVYFMBlz3sTVmchfmYF-J_jk_La1xYUXeelIuRgPX7DfGJsXmjOtnWEl0O4me7xUgrGyOssCueVmJOuW55VKczP3OURhUhux28vxo6z7AYtq_QodsIyYcTenddeuQjpJKzbf495dq2sZqjuYV3rvMNL,2d,"April Ashley, a model and socialite who rose from poverty in Liverpool to the heights of London society, a feat achieved as much through her striking good looks as it was through her status as one of the first Britons to undergo gender confirmation surgery, died on Dec. 27 at her home in London. She was 86. Tim Brunsden, a friend, confirmed the death. He did not specify a cause but said she had been in failing health. With her statuesque figure, her enrapturing doe eyes and her Zeligesque ability to rub shoulders with everyone worth knowing among the European chic set, Ms. Ashley embodied the swinging hedonism of 1960s Britain as it sloughed off decades of austerity to embrace material wealth. She partied with John Lennon and Mick Jagger. Salvador Dalí wanted to paint her (nude; she declined). Elvis Presley wooed her. Later, in a series of tell-all memoirs, she disclosed the names of some of her many lovers, including the actor Omar Sharif and the singer Michael Hutchence. She worked, when she needed to, as a hostess and a dancer. But she also cultivated enough wealthy friends that such need was infrequent. “If you decided to fly to Geneva in your private plane for lunch, then April was your girl,” The Sunday Observer wrote in 1982. Scandal seemed to follow Ms. Ashley: A friend outed her as transgender to a tabloid in 1961. Her brief marriage to the son of a British baron set off a high-profile annulment fight, resulting in a landmark 1970 decision denying transgender women legal status as women — and denying Ms. Ashley any of her husband’s inheritance. She eventually retreated from the limelight, first to the English countryside, then to California and finally to the South of France. By the time she returned to Britain in 2005, the country’s attitudes about gender identity were starting to change. When she had left, in the early 1980s, she called herself a “freak” and said that strangers had poked and sneered at her; now she was embraced as a hero. She was named to the Order of the British Empire in 2012 for her “service to transgender equality.” In 2015, Liverpool, her hometown, acknowledged her accomplishments by naming her a “citizen of honor.” “I always say three things,” she told The Liverpool Daily Post in 2008. “Be beautiful, be kind — to yourself and others — and most of all be brave. Chins up — get on with life and be as brave as you can.” April Ashley was born on April 29, 1935, in Liverpool and grew up in public housing. Her father, Frederick Jamieson, was a cook for the Royal Navy who was often away at sea and often inebriated when at home. But she also recalled him as a “gentle drunk” who, after she transitioned, was the only member of her family to accept her. Her mother, Ada (Brown) Jamieson, worked in a bomb factory during World War II. She was abusive, as were the boys at school, who teased April as she began to exhibit female characteristics as she grew up, like rounded hips and breasts, though she still identified as a boy. Ms. Ashley told The Daily Mail in 1970 that as a child she would pray, “Please God, when I wake up, let me be a girl.” Desperate to prove her masculinity nevertheless, she joined the Merchant Navy in 1951. But once again she was bullied for her physical appearance, and during shore leave in Los Angeles she attempted suicide. Back in Liverpool, she checked herself into a mental hospital, where she begged the doctors to “make me more manly,” she wrote in a first-person account for News of the World in 1961. They treated her with drugs and electroshock therapy. “It lasted a year,” she recalled, “and at the end of the day they told me it was no use.” Unwelcome at home, she moved to London, where she started dressing as a woman. During a vacation in France, she met a group of drag performers, who got her a job dancing at Le Carrousel, a famed Paris nightclub. By then Ms. Ashley was taking estrogen and saving for her transition surgery. In 1960, with a reference letter from Coccinelle, a Carrousel dancer and the first known French person to transition, she traveled to Casablanca, Morocco. There she met Dr. Georges Burou, a gynecologist who had pioneered techniques in gender transition. The surgery lasted seven hours. Ms. Ashley recalled that just before she went under, Dr. Burou said, “Au revoir, Monsieur.” When she woke up, he greeted her with “Bonjour, Mademoiselle.” She returned to London, where she registered with the government as a woman under the name April Ashley. Her stunning looks and her background as a dancer eased her way into London’s fashion world, and she was soon modeling lingerie for some of Britain’s top designers. She began acting, too, appearing in a small role in “The Road to Hong Kong,” the last of the Bob Hope-Bing Crosby “Road” movies, which was released in 1962. But her budding career was cut short in 1961 when a friend sold Ms. Ashley’s story to a British tabloid. Six months of modeling contracts dried up immediately, and the producers of the film cut her name from the credits. She moved to Spain, where she found attitudes more relaxed and work easier to come by. Along with modeling, she picked up work dancing and hosting in the nightclubs along the Costa del Sol, including one owned by Arthur Corbett, the rakish son of Thomas Corbett, the second Baron Rowallan. After a two-year courtship — Mr. Corbett had to finalize his divorce from his first wife — the two married in 1963. He was fully aware of her identity, but they never consummated the marriage; each blamed the other, and Ms. Ashley ran away with a Spanish nobleman two weeks later. She bounced around Europe for several years, living and occasionally working in Naples, Rome and Paris. She befriended the actor Peter O’Toole and had an affair with Mr. Sharif, Mr. O’Toole’s co-star in “Lawrence of Arabia.” When money ran short, she sued her husband for failure to pay her a stipend. He countersued for an annulment. The litigation had all the trappings of celebrity scandal — Sex! Fashion! The peerage! — and once again Ms. Ashley made headlines. The case, Corbett v. Corbett, dragged on for three years. In his decision against Ms. Ashley, in 1970, the judge ruled that despite her surgery, she was “at all times a man,” and that marriage between two men was impossible. Ms. Ashley was nothing if not a self-restarter. With a friend she opened a restaurant in London, April and Desmond’s; the food was mediocre, but the crowds were swinging. Ms. Ashley often worked the door, bedecked in Thea Porter caftans and once again running with London’s chic set. Never one to avoid a party, she bragged of once downing 32 martinis in a night. Whether or not that was true, the louche life took its toll, and after a series of heart attacks she decamped in 1975, settling in Hay-on-Wye, a small bohemian town on the Welsh border. In the early 1980s, seeking to start over yet again, she moved to San Diego, where she found anonymity in a studio apartment and a job selling glass swans and alabaster wolves at a wildlife-themed art gallery. At one point she married Jeffrey West; they divorced after about a decade. She leaves no immediate survivors. In the late ’90s, Ms. Ashley moved to a town outside Nice, France, to be closer to her friends. Interest in her story picked up in 2001, after she appeared in a popular documentary about Mr. Corbett’s family. That same year the European Commission on Human Rights struck down Corbett v. Corbett, forcing Britain to write new laws regarding transgender rights. Ms. Ashley saw an opening. She reached out to an old friend from her days in London, John Prescott, who by then was the deputy prime minister. Under a new law, he managed in 2005 to get her a new birth certificate, one that confirmed her as a woman. Ms. Ashley returned to a very different London than the one she had left. If it was still dangerous to be transgender, life had nonetheless significantly improved in the 25 years since she left. Ms. Ashley was once again a celebrity, this time as an activist. She lectured at Oxford, went on talk shows and was the subject of a yearlong museum exhibition in Liverpool. Still beautiful if no longer young, she adopted yet another identity, that of the upper-crust dowager. She wore her hair in a perfect blue-dyed beehive and was partial to orange accent scarves, impeccable etiquette and incessant name-dropping. She wrote a memoir, “The First Lady” (2006), with Douglas Thompson. It was optioned for a film, with Catherine Zeta-Jones lined up to play her. But things fell apart when it was revealed that she had plagiarized large sections of the book from a previous autobiography, “April Ashley’s Odyssey,” which she wrote in 1982 with Duncan Fallowell, and both Mr. Fallowell and the publisher of the earlier book objected. Copies of “The First Lady” were pulped, the movie plans scratched. It didn’t seem to bother her. Nothing did. “I’m a natural optimist,” she wrote in “April Ashley’s Odyssey.” “I have a terrific zest for life that frightens even me sometimes. And perhaps suffering is the consequence of this. It doesn’t have to be, but usually it is. The more roads you cross, the greater the risk of being hit by cars.”"

His Build Back Better Act, which contains $555 billion in proposed climate action, is in limbo on Capitol Hill. The Supreme Court is set to hear a pivotal case in February that could significantly restrict his authority to regulate the carbon dioxide that spews from power plants and is driving climate change. And the midterm elections loom in November, threatening his party’s control of Congress. Since Republicans have shown little appetite for climate action, a Republican takeover of one or both chambers could freeze movement for years. The mounting challenges make the next few months critical to secure the safety of the planet as well as Mr. Biden’s climate legacy, analysts said. “If they can’t pull this off, then we failed; the country has failed the climate test,” said John Podesta, a former senior counselor to President Barack Obama and founder of the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. Mr. Podesta praised the Biden administration for making global warming a priority, creating a White House office of domestic climate policy, appointing an international climate envoy to reassert U.S. leadership on the global stage, moving forward a handful of regulations and proposing major investments in clean energy. But he also noted that the physics of climate change is unforgiving. The planet has already warmed an average of about 1.1 degrees Celsius compared with temperatures before the Industrial Revolution. If temperatures continue to rise past 1.5 degrees Celsius, the likelihood of increasingly deadly wildfires, floods, heat waves and other disasters becomes unavoidable, scientists have warned. Countries must immediately and drastically reduce greenhouse gases caused by burning oil, gas and coal if the world is to avert the most catastrophic impacts, experts have said. At international climate talks in Glasgow last year, Mr. Biden pledged that the United States, the world’s biggest polluter in historical terms, would cut its emissions at least 50 percent below 2005 levels by the end of this decade. He urged other countries to take similar steps. But that will be a hard sell if the United States fails to act by the time countries gather for the next climate talks in Egypt in November. “If you can’t meet the goal, you’ve lost credibility internationally,” Mr. Podesta said, adding that he would grade Mr. Biden’s first year on climate policy as “an incomplete.” When he entered the White House, Mr. Biden identified climate change as one of four priorities, along with battling the coronavirus pandemic, strengthening the economy and addressing racial inequity. It was a dramatic reversal after the tenure of President Donald J. Trump, who frequently mocked climate science, sought to expand oil and gas drilling and loosened a raft of environmental regulations, including those governing greenhouse gas emissions. “The most important thing he did was to draw a sharp contrast with his predecessor within the first days of his presidency,” said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, who has close ties to Mr. Biden. Mr. Biden immediately rejoined the 2015 Paris climate agreement, in which nearly 200 countries pledged to try to hold temperature rise “well below” 2 degrees Celsius. He canceled permits for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have run 1,209 miles from the Canadian oil sands to Nebraska. He paused new leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands and in federal waters, and called for increasing renewable energy production, with the goal of doubling offshore wind power by 2030. Mr. Biden installed longtime climate advocates in key positions and made tackling the climate crisis a priority across the federal government. The early flurry of efforts culminated in a virtual summit in April at which Mr. Biden corralled world leaders to make new pledges to cut carbon dioxide emissions. On Capitol Hill, Mr. Biden led passage of a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that included billions for clean energy research and making communities more resilient to disasters, although it will do little to reduce emissions. But cracks in Mr. Biden’s agenda quickly appeared. In June, a federal judge in Louisiana sided with Republican attorneys general from 13 states who argued that Mr. Biden lacked the legal authority to pause new oil and gas leases. As gasoline prices surged in the summer and fall, the White House sought to increase oil production, even as Mr. Biden implored world leaders to stop burning fossil fuels. Just days after the Glasgow climate talks, the administration auctioned off nearly 80 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico, a record for that location, for offshore drilling, despite a campaign promise by Mr. Biden that he would end drilling on federal lands and waters. White House officials said they were legally compelled to hold the lease sale, which the Interior Department said had the potential to yield 1.12 billion barrels of oil and 4.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas over the life of the 50-year leases. But environmental groups, joined by several Democratic lawmakers, argue that the administration could have done more to prevent the sale and are suing the administration to stop it. Most notably, Mr. Biden failed to persuade the single Democratic holdout, Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, to vote for his $1.7 trillion Build Back Better bill, placing its future in jeopardy in an evenly split Senate. The House passed the package in November. In negotiations with the White House, Mr. Manchin insisted that the Biden administration strip out the most muscular part of the bill, a clean electricity program that would have rewarded electric utilities that stopped burning fossil fuels in favor of wind, solar and other clean energy, and penalized those that did not. Mr. Manchin also scuttled a provision that would have prohibited most offshore oil drilling. The legislation still contains about $555 billion for other climate provisions, including $320 billion in tax incentives for producers and purchasers of wind, solar and nuclear power, inducements intended to speed up a transition away from oil, gas and coal. Analysts say it would help the United States to get at least halfway to Mr. Biden’s climate goals. The future of the legislation remains uncertain, although Senate Democrats said on Tuesday they were determined to see some version of it pass this year. “Objectively, he over-promised and under-delivered,” said Kevin Book, managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington-based research firm. Still, Mr. Book said while the administration did not do as much as Mr. Biden promised, it has taken significant first steps. “The world without Build Back Better may not be as green as Biden campaigned on but it’s likely to be greener still than anyone expected,” he said. White House officials said they were proud of their accomplishments. The administration finalized a rule to tighten vehicle tailpipe pollution for vehicles in the model year 2023, set regulations to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, the planet-warming chemicals used in air-conditioning and refrigeration, and imposed new rules to reduce the federal government’s carbon footprint. The administration also has started work on other regulations governing emissions of methane, another powerful greenhouse gas, and new requirements that publicly traded companies disclose climate-related financial risks. At the summit in Glasgow, the United States persuaded other countries to agree to intensify their efforts to fight climate change. Gina McCarthy, Mr. Biden’s climate change adviser, said in a statement that the administration’s climate efforts were “just getting started.” “After a year of overseeing a whole-of-government effort to put our country on a path to tackle the climate crisis, I have never been more optimistic, more hopeful or more confident that our country is leading the charge,” Ms. McCarthy said. But many activists said they were disenchanted with the president. “Joe Biden started strong with the executive actions back in January and since then he has really been a disappointment,” said Ellen Sciales, a spokeswoman for the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led environmental group that helped spur a jump in young voters concerned about climate in 2020. She said she feared it would be difficult to turn out those voters again in November. “He made a lot of promises on cutting emissions, and we question whether or not that’s on track,” she said, adding that it “was a slap in the face” to environmentalists when Mr. Biden went to Glasgow to declare the United States a climate leader only to quickly lease millions of acres in the Gulf to oil and gas companies for drilling. Meanwhile, the administration has been slow to make progress on major new environmental regulations, in part because agencies were hollowed out during the Trump administration, leaving a crush of work to fewer people. The Biden administration also has intentionally slowed some regulatory action so as not to antagonize industry or lawmakers from fossil fuel states before a vote is held on the Build Back Better Act, according to three people close to the administration. The Environmental Protection Agency said it was working on tough new tailpipe emissions rules that would impact vehicles in the model year 2027 and was also designing new regulations for electric utilities. Rules that had been expected regarding limits on mercury emissions from power plants and regulations around wastewater from coal plants are also still in progress. “While it’s important to do things quickly, it’s also important to do a good job,” said Richard Revesz, a professor of environmental law at New York University. He noted that the Trump administration moved rapidly to undo former President Barack Obama’s policies and most of those efforts were considered rushed and sloppy, leading to a high rate of decisions being overturned by courts. But Mr. Revesz noted that the process of writing regulations is time consuming, and rules that are not finalized early in a presidential term can be more easily undone by a future administration. “If they haven’t moved by the end of next year the administration will have missed a significant opportunity,” he said. Legal experts also warn that the administration can’t count on regulatory efforts. This year the Supreme Court will hear a case brought by Republican-led states and coal companies to limit the E.P.A.’s ability to cut emissions. “I think this Supreme Court case is going to establish really firmly the limits of E.P.A.’s authority,” said Jeffrey Holmstead, a lawyer at Bracewell LLP who served in the Environmental Protection Agency during both Bush administrations. Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said he saw 2022 as a make-or-break year. “Most of the hard work remains ahead of us,” Mr. Bapna said."

Trump or his allies. That’s not the primary mission of the committee, which is planning to write a comprehensive report about what led to the violence on Jan. 6 while making recommendations to try to avoid anything like it happening again. But as the committee and its dozens of investigators issue subpoenas for documents, phone records and bank records, the panel is closely looking for evidence of criminality that the Justice Department might not have unearthed. Here is a breakdown of some of the issues confronting to committee. A criminal referral from Congress would merely be a recommendation for the Justice Department to investigate a case. It would carry no legal weight, since Congress has no authority to tell federal prosecutors what charges to pursue. But given that the Jan. 6 committee’s staff is led by a bipartisan pair of former U.S. attorneys, any recommendation they make would most likely be taken seriously by federal prosecutors. A referral could also have a substantial political impact by increasing public pressure on Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, who has largely sidestepped questions about what prosecutors are doing to examine the conduct of Mr. Trump and his aides as they promoted baseless allegations of voter fraud. For at least one crime, however, a congressional referral does carry a legal order. If the House votes to find someone in contempt of Congress, the Justice Department is obligated to bring the case to a grand jury. Investigators are looking into whether a range of crimes were committed, including whether there was wire fraud by Republicans who raised millions of dollars by promoting assertions that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, despite knowing the claims were not true. As investigators scrutinize these fund-raising efforts, they are examining whether any campaign finance laws or regulations governing how nonprofits may spend their money were broken. The committee is also examining whether Mr. Trump and his allies obstructed Congress by trying to stop the certification of electoral votes. Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming and the vice chairwoman of the committee, has suggested that Mr. Trump could have violated “through action or inaction” a previously obscure obstruction charge that federal prosecutors have been using to pursue rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6: the disruption of Congress’s duty to certify the final stage of a presidential election. Pursuing a criminal charge for “inaction” by a president would be a novel strategy in uncharted legal waters. For any high-ranking member of the federal government to be charged under such a legal theory, prosecutors would need to establish that the official had a specific duty to act to restore order that was violated. Christopher C. Miller, who was the acting defense secretary on Jan. 6, has testified before Congress that Mr. Trump did not call him during the attack, but he said that Vice President Mike Pence did call and ask the military to clear the Capitol. Mr. Miller said that no call from Mr. Trump was needed because “I had all the authority I needed” to deploy the National Guard. “Generally speaking, omissions aren’t crimes,” said David Alan Sklansky, a law professor and co-director of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center. “But they can be crimes when somebody has a particular duty. So, if you’re talking about an officer of the United States, who has a duty and fails to perform that duty, and the failure to perform that duty causes interference with Congress’s ability to carry out its job, that could be a crime.” The committee could also pursue cases such as lying under oath, intimidating a witness or contempt of Congress for witnesses who stonewall its subpoenas. Already the House has voted to send two contempt of Congress referrals to the Justice Department for Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and his former chief of staff Mark Meadows. A grand jury has indicted Mr. Bannon, but has not yet made a decision about Mr. Meadows’s case. Ms. Cheney said this weekend that she believed Mr. Trump was ethically and morally derelict in his duty on Jan. 6 as he delayed for hours before issuing a video calling off the mob violence. “One of the things the committee needs to look at,” Ms. Cheney said on ABC’s “This Week,” “is whether we need enhanced penalties for that kind of dereliction of duty.” Ms. Cheney was not suggesting a specific charge of “dereliction of duty” against Mr. Trump, her spokesman said. (He later added that Ms. Cheney has not ruled out exploring any legal avenue.) Rather, she thinks the committee should explore whether to recommend changes to current laws that could hold a future president accountable. She also wants the public to be aware of how Mr. Trump waited hours before calling off the mob, according to her office. While pursuing criminal charges is the role of the Justice Department, the committee’s robust staff means it could uncover evidence as it does its work. With more than 40 staff members, including former federal prosecutors carrying out the investigation, the panel has interviewed more than 300 witnesses and obtained more than 35,000 documents. “If they find evidence of something that they think is a crime and they think the Department of Justice should consider prosecuting, it seems to me completely appropriate for them to call it to the attention of the Department of Justice,” Mr. Sklansky said. If the committee does decide to make a referral, the case will reside in the hands of the Justice Department, where prosecutors will determine whether there is probable cause that a crime occurred and weigh their ability to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Mr. Garland testified before Congress in October that the department was not limiting its investigation to just low-level rioters as it examines the Jan. 6 attack. Even so, he said he could not comment further on what next steps the agency would take. “I’m very limited as to what I can say,” Mr. Garland said. “The investigation is being conducted by the prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office and by the F.B.I. field office. We have not constrained them in any way.”"

In many cases, surgery may be no more effective than options like exercise, physical therapy and drug treatments.  Hip and knee replacements, surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome and other orthopedic procedures are among the most common elective surgeries performed today, but they involve cost, risk and sometimes weeks or months of recovery. Many of these surgeries are not supported by evidence from randomized trials, a review found. Even when surgery has been shown to be effective, the review concluded, it may not be significantly better than nonsurgical care. British researchers looked at studies of 10 common orthopedic operations, including surgeries of the knee, hip, shoulder, spine and wrist. They found good evidence of the superiority of surgery over other treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome and total knee replacement. For six other common surgeries, randomized trials found little advantage over interventions like exercise, weight management, physical therapy and drug treatment. The researchers found no controlled trials that had compared hip replacement or knee cartilage repair with nonsurgical care. The study is in The BMJ. “Our study doesn’t show that these operations don’t make patients better,” said the lead author, Dr. Ashley W. Blom, a professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Bristol in England. “And it does not say that treatments do not work if they have not undergone testing by randomized controlled trials. It’s just that some don’t work any better than the best nonsurgical treatments.” Dr. Saam Morshed, a professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the study, said, “I think it’s fair that we hold the mirror up to ourselves and scrutinize effectiveness for some of these operations. It’s important to understand where we have gaps in knowledge of the efficacy or nonefficacy of common surgical treatments.” At the same time, he said, “It’s also important to understand that just because there isn’t a randomized trial supporting a given treatment, that doesn’t mean that the treatment is not effective.” Hip surgery, he said, is a good example. There may be no randomized trials of hip surgery, but there is overwhelming observational evidence for its effectiveness compared with nonsurgical treatment. In other common procedures, the picture may be different. An arthroscopic operation to repair the anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, in the knee, among the most common sports-injury surgeries in the United States, has a rate of success as high as 97 percent in some studies. But when the operation was compared with nonsurgical treatments, the review found, there was little difference in pain scores or the need for further surgical or nonsurgical treatment. The researchers describe a large review of studies of the operation to repair the rotator cuff, the group of tendons and muscles that keeps the upper arm bone in the shoulder socket. Compared with exercise and steroid injections, the review found, there was little or no clinically significant difference in pain, function, quality of life or patient satisfaction with the results. Some studies were randomized controlled trials, giving one group of patients real surgery and a matched group a placebo operation. In two such studies of surgery for shoulder impingement, a condition that causes pain on raising the arm, there was no difference between surgery and placebo surgery in patient-reported outcomes or adverse events. Lumbar spine decompression is an operation to relieve the pain caused by a ruptured or bulging disk, sometimes called a pinched nerve, in the lower spine. Although the quality of the evidence was low, three analyses showed that surgery and nonsurgical treatments provided equivalent improvements. There were no studies that compared surgical repair of the meniscus, the cartilage that covers the knee, with nonoperative care or a placebo. But in 10 randomized trials comparing a different procedure known as meniscectomy, or partial removal of the meniscus, with more conservative treatment, the operation did not provide meaningful improvement in knee pain, function or quality of life. “The best nonoperative care is often multimodal and may involve a combination of physical, medical and psychological interventions, and it should not be assumed that these are necessarily the easiest or most cost-effective options for patients,” Dr. Blom said. “Clinicians should discuss both operative and the best nonoperative care with patients so that patients can consider all options and thereby make informed choices.” Patient outcomes from these surgeries vary greatly, and these differences are important, Dr. Morshed said. “Future research is going to provide more nuanced inferences on the effect of surgery as we begin to understand on a patient level those characteristics that make them more or less likely to respond to a procedure,” he said."

Instead, more than 600,000 people have signed an online petition asking that the honor be rescinded, illustrating how one of Britain’s most successful politicians remains a divisive figure, never forgiven by his critics for taking the country to war in Iraq. The petition, which has no legal force, says Mr. Blair, 68, was “personally responsible” for causing the deaths of countless civilians and service members in “various conflicts,” adding that “he should be held accountable for war crimes.” That sentiment reflects the extent to which the legacy of the opposition Labour Party’s most electorally successful recent leader has been defined by his staunch support for the United States and President George W. Bush in a war in Iraq that became steadily more unpopular in Britain. The petition comes after Mr. Blair became a member of the Order of the Garter, following an appointment made on New Year’s Eve by the queen. Dating back almost 700 years, the order is the oldest and most senior Order of Chivalry in Britain. The current prime minister, Boris Johnson, was not involved in the decision, his office said. Mr. Blair stepped aside as prime minister in 2007, became a Middle East peace envoy, set up a foundation and has recently made a number of well-received suggestions about how to handle the pandemic. But the speed with which the petition went viral illustrates that his efforts at political rehabilitation have had only limited success. “It’s a fool’s errand,” said Steven Fielding, professor of political history at Nottingham University. “His reputation for the moment is locked into the Iraq war. He spent the last year of his premiership trying to establish his legacy, and it was all pointless because his legacy, like it or not, was Iraq, and is Iraq, and will remain Iraq.” Mr. Blair led his Labour Party to a landslide election victory in 1997, was prime minister for a decade and won two more general elections along the way. He pulled Labour toward the political center, helped negotiate a peace agreement in Northern Ireland and presided over a generally healthy economy spending buoyant tax revenues on health and education. But after leaving Downing Street, Mr. Blair became a wealthy man and advised some foreign governments and multinational companies, reinforcing his reputation as someone who liked to cultivate the rich and powerful. He is disliked by those on both wings of the political spectrum: Those on the left accused him of betraying his party’s values by shifting Labour to the center, while those on the right resented his formidable electoral appeal. “In a way the hate is in fact a tribute to Tony Blair,” Professor Fielding said. “If he could see it like that he would almost enjoy it, but clearly it’s painful to him.” Of the other four living former prime ministers, only John Major has received a knighthood-level honor, though Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May served in Downing Street after Mr. Blair. Despite its support, the online petition is unlikely to succeed in its aim of rescinding Mr. Blair’s knighthood, and the current leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer — who has also been trying to shift the party to the political center — defended the decision to award it. “I don’t think it’s a thorny issue at all for me, I think Tony Blair deserves the honor,” Mr. Starmer told ITV, citing achievements including Mr. Blair’s work on the Northern Ireland peace process. “He won three elections, he was a very successful prime minister.” In a speech on Tuesday, Mr. Starmer also praised Mr. Blair’s government, saying that it had “introduced a national minimum wage and repaired the public services that had been neglected under the Tories.” And there was also support from a government minister, Maggie Throup, who told LBC Radio that Mr. Blair “did lots of good things,” adding: “I think it’s only right that we do honor our previous prime ministers.” Professor Fielding said that, historically, it is not uncommon for successful prime ministers to suffer big drops in popularity after relinquishing power, and it has often been decades before their records are reassessed more evenhandedly. That time has does not yet seem to have arrived for Mr. Blair, and for some of his critics, it probably never will. Among the signatories of the petition is Twiggy Garcia, who, while working part-time in a restaurant in 2014 where Mr. Blair was dining, attempted a citizens’ arrest on the former prime minister, alleging war crimes. “I think it is a bit of a disgrace that the queen is looking to knight him,” said Mr. Garcia, a D.J., who is unimpressed by arguments that Iraq should not detract from Mr. Blair’s other achievements. “I think the good things Tony Blair did for this country shouldn’t detract from the crimes that he committed and how we view them,” added Mr. Garcia, who, when asked if he would still attempt an arrest on the former prime minister, replied: “One-hundred, percent I would do it again.”"

The lawsuit was dismissed after a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California said that Mr. Elden’s lawyers missed a deadline to respond to a motion for dismissal by the lawyers for Nirvana. Judge Fernando M. Olguin said that Mr. Elden’s lawyers had until Jan. 13 to file a second amended complaint to address “the alleged defects” in the defendants’ motion to dismiss. Robert Y. Lewis, one of Mr. Elden’s lawyers, said they would file the complaint well before the deadline. He said the missed deadline was a result of “confusion” over how much time they had to respond to the motion for dismissal. “We feel confident that our amended complaint will survive an expected motion to dismiss,” Mr. Lewis said. The lawsuit was filed in August against the estate of Kurt Cobain; the musician’s former bandmates, David Grohl and Krist Novoselic; and Mr. Cobain’s widow, Courtney Love, among other parties. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Tuesday. In their motion to dismiss, the lawyers for Nirvana said that Mr. Elden’s lawsuit failed to meet the statute of limitations to file a complaint citing a violation of federal criminal child pornography statutes. But they also denied that the picture, “one of the most famous photographs of all time,” was an example of child pornography. “Elden’s claim that the photograph on the ‘Nevermind’ album cover is ‘child pornography’ is, on its face, not serious,” they wrote. “A brief examination of the photograph, or Elden’s own conduct (not to mention the photograph’s presence in the homes of millions of Americans who, on Elden’s theory, are guilty of felony possession of child pornography), makes that clear.” Instead, they said, “the photograph evokes themes of greed, innocence and the motif of the cherub in Western art.” Mr. Elden was 4 months old when he was photographed in 1991 by a family friend, Kirk Weddle, at the Rose Bowl Aquatics Center in Pasadena, Calif. The photo of Mr. Elden was picked from among dozens of pictures of babies Mr. Weddle photographed for the album cover, which Mr. Cobain, the band’s frontman, envisioned showing a baby underwater. Mr. Weddle paid Mr. Elden’s parents $200 for the picture, which was later altered to show the baby chasing a dollar, dangling from a fishhook. In the decades that followed, Mr. Elden appeared to celebrate his part in the classic cover, recreating the moment for the album’s 10th, 17th, 20th and 25th anniversaries, though not naked. But in the lawsuit, Mr. Elden said he had suffered “permanent harm” because of his association with the album, including emotional distress and a “lifelong loss of income-earning capacity.” The lawsuit did not provide details about the losses but said that Nirvana, the producers of the album and others had all profited from the album’s sales at the expense of Mr. Elden’s privacy. The lawyers for Nirvana said that Mr. Elden used his fame from the photo to pick up women and benefited financially from the album cover. They described the various times he re-enacted the photograph for a fee, his public appearances parodying the cover, and the copies of the album that he autographed, which were then sold on eBay. They wrote: “Elden has spent three decades profiting from his celebrity as the self-anointed ‘Nirvana Baby.’”"
125,The New York Times,nytimes,"The CDC said it stood by its decision that those infected with the coronavirus can end their isolation after five days without first obtaining a negative virus test, a decision that surprised and worried many outside experts.",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3eMWMNa%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1W0-MEKo1LAEFMkYRoNGtNvYvUuq9-K3p7Kp7erkVApeojfDzDloiIFR4&h=AT0ztqqUWGl1YgFJyqn8iLfxSjVF7xaD9wDGhJDnbiXMNwDuPxZ_rCttvfTx6sk6f0vD8qjSDKNKKR-Qmj_WqrFhdvQwklXLDxv9M1GrmU7KiQO5gYIIbgEbCf7w0SfEmvFdouQD1l-a-bjGr2lQ&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT0kvgRHLNDGFDwM6iCFJzT5tHrhe78VMG5uNCKxpMgVUBjlnc5qwGLGww3T8aqfOIRRnpR8yTXZIao8XIM5ThpS83c5W0WwWNC3PB26I8WpreqtMwNgxDQTrToSR8wIPMKCXnNBKHAIHzRzpl1tJUIb9ZKm35WpAAoRwxaExxunaCJO,2d,"Leah McGowen-Hare wants you to know one thing about her: She is a hugger. If you just met, she’ll give you a hug. If you are a Salesforce client, she’ll give you a hug. If you are considering signing up for Salesforce’s services, then you, too, are in line for a hug. She extended a virtual hug in the middle of a recent video call. But Ms. McGowen-Hare, a vice president at Salesforce, realized that even the people who are with her on Team Hug might have changed their calculation on what is too close for comfort these days. So for Salesforce’s convention in September — which she likened to a family reunion — she landed on a solution, something to separate the huggers from the mere fist-bumpers. The 1,000 attendees of the San Francisco conference, known as Dreamforce, were greeted with three options for pins to wear. Green: OK to hug. Yellow: Let’s do the elbow/fist bump. Red: Let’s wave hello. “Before someone came in I’d be like, ‘Hold up, let me see and get ready,’” Ms. McGowen-Hare said, scooching back in her seat and mimicking the once-over she would give attendees as she located their pins. “It was kind of fun. Like even though I was green, that doesn’t mean my green tops your yellow, right? Whatever I did, I just did it with a lot of energy.” More than three months since Salesforce’s conference, public health conditions have shifted; with Omicron spreading fast, hugging and fist-bumping might seem even less enticing. Still, plenty of corporate workers are required to be in their offices, or are returning in the coming months with new vaccine and testing rules in place. Crisis breeds innovation, and the difficulties of conducting in-person business during the pandemic have exposed office workers to a tactic once reserved mostly for camp counselors, or bosses with capture the flag captain energy: color coding. Employers who want workers to come back to their desks are trying to accommodate different degrees of Covid risk tolerance. One approach they’ve landed on is offering people accessories — wristbands or pins — that signal their preferences for social distancing, masking and shaking hands. Preserving personal space in the office isn’t a challenge unique to this moment. Still, the pandemic has given the task higher stakes, especially for employees who may feel professional pressure to get face time with their bosses. And now, with case counts rising sharply, workers are in even greater need of safety strategies. At some workplaces, colorful wristbands have offered a way for people emerging from nearly two years of relative isolation to silently communicate their boundaries. As an added bonus, wristband companies whose sales plunged in 2020, when events ground to a halt, are pleased to find business picking up again. A Wisconsin company, for example, has sold tens of millions of Covid-related bands to more than 3,000 organizations over the past 18 months. For Wristband Resources, which is based outside Milwaukee, the second Friday in March 2020 was “D-Day.” There were no more concerts, nor festivals or school retreats. Mike Gengler, the chief information officer, was shuttling between his home and the office, but he didn’t know what to instruct his employees to do. Sales dropped to nearly zero for the company, which has 140 people on staff. About two weeks later, orders began to trickle in again. Mr. Gengler checked the delivery addresses to see where his wristbands were shipping, and he found an unlikely culprit: commercial construction. These first-time Wristband Resources clients, which were reopening their construction sites, wanted an easy way to signify the employees who had completed their temperature screenings for the day. It was a eureka moment for Mr. Gengler and his teammates, who realized that the pandemic could shepherd in unexpected uses for a multicolored set of wristbands. By that summer, his company was shipping wristbands to hundreds of offices as they reopened. Wristband Resources ended 2020 without any losses in online retailing; Covid-related wristbands made up about 60 percent of its revenue. The company finished 2021 with better online sales than it had in 2019. “We’re going out for a laser tag event to celebrate,” Mr. Gengler said. “I’m proud we stayed true to who we were while a lot of our competitors chased P.P.E. products.” Mr. Gengler said that because of the typical holiday slowdown in business, it was too early to see how Omicron would affect his sales, though he added that some companies might use wristbands for identification purposes as their vaccine mandates take effect in the coming weeks. At Clyde & Co, an international law firm, the wristband strategy provided a measure of relief for team members who were apprehensive about the interpersonal complexities of in-person work. The firm had required its more than 2,000 employees in Britain to return to the office two days a week starting in September, though after recent government guidance those staff members are now working from home again. Emma Thorne, an assistant at the firm, had fielded anxious questions about the impending return to office all summer from her parents, one of whom is going through a medical treatment that compromises immunity. Ms. Thorne is also pregnant, another factor in her desire to maintain some distance from colleagues. With her red wristband, she was able to walk around the office without repeatedly spelling out her safety preferences. “It’s me not having to have a conversation with someone saying, ‘Oh, please, would you mind keeping your distance?’” she said. “Sometimes that could be misconstrued as me being rude, whereas the red wristband shows it’s purely because of the pandemic.” The behavioral changes that the wristbands encouraged were subtle but comforting, Clyde & Co’s team members said. When people saw someone in a red wristband approach they might put on their masks and refrain from physical gestures like handshakes. The firm reported that the green labels seemed to be most popular. Businesses that want more high-tech Covid protective measures have plenty of choices. Cisco, for example, which has made its return to the office optional, equipped its conference rooms with technology that notifies people when they have exceeded the maximum occupancy limit. The devices also inform workers about the air quality in the space, as well as how recently the rooms were cleaned. But some executives said they had found it easiest to let workers communicate their office comfort levels, and colorful wristbands allow for that tailored approach. Workers can elect for green wristbands one week, then swap out for red ones the next.  “It’s quite nice to know how to approach people — are you comfortable sitting next to them, what distance do you keep — rather than asking what might have been an awkward question,” said Louisa Robbins, a partner in the Clyde & Co’s Manchester office, who at 53 wore a green wristband partly because she felt it put her junior colleagues at ease. “The youngsters like to be in the office, and I want them to know I think it’s as safe as they do,” she added. Nicki Burge, the head of human resources for Direct Online Services, a kitchen product retailer in Britain, ordered multicolored wristbands for her 300-person team when some started coming back to the office in August, though they are now working from home again because of the spike in Covid cases. Ms. Burge wore green, which she attributed to being an extrovert and a “trusting character.” One day she showed up at the monthly staff meeting and noticed a nearby colleague wearing a yellow wristband, so she moved to a seat farther from him. “What I really didn’t want is for someone to constantly explain how they were feeling,” Ms. Burge said. “Having to say ‘I’ve got someone sick at home’ seven times a day when you’re making coffee isn’t easy.” Navigating risk tolerance with friends or relatives can be somewhat simpler, she added, because people have often gone through months of lockdowns together and understand one another’s sensitivities. Those discussions can be trickier among co-workers, especially for brand-new employees. It’s not easy to introduce yourself by giving a detailed explanation of your comfort with proximity and touch. As employees entered Ms. Burge’s office and passed the containers with wristbands, they were also reminded of something fundamental: Everyone has different needs in terms of privacy and space. Office workers have long struggled to find the language to convey to their teammates a desire for distance. Some are hopeful that the new strategies for articulating those preferences might improve workplace culture long term. “Prior to the pandemic, I would go in to hug people and never even think they didn’t want to be hugged,” Ms. McGowen-Hare reflected. “Now we’re able to set the tone for how you interact.”"

The post included photos of a ribbon cutting at the dealership in Urumqi, the regional capital, and a Tesla sedan decorated with red and white balloons. “Nationless corporations are helping the Chinese Communist Party cover up genocide and slave labor in the region,” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said on Twitter. Mr. Rubio noted that the announcement came soon after President Biden signed legislation that would ban the import of a wide array of products made in Xinjiang unless companies can prove that they were not made with forced labor. Tesla is not the only carmaker operating in Xinjiang. Volkswagen, which sells more cars in China than any other country, has faced criticism for operating a factory in Urumqi. The automaker has said that it does not use forced labor. China is the world’s largest car market and is growing, while sales in Europe and the United States are stagnant. Carmakers’ dependence on China makes them susceptible to pressure from government officials to establish operations in Xinjiang, an arid region in the country’s northwest that has lagged other regions in economic development. Tesla, which dominates sales of electric cars around the world, operates a factory in Shanghai that Chinese officials have allowed it to run without a local joint venture partner, a privilege that it had not previously granted to other foreign automakers. China is one of the biggest markets for the company’s cars, and Tesla exports vehicles from the Shanghai factory to other countries, too. China has denied repressing members of the Uyghur ethnic group, and mounted a determined propaganda campaign to push the narrative that Xinjiang is a happy, prosperous place. The criticism of Tesla tarnishes what was otherwise a triumphant moment for the carmaker after it announced that sales in 2021 rose almost 90 percent, to 936,000 vehicles. The increase was more than analysts expected and prompted Tesla shares to soar 13 percent. The stock lost ground Tuesday."
127,The New York Times,nytimes,"Macy’s on Tuesday asked all U.S. employees to report whether they've been vaccinated against the coronavirus, a sign it's preparing for a potential mandate of vaccinations or weekly testing before a Supreme Court hearing on such rules this Friday.",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3qO150f%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1Q96b4FQu76LYOy0owa6Fb3IeDar1LkUBxPxMnBZ3y2neUcH6gvNUzb0o&h=AT3TbyF25eh0_l0JvDrXt1bR87CS2DpN2zP-_i-ZWQKgMW5hc82rehFA_XYwgj9lShZNcKM4w16CDt0D63EXxDRk3TkkSwN4cA5RbmWhY-HxpncpvtOy-qu_mMcN6IzFrh2AhC2LTMrh3A4UY5Jq&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT2pSiPS4gAmJPKSKcFqbK69RKChpFDkJ2YNjOTK3ZFoMhmV0mPahG4_F8NrjvFDTS8_ucngAV7nPW8bV7SDrF5vIVSzSe7aznpt_hefHeR4tQdP5Ur9-4y5nJlpx-C6dpV2_HwNlYj6buwqNPcq2YBvtoNN-bTAvWKzsYRaLPSLBTp_,2d,"Public school officials in Chicago canceled classes for Wednesday amid a clash with the teachers’ union, whose members had threatened to stay home in a bid to force instruction online during a coronavirus surge. Union members had criticized the district’s response to the Omicron variant, which has pushed cases in the city to record levels, and said conditions in classrooms were unsafe. The Chicago Teachers Union said late Tuesday night that 73 percent of members who voted favored pausing in-person instruction. But Mayor Lori Lightfoot said reverting to online schooling was unacceptable and unnecessary, and her administration decided to call off class altogether — keeping the buildings open for emergency child care — rather than return to virtual instruction. “Nobody signs up for being a home-schooler at the last minute,” Ms. Lightfoot said. “We can’t forget about how disruptive that remote process is to individual parents who have to work, who can’t afford the luxury of staying home.” Ms. Lightfoot, a Democrat, urged teachers to report to work and suggested they were considering an illegal work stoppage. As highly contagious Omicron rears its head, so do debates that were considered settled. After a relatively calm fall, when school administrators, unions and families largely agreed that remote schooling was a nonstarter, the brinkmanship between the third-largest U.S. district and its union exposes just how quickly that political consensus can fall away. Like other school systems, Chicago has had to confront a shortage of tests, and a far from universal vaccination rate among students. There have been large numbers of staff members calling in sick, and widespread anxiety among just about everyone. Other districts, including in Cleveland, Milwaukee and Atlanta, have also gone online temporarily, but without a public labor dispute. The ongoing chaos has unnerved parents who are desperate for some kind of stability. Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Chicago to their highest rate since the pandemic began. But as in the rest of the country, vaccinated adults have had lower rates of hospitalization and death, while children of all ages — regardless of vaccination status — have overwhelmingly been spared severe outcomes. In addition, data from Chicago and elsewhere shows that in-school transmission of the coronavirus has been limited, with a majority of teacher and student cases originating outside school buildings. More than 90 percent of Chicago Public Schools employees are fully vaccinated. Still, members of the powerful Chicago Teachers Union have accused the school district of failing to adjust to Omicron, and the growing threat of breakthrough infections. During the holiday break, they had asked for either universal P.C.R. testing of students and staff or a two-week transition to remote learning. “We are between a rock and a hard place — the rock being the pandemic, the hard place being an intractable, incompetent mayor,” Stacy Davis Gates, the union’s vice president, said this week. She added, “We said a two-week pause so they could get themselves together, have the proper communication, put in the necessary mitigations.” Despite sharp criticism, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday stood by its recommendation that Americans infected with the coronavirus end their isolation after five days without first obtaining a negative virus test. The agency guidelines, released last week, shortened the recommended isolation period from 10 days to five for infected people who do not have symptoms, or whose symptoms are resolving. But the agency did not recommend testing before leaving isolation, an omission that surprised and worried many outside experts. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director, told The New York Times last week that the recommendation was based on evidence showing that the vast majority of transmissibility happens in the two days before symptoms and the two to three days after onset. The guidelines suggested that following isolation, recovered people wear a mask around others for another five days. Dr. Walensky defended the decision to omit testing, saying that rapid tests are not reliable for determining when an individual is no longer contagious. The Food and Drug Administration also said last week that rapid tests might be less reliable at picking up Omicron, compared with infections caused by previous variants. But the agency declined to elaborate on the basis for that assertion. Many public health experts said ending isolation at five days was risky, and that the agency should at least urge people to test negative before mingling with others. They also derided the agency for what some saw as a capitulation to pressure from corporations buckling under staff shortages during the Omicron surge. Responding to some of the criticisms, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top coronavirus adviser, said on Sunday that the C.D.C. was considering adding testing to its recommendations, and would clarify the guidance within days. The agency was widely expected to add testing to its guidance as early as Tuesday. But in a surprising move, officials updated the C.D.C. website without a testing requirement. The agency on Tuesday also provided scientific rationale for shortening the isolation period. The guidelines now say that an individual who “has access to a test and wants to test” at the end of the isolation period may do so, but stops short of a recommendation to test. The new guidelines “facilitate individual social and well-being needs, return to work, and maintenance of critical infrastructure,” according to an update posted on Tuesday to the agency’s website. For people exposed to the virus who are unvaccinated or have not yet received a booster dose of one of the vaccines, the agency now recommends a quarantine of five days, followed by strict mask use for another five. People who have received a booster shot do not need to quarantine following an exposure, but should wear a mask for 10 days afterward, according to the guidelines. Women who received Covid vaccinations while pregnant were at no greater risk of delivering their babies prematurely or of giving birth to unusually small babies than pregnant women who did not get vaccinated, a new study reports. The study, one of the first to examine the health of babies born to women vaccinated during pregnancy, was a reassuring signal. Low-birth-weight babies and infants born early are more likely to experience developmental delays and other health problems. An earlier study had found that women vaccinated during pregnancy did not face a higher risk of miscarriage than the unvaccinated. The new study looked at some 46,079 singleton pregnancies that resulted in a live birth, including some 10,064 among women who received one or more doses of Covid vaccine between Dec. 15, 2020, and July 22, 2021, during their pregnancies. Most had received the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, and the vast majority were inoculated during their second or third trimester. Overall, 6.6 percent of the babies were born prematurely, before 37 weeks of pregnancy, and 8.2 percent were born small for their gestational age, weighing less than 5 pounds and 8 ounces. Researchers found no difference in the rates among mothers who had been vaccinated while pregnant and those who had not. “We plan to do follow-up studies on infants and their development, but there hasn’t been enough time to do them yet,” said Dr. Heather S. Lipkind, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at Yale University and lead author on the new research. The study was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in collaboration with Dr. Lipkind, HealthPartners Institute, Kaiser Permanente researchers and the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute.  The risks of pre-term birth, which appear to be higher when pregnant women are infected with the coronavirus, are well established, she said: “With each week of gestation, the brain develops more. If you have Covid and have to deliver preterm, that can also affect long-term development.” Another benefit to vaccination is that women may pass on coronavirus antibodies to their infants, helping to protect them from illness, Dr. Lipkind added. Pregnant women who become infected face a higher risk of developing severe disease, and federal health officials have implored them to get vaccinated. Nevertheless, vaccination rates remain low among pregnant women — about 31 percent as of late September. Vaccination rates also vary widely by community. While almost half of all pregnant Asian Americans are vaccinated, only 25 percent of pregnant Hispanic women are, and only 15 percent of pregnant Black women, according to the C.D.C. “I can tell you, anecdotally, that in my practice women who are not vaccinated are for sure getting way sicker,” Dr. Lipkind said, “and we’re seeing pre-term birth in pregnant women who had Covid and loss of pregnancy. It’s very, very tragic.” She strongly encourages her patients to get vaccinated, especially now that the highly contagious Omicron variant is circulating. But she often faces fierce resistance, she said. “I think people are just afraid of the unknown in general with pregnancy,” Dr. Lipkind said. “This new research should make people feel a little better about vaccination.” The governor of Maryland declared a 30-day state of emergency on Tuesday and mobilized 1,000 members of the National Guard in response to a surge in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. Gov. Larry Hogan wrote on Twitter that the actions were needed “to combat the current COVID-19 surge.” The emergency order also allows the state’s health secretary to “regulate hospital personnel, bed space, and supplies,” Mr. Hogan said on Twitter. In Maryland, 70 percent of residents are fully vaccinated, including 80 percent of people age 12 and older, according to a New York Times database. But officials have been bracing for what they said may be one of the worst waves of the pandemic. The daily average of coronavirus cases has soared by more than 700 percent over the past two weeks, according to The Times’ database. Nationally, the spike has been no less staggering. The United States is averaging more than 547,600 cases daily, a record and a 254 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are rising more slowly, up 43 percent in the past two weeks, and a smaller proportion of patients are landing in intensive care units or requiring mechanical ventilation, compared with those in previous waves. Deaths are down by 3 percent. Despite having one of the highest vaccination rates in the nation, hospitals were filled with unvaccinated patients, Mr. Hogan said Sunday on the CNN program “State of the Union.” “We’re going to take and continue to take every action we possibly can to help our hospitals, our nursing homes and to keep people safe,” he said. It’s unclear how many hospitalizations are patients infected with Omicron versus the Delta variant, which is thought to be significantly more virulent. According to the C.D.C., about 58 percent of cases in Maryland and nearby states are currently Omicron. The Maryland Hospital Association said that the number of hospital patients surpassed the state’s Covid peak from last winter. A lawsuit filed by Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas on Tuesday challenging the Biden administration’s military vaccine mandate revealed that thousands of members of the Texas Army National Guard had refused to receive Covid vaccinations. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern Division of Texas, seeks to prevent unvaccinated National Guard members from being penalized or discharged. It comes as Mr. Abbott has called up thousands of members of the Texas Military Department, which includes the National Guard, to join in border security operations. The filing notes that about 40 percent of the state’s Army National Guard have not been vaccinated “for either religious accommodation needs or otherwise.” No indication of the size of that force is evident on the Texas Army National Guard’s website, but Stars & Stripes, the newspaper of the U.S. armed forces, said that a 2018 Texas Military Department report put the number at about 18,160. Forty percent of that would be more than 7,000 people. The suit indicated that less than 10 percent of the Texas Air National Guard were unvaccinated. It said that “more than 220” members had declined to be vaccinated in a force that the 2018 report put at more than 3,000. Mr. Abbott, who is facing reelection this year, has barred mask and vaccine mandates within Texas and has mounted a strong fight against federal mandates. The state lags the national average in Covid vaccinations, with about 57 percent of the population fully vaccinated, and its Covid hospitalizations have risen 87 percent over the past two weeks as cases have exploded there, according to a New York Times database. The suit was the latest effort by a Republican-led state government to prevent the federal mandate for their National Guards, arguing that it impinges on their command over state troops. In mid-December, the governors of Alaska, Wyoming, Iowa, Mississippi and Nebraska — all Republicans — asked the defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, for exemptions. At the end of December, a federal judge rejected a legal challenge to the federal mandate filed by the governor of Oklahoma, Kevin Stitt, also a Republican. Mr. Austin, who was also named in Mr. Abbott’s suit, has repeatedly affirmed that the mandate applies to the National Guard. On Sunday, after he announced on Twitter that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, he added that the vaccination would “remain a military medical requirement for our workforce,” which he said “remains a readiness issue.” In a letter on Tuesday to Maj. Gen. Tracy R. Norris, the commander of the Texas Military Department, Mr. Abbott described his intent to fight the federal mandate, but also forecast possible defeat. “I cannot guarantee that the judiciary will grant the relief you deserve,” he wrote, adding, “Win or lose, President Biden must be held accountable for his unconscionable willingness to hollow out the Texas National Guard. Please know that I am grateful for your service and will continue fighting on your behalf.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain on Tuesday said that despite the record surge in coronavirus cases, the limited restrictions currently in place in England were the right approach and would be maintained. “We have a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country once again,” Mr. Johnson said at an evening news conference, adding, “We can keep our schools and businesses open, and we can find a way to live with this virus.” The prime minister said he would urge the cabinet to carry on with the current coronavirus contingency measures, called “Plan B,” which were introduced in early December as the Omicron wave took hold. They include masking mandates, guidance to work from home and the use of vaccine passports, but they fall short of the stricter lockdown measures some opposition lawmakers and scientists had called for. “I do think the balance of measures that we have is the right one,” Mr. Johnson said. He said he believed there was a “good chance” of getting through the wave without further restrictions. As Mr. Johnson’s government has pushed for the Britain to remain open in recent weeks, a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant has added to the pressure to shut down. On Tuesday, some 218,000 new coronavirus cases were reported, and hospitalizations have continued to rise. Absences at hospitals across England have left a number of facilities critically short of staff, field hospitals have been set up to deal with an overflow of patients, and public transportation has been hit with shutdowns as workers have called in sick. Mr. Johnson acknowledged that the weeks ahead would be challenging. But he pointed to support being given to key industries and said he believed the staff shortages would be far less disruptive than a lockdown. He said the government had identified 100,000 critical workers who would be offered daily virus tests to help keep essential services open. Schools in England reopened on Tuesday with new measures, including extended masking requirements and testing. Recently retired teachers were being asked to return to cover absences. And as England’s National Health Service moved to a “war footing,” the government was working to identify hospitals most likely to need military support. Despite the rise in cases, there were some glimmers of good news. England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said on Tuesday that new data showed that a booster shot gave a person around 88 percent protection against hospitalization, and that protection was likely to be even greater when it came to mortality. Earlier in the day, Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, said that he was “cautiously optimistic” that coronavirus infection rates in London in the key 18-to-50 age group that has been driving the Omicron outbreak “may possibly have plateaued.” Professor Ferguson told the BBC that it was too early to say whether new infections were going down, but the growth in some areas had slowed. He cautioned, however, that it could be weeks before the full effect of social mixing over Christmas was known. Holiday socializing may prove especially risky for older populations, he said. “Hospitalizations are still generally going up across the country, and we may see high levels for some weeks,” Professor Ferguson said, adding that the numbers were still far below levels seen during a peak last year. WASHINGTON — The United States government doubled its order for Pfizer’s Covid pills on Tuesday, a move that will modestly increase the nation’s very limited supply of the treatment in the short term amid a record-setting surge in coronavirus cases. The new order will eventually provide enough pills for an additional 10 million Americans, bringing the government’s total order of the drug to 20 million treatment courses. But they will not all be available right away. Only 35,000 of the additional courses will be delivered this month, and 50,000 more in February, supplementing 350,000 treatment courses that were already expected over the next two months, according to a senior administration official. The order underscored how urgently health providers need alternatives to vaccines, as roughly 35 million adults remain without a shot and more vulnerable to severe outcomes from Covid. Tens of millions more have been vaccinated but have risk factors that also make them especially vulnerable. The new order also suggests that the federal pandemic response will increasingly rely on oral treatments, which are scarce and facing intense demand. “We may need even more,” President Biden said on Tuesday, announcing the move ahead of a Covid briefing he was set to receive from health advisers. “That’s the estimate we need right now.” The government has agreed to pay Pfizer $530 for each treatment course, the same amount it paid for its initial order late last year, the senior official said. Monthly deliveries of the Pfizer treatment, known as Paxlovid, are not expected to ramp up into the millions until April, too late to help with the current surge. The combined order is not due to be completely filled until the end of September. Still, Mr. Biden described the doubled order as a key component of the federal government’s Covid strategy. “They’re a game-changer,” he said, “and have the potential to dramatically alter” the course of the pandemic. Paxlovid was authorized two weeks ago for use in high-risk Covid patients age 12 or older. Pfizer expects to produce 120 million courses of it in 2022 for all global buyers. The treatment has proved in clinical trials to be highly effective in staving off severe illness when taken soon after the start of symptoms. Pfizer’s treatment is meant to be taken as 30 pills over five days, with patients taking three pills at a time: two of Pfizer’s pills and one of a low-dose H.I.V. drug known as ritonavir, which helps Pfizer’s drug remain active in the body longer. But public health experts have warned that without an adequate testing supply — a problem in many parts of the country — it could be difficult to quickly get the pills to those most in need. A mother in rural Wisconsin said she felt “utterly helpless” as she sent her 13-year-old off to school. Another, in suburban New Jersey, expressed frustration that her highly vaccinated district hadn’t loosened quarantine requirements. One in Chicago said she hoped the city’s teachers followed through on their threat to walk out so her 12-year-old daughter wouldn’t have to return to a crowded classroom. This is parenthood nearly two years into the pandemic, as schools reopen after the holidays. Or don’t. Or do halfway, or open and close again, or — they’re not sure. They’ll let you know tomorrow. The New York Times asked parents to share how they were handling their schools’ approaches. Hundreds responded, almost all of them mothers. Their answers varied widely in specifics but mostly boiled down to: Not well. “I am screaming inside,” wrote Cathy Nieng, the Chicago mother. “I cry a lot,” said Juliana Gamble, whose children — ages 2 and 7 — have been in school and day care in Boston for just 11 days in the past eight weeks. “I feel a total loss of control of my life.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended on Tuesday that Americans who received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine seek a booster shot five months after the second shot, and not wait six months, as earlier guidance had said. The agency also recommended that some immunocompromised children ages 5 to 11 receive an additional primary vaccine shot 28 days after the second shot, matching the guidance for similar people 12 and older. Pfizer’s vaccine is the only one authorized for pediatric use in the United States. The endorsements come on the heels of the authorization of the same steps by the Food and Drug Administration on Monday. The F.D.A. also cleared 12- to 15-year-olds to receive boosters of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The C.D.C.’s vaccine advisory committee is set to meet Wednesday to discuss whether to recommend that step. The C.D.C. and the F.D.A. share responsibility for setting the nation’s vaccine policy, and have worked to present a unified front in their reviews of booster shots. If the advisory committee does follow the F.D.A.’s lead, the C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, is expected to quickly sign off on the recommendation. The moves come at a time when the fast-spreading Omicron variant is infecting record numbers of Americans each day, and many hospitals in the United States are already deluged with Covid-19 patients with the earlier Delta variant. Federal guidance has not changed for when to seek booster shots after initially receiving the Moderna vaccine (6 months after the second shot) or the Johnson & Johnson vaccine (2 months after the single shot). More than 70 percent of people in the United States who are 12 or older have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C. In total, at least 1.9 million adolescents between 12 and 15 have tested positive for the virus, according to the C.D.C. Children who get infected with the coronavirus are less likely to develop serious illness than adults are, but they can still become very sick and even die. The F.D.A. noted that data from Israel showed no serious safety concerns in thousands of 12- to 15-year-olds who received a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine. There were no reports of myocarditis, a very rare side effect linked to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that has been seen mostly in younger men. The condition involves inflammation of muscle tissue in the heart. Macy’s began requesting the vaccination statuses of employees on Tuesday, a sign it was preparing for a potential mandate of vaccinations or weekly testing ahead of a special Supreme Court hearing about such rules on Friday. In a memo sent to employees that was obtained by The New York Times, the retailer — which also owns Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury — told workers in the United States to upload their vaccination statuses to a third-party platform by Jan. 16 “regardless of whether you work in a store, a supply chain facility, an office, or are remote/hybrid.” For employees who say they are unvaccinated, Macy’s said it would “review your submission and you may be contacted by someone from the Colleague Advisory team to discuss next steps.” The company also said it might require proof of negative tests to be uploaded to the same system starting on Feb. 16. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hold the hearing this week to assess the legality of two measures from the Biden administration: a vaccine-or-testing mandate aimed at large employers and a vaccination requirement for certain health care workers. The retail industry had pushed back on a new rule issued in November by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requiring companies with 100 or more workers to mandate vaccines or weekly tests, saying it could intensify a labor shortage that many retailers were dealing with during the busy holiday season. Since then, the Omicron variant has sent global coronavirus cases to record levels, though recent data shows that people infected with it are far less likely to be hospitalized than those infected with the Delta variant, especially if they are vaccinated. Macy’s said separately on Tuesday that it planned to shorten store hours from Monday through Thursday for the rest of January amid the spike and staffing shortages. The news was reported earlier by CNBC. The National Retail Federation, a major industry lobbying group, said in a statement on Tuesday that it “continues to believe that OSHA exceeded its authority in promulgating its vaccine mandate, and we look forward to making that argument before the Supreme Court on Friday.” The group estimated that the order would require 20 million tests a week nationally, based on external data on unvaccinated workers, and that “such testing capacity currently does not exist.” Still, the memo from Macy’s, which has tens of thousands of employees, suggests that the industry is preparing to carry out the rule. Macy’s also said in its memo that it would adopt the new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that recommended shortening isolation periods for infected people to five days from 10 if they are asymptomatic or their symptoms are resolving. The retailer asked in the fall that its corporate staff either be vaccinated or test negative for Covid-19 before returning to the office, but it did not make the same request of store employees. When asked about the memo, a Macy’s representative said in an email that the retailer was “working to comply with federal and local guidelines related to Covid.” Seth Meyers, the host of NBC’s “Late Night,” said Tuesday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus and that tapings of his program would be canceled through the end of the week. In a tweet posted Tuesday morning, Mr. Meyers wrote, “The bad news is, I tested positive for COVID (thanks, 2022!) the good news is, I feel fine (thanks vaccines and booster!)” He indicated that “Late Night” would probably return in a remote format next week, asking viewers to “tune in next Monday to see what cool location we will try and pass off as a studio!!!” Mr. Meyers, a “Saturday Night Live” alumnus, had just returned to “Late Night” on Monday after a holiday break, in a broadcast that featured a live studio audience and guests (including the musician David Byrne and cast members from the NBC drama “This Is Us”) who appeared in remote interviews. “Late Night” is one of several NBC programs produced at the network’s flagship New York headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, along with “S.N.L.” and “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.” Mr. Fallon, the “Tonight Show” host, said that he had tested positive for the virus over the holidays and that he experienced “mild symptoms” while his program was on a scheduled break. He returned to host “Tonight” on Monday. The final “S.N.L.” broadcast of 2021, which was shown on Dec. 18, was also significantly disrupted by the emergence of the Omicron variant. It aired without a live audience or a musical guest, and with most of its regular cast members absent. In his first big test as mayor of New York City, Eric Adams is resisting pressure from municipal unions and elected officials to do more to stop the spread of the coronavirus as cases and hospitalizations are surging. Mr. Adams is holding firm that schools must stay open, and he is urging employers to have employees return to their offices, despite calls from some union leaders to temporarily return to virtual learning and remote work. With coronavirus cases rising rapidly in recent days, a small but growing list of public school districts around the country — including Newark, Atlanta, Milwaukee and Cleveland — have moved temporarily to remote learning. On Monday night, Philadelphia’s school district announced that 81 schools, out of 216, would go remote.  In an interview on CNN on Tuesday morning, Mr. Adams defended his decision to reopen schools, even though roughly a third of parents did not send their children back to classrooms on Monday for the start of the semester. He continued to argue that students were safer at school. “I’m not going to allow the hysteria to prevent the future of my children receiving a quality education,” Mr. Adams said on CNN. On Tuesday, President Biden, citing the lack of evidence that Omicron more severely impacts children, called for schools to remain open in the United States. Local officials should use federal funds from the stimulus package passed last year to improve ventilation systems in schools and support classrooms large enough for social distancing, he said. “We have no reason to think at this point that Omicron is worse for children than previous variants,” Mr. Biden said. “We know that our kids can be safe when in school.” Mr. Adams, a Democrat who was sworn in on Saturday just after the New Year’s Eve ball dropped in Times Square, also urged companies not to allow employees to work remotely, echoing a message he conveyed Monday on Bloomberg TV: “You can’t run New York City from home.” Mr. Adams insisted on Tuesday that he was not at war with the teachers’ union and its president, Michael Mulgrew, who had called for a temporary return to remote learning. “There’s no battle between Michael Mulgrew and Eric Adams,” Mr. Adams said, adding that they speak three times a day and were working together to keep classrooms safe. Mr. Adams has repeatedly argued that city schools must stay open and that poor children in particular suffered from remote learning. He recently announced, alongside his predecessor and the governor, a plan to distribute millions of rapid at-home tests to schools and increase random surveillance testing among students. New York City reported nearly 30,000 new virus cases on Monday, and the number of people hospitalized has surpassed 5,000, according to state data. That level exceeds last winter’s peak, but is still below the hospitalization rate during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, when 12,000 people were hospitalized on the worst days. There are long lines outside testing centers, as has been the case for weeks, and many private companies have said their employees should continue to work from home. Some public officials have called for more aggressive measures to stop the spread of the virus, including Mark D. Levine, the new Manhattan borough president who has become a leading voice in amplifying the views of health experts. Mr. Levine released a 16-point plan on Monday that called on the city to encourage New Yorkers to avoid large gatherings, to temporarily allow city employees to work from home and to require masks at all indoor settings for vaccinated and unvaccinated New Yorkers. “We need to act now to slow this wave, protect our hospitals, and support the sick,” he said. His plan has received support from leaders including Randi Weingarten, the head of the country’s most powerful teachers union, and Ron T. Kim, a state assemblyman from Queens. In September, then-Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered city employees who had been working from home to return to offices. The city has more than 300,000 workers, and about 80,000 of those who work in offices and had been allowed to work remotely were required to return. As coronavirus cases began to soar in December, the largest union representing city workers called on Mr. de Blasio to implement a remote policy for employees who are able to do their jobs from home. On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the union, District Council 37, said it would continue to push Mr. Adams for a remote policy. “Our nonessential members have proven they can do their jobs from home,” the spokeswoman, Freddi Goldstein, said. “There’s no reason to keep them in the office risking their health.” Mr. Adams, who is close with District Council 37 leaders, has said that he would discuss the policy with unions. As New York State all but ran out of its share of a federal pandemic rent relief program in the fall, state officials asked the federal government for $1 billion more — money they said was necessary to keep tens of thousands of struggling residents out of debt and in their homes. But the state has now received some sobering news: it stands to receive about $27 million, less than 3 percent of what it requested. The gap between the need outlined by the state and the money it is getting is yet another stark illustration of just how severe the economic crisis has been in New York and elsewhere. State and federal officials said the need was high in places all around the country and there is only a limited pot of funds overall.  But without more aid, tens of thousands of renters who lost their jobs in the pandemic will not be able to cover their debts and could be at greater risk of eviction when a moratorium expires in less than two weeks. Landlords also will not be able to make up the lost rental income. “If we can’t make up that shortfall, it’s going to mean that many tenants and their landlords are going to continue to struggle with the consequences of the decisions the government made in response to Covid,” said Brian Kavanaugh, a Democrat who sponsored the bill that created New York’s rent relief program and who is chair of the State Senate’s housing committee. The funds are part of a more than $46 billion federal program, set up by Congress through two stimulus bills passed in 2020 and 2021, which is distributing aid across the nation. New York’s share was about $2.4 billion, but by the fall, nearly all of the state’s money was either paid out or spoken for, state officials had said. New York then stopped taking most new applications. There was a chance the state could have still received more. Under the law, places that had not used much of their money could see their funds reallocated to other states with greater need. A county in Texas, for example, voted in November to return some $7 million to the federal government. But in an email sent to the state on Thursday, an official with the Treasury Department said that “the amount of reallocated funds requested” by states like New York and other localities was “far greater than the funding available to distribute.” The Treasury Department did not answer questions about how New York’s share was determined or how much other states may have received. But a spokeswoman for the department said that more money would be redistributed in the future. The amount New York is receiving in additional rent relief was reported by Law 360 on Tuesday based on information included in a court document written by Barbara C. Guinn, the executive deputy commissioner of the office of temporary and disability assistance, the state agency that is administering New York’s rent relief program. That document was filed on Monday in a lawsuit filed by some renters and housing groups over the state’s decision to stop taking applications for rent relief. A spokesman for Gov. Kathy Hochul said the state was “disappointed” in the amount it was slated to receive, but said the state would “continue pursuing all avenues to secure federal funding that keeps New Yorkers in their homes.” The International Polar Foundation confirmed on Tuesday that 11 workers at a research station in Antarctica had tested positive for the coronavirus last month despite testing and quarantine requirements for new arrivals. All of the infected workers — eight of whom are still in Antarctica, and three of whom left on a scheduled Dec. 23 flight — were vaccinated and have recovered, according to the foundation, which is based in Belgium and operates that country’s Princess Elisabeth Station Antarctica research facility. (The facility is named for a member of the Belgian royal family.) The outbreak is not the first among the dozens of research stations scattered around Antarctica; 36 people stationed at a Chilean research base there tested positive in December 2020. But it underscores the ruthlessness with which the virus is spreading, even in the most remote places and among the most vaccinated populations. There are now 30 people stationed at the Princess Elisabeth facility, which is about 2,600 miles south of Cape Town. In addition, four scientists are conducting “remote field work,” according to the foundation. Some news outlets have reported that 16 people tested positive, a number the foundation said was inaccurate. It also pushed back against reports that it had “suspended” flights to and from the station until Jan. 12, saying that no flights had been scheduled between Dec. 23 and Jan. 12 in the first place. “The management at the Princess Elisabeth Antarctica offered anyone who so wished the opportunity to leave on a scheduled flight on Jan. 12,” the foundation said in its statement on Tuesday. “However, all who were on longer missions expressed their wish to stay and continue their work. In addition, a new team of scientists will arrive at the station on Jan. 12 as planned. They were also informed of the outbreak and given the opportunity to cancel, which they refused.” Workers at the station are all vaccinated, but only one has received a booster shot. New arrivals are required to take a P.C.R. test within 72 hours of flying to Cape Town; to quarantine for five days; to take another P.C.R. test within 48 hours of flying from Cape Town to Antarctica; and to take a final test five days after arriving at the Princess Elisabeth Station. According to the foundation, a group arrived in Antarctica on Dec. 9, and all members tested negative on Dec. 14. The first infection was detected on Dec. 15. The foundation said medical staff had “isolated all residents of the station who presented symptoms to such a level that there was a risk of further contamination for others” — leaving it unclear whether asymptomatic workers had been required to isolate, and what criteria were used to determine who posed a risk. An infected person can transmit the virus even if they have no symptoms. JERUSALEM — Fourth shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine produce a fivefold increase in antibodies in recipients’ blood, according to preliminary study results announced on Tuesday by an Israeli hospital. The small, pioneering research study, underway for a week, is meant to test the safety and effectiveness of giving yet another shot of the vaccine to people who have already received a booster dose. Still, there remains debate over whether fourth shots are advisable, as research indicates that Covid vaccines already protect against the worst outcomes, including from the Omicron variant. Any booster is likely to raise the number of antibodies in the short term; the question remains how long the effect will last because antibodies inevitably decline over time. Officials at the hospital — Sheba Medical Center, near Tel Aviv — said the increase in antibodies, which are the body’s frontline defense against infection but are just one of the many parts of the human immune system, could provide protection against infection, with the Omicron variant now surging across much of the world. The study involved administering an additional shot to 150 generally healthy medical workers who had received a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least four months ago, and whose antibody count in blood tests had dropped below levels considered sufficient to protect against infection, according to a spokesman for Sheba. Israel is facing a surge in coronavirus cases, driven by the Omicron variant. In an effort to protect the most vulnerable parts of the population, Israel has already begun offering fourth vaccine doses to people 60 and over, to people with weakened immune systems, and to medical and nursing home workers. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, a strong supporter of fourth shots, visited Sheba Medical Center on Tuesday and was the first to announce the preliminary results of the study. “The fourth vaccine, to a very high degree of probability, works,” he said. Prof. Gili Regev Yochay, the director of the infectious disease epidemiology unit at Sheba and the leader of the study, said it would yield more information in the coming days and weeks. Israel was a leader in introducing the first round of Covid vaccinations and later in giving booster shots, putting it in a position to make early assessments of how effective the shots are and how quickly protection wears off. A panel of medical experts advising the Israeli government recommended last month that the country start offering fourth doses, pointing to evidence of decreased protection against infection in people who were among the first to receive a third dose in August. Israeli data showed that among people 60 and over, the rate of infection from the Delta variant doubled once four or five months had elapsed since they received booster shots. But there was no immediate evidence of decreased effectiveness against serious illness. Health officials took some time to consider the fourth-shot recommendation, saying they were still gathering data about Omicron from abroad. Some experts asked whether the recommendation was premature, given the lack of data. The Ministry of Health acted first to approve fourth doses for people with weakened immune systems, and then for the residents and staff of nursing homes. The ministry expanded eligibility on Sunday to everyone 60 and over, without presenting any new data to back the decision. The decision was based on a rapid rise in infections in Israel and an assessment of the risk of increased serious illness, the ministry said, arguing that there was no time to wait for additional data. But officials were at least convinced that a fourth dose was safe. Sheba officials said on Sunday that side effects experienced by people who received a fourth dose as part of the study were similar to those felt after third doses: mainly mild reactions at the injection site, with a few temporary fevers or headaches. The president of Mozambique and his wife have tested positive for Covid-19 and are in isolation, the government said on Monday. The president, Filipe Nyusi, 62, and his wife, Isaura, 59, took rapid tests and did not have symptoms, according to a statement released by his office. The couple decided to isolate while awaiting results from P.C.R. tests, which were to be completed in a lab, the statement said. Mr. Nyusi is the latest of several heads of state in southern Africa to test positive in recent weeks, among them President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and President Hage Geingob of Namibia. In August, Mr. Nyusi began a mass vaccination drive for adult Mozambicans, and this week, he renewed his call for all adults to get inoculated. Twenty-eight percent of the population has had at least one vaccine dose, according to Our World in Data, a project at the University of Oxford. The Omicron variant has led to a record number of new confirmed cases in the country. On Dec. 31, the authorities received reports of 4,861 new daily cases, the highest number recorded in one day since the start of the pandemic, the Health Ministry said. The previous day, Mr. Nyusi had visited military forces fighting an insurgency in the province of Cabo Delgado, in the north of the country. There, he met President Mokgweetsi Masisi of Botswana and his wife. Officials in Botswana on Monday announced that Mr. Masisi was also isolating at his official residence after testing positive for the coronavirus. The Omicron variant was first identified by scientists in southern Africa in late November. The United States restricted travel to and from Mozambique, South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi and Namibia, drawing criticism from regional leaders and international health officials. The White House lifted the restrictions on Dec. 31. Mozambique has recorded 192,453 confirmed cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic started and 2,031 deaths, according to official data. Novak Djokovic, the world’s No. 1-ranked male tennis player and his sport’s most prominent vaccination skeptic, said on Tuesday that he would play in this month’s Australian Open after receiving a medical exemption. Djokovic, the men’s tournament’s defending champion, revealed his plans in a post on his Instagram account alongside a photograph of himself with luggage on an airport tarmac. “I’m heading Down Under with an exemption permission,” he wrote. “Let’s go 2022.” Tournament officials confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that Djokovic had received a medical exemption after a review of his application by two independent panels, a procedure that strongly suggests he remains unvaccinated. Djokovic’s participation in the Australian Open, the tennis season’s first major, was in doubt as recently as last week, when he reportedly withdrew from an event in Sydney. Djokovic, who has had Covid, has consistently refused to say whether he has been inoculated or intends to be. According to the rules for the Australian Open, all participants must be vaccinated against the coronavirus or apply for and receive a medical exemption from an independent panel of experts. In December, Djokovic’s father, Srdjan Djokovic, raised new questions about his son’s participation, and his vaccination status, when he suggested that Djokovic was unlikely to play in Australia “under these blackmails and conditions.” Those comments came only days before Novak Djokovic was named as a participant in the Australian Open by the tournament’s organizers when they released the entry list for the main draw. “Defending champion Djokovic will play for an incredible 10th Australian Open trophy — and a men’s record 21st major singles title — and will be the favorite in a draw which showcases 49 of the world’s top 50,” the tournament said in a statement announcing the field. But Craig Tiley, the chief executive of Tennis Australia, which hosts the tournament, quickly moved to clarify that Djokovic’s inclusion in the entry list was not a confirmation that he had agreed to be vaccinated, or that he would be allowed to enter Australia, which has some of the world’s most strict coronavirus protocols for foreigners. “As a matter of course, everyone goes on the entry list,” Tiley said in a local television interview at the time. “It’s not a commitment list about who’s exactly in the draw. That comes in several weeks’ time, when the actual list, and draw, gets finalized for the Australian Open.” The Open’s draw will be held Jan. 10. The tournament begins on Jan. 17. The police in Spain are investigating major cases of theft or the illegal trafficking of Covid test kits amid a serious shortage of the tests. The national police released a video showing their seizure of 300,000 unauthorized antigen tests from a warehouse on Dec. 29 in the municipality of Fuenlabrada on the outskirts of Madrid, the capital.And near Barcelona, 208,000 antigen tests were stolen from a warehouse on New Year’s Eve. The criminal activity comes at a time when the shortage of test kits has prompted panic buying and long lines outside pharmacies and health care centers. Before Christmas, Spain’s health minister, Carolina Darias, warned that the shortage of tests had become a “maximum worry” amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. She said the spread of the variant had increased demand for tests by more than 1,000 percent in two weeks. On Monday, Spain reported about 35,000 new daily cases. The 14-day average case rate has climbed to almost 2,300 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In other news from around the world:  The economic recovery in New York will continue to lag that of the United States for years, with the city not expected to rebuild its labor force to prepandemic levels until late 2025, a year later than initially projected, according to a new economic forecast by the city’s Independent Budget Office. The report lays out a challenging road to recovery for New York, whose economy is underpinned by service industries closely tied to travel and tourism that collapsed at the start of the pandemic in spring 2020 and have been slow to recover. Parts of the city’s economy have thrived during the pandemic — Wall Street firms and lately, residential sales — but the course of the coronavirus will largely dictate how and when New York rebounds, the city agency said. The broader national economy has regained nearly all the jobs lost during the pandemic, but New York has regained only about 35 percent of its lost jobs in 2020, the report said. The prognosis also raises major questions about the impact of hybrid work on the value of office buildings, which pay a significant share of the city’s property taxes, and the future of brick-and-mortar retail, which was struggling even before the pandemic accelerated the move to online shopping. “The increasingly unpredictable nature of the spread of Covid-19 variants continues to confound economic forecasts and will remain one of — if not the primary — risk to the stability of the city’s financial plan,” the report said. The city government has avoided drastic cuts or tax increases because of $22 billion in federal aid for schools and city departments. The Independent Budget Office warned that the assistance has masked the true economic challenges confronting the city. The city’s economy is expected to grow 4.4 percent in 2022, fueled by a demand for workers, but slow considerably in the following years, the agency said. The city could have 4.694 million workers at the end of 2025, a slight increase from the 4.679 million workers at the end of 2019. But one key industry will take longer to recover: leisure and hospitality. By late 2025, the sector is projected to have 100,000 fewer employees than in late 2019 as tourism is slow to rebound and business travel is reduced significantly. A major source of income from tourism, the hotel occupancy tax, could reach $577 million in 2025, up from $85 million in 2021 but still below 2019 levels, the agency said. “With so many New York City residents’ employment and well-being directly tied to the tourism industry, even modest declines in tourism could have major impacts on the city’s economy,” the report said."

Trump and his allies are scheduling events and raising money for initiatives intended to make the former president a central player in the midterm elections, and possibly to set the stage for another run for the White House. He and groups allied with him are planning policy summits, more rallies and an elaborate forum next month at his Mar-a-Lago resort for candidates he has endorsed and donors who give as much as $125,000 per person to a pro-Trump super PAC. The efforts seem intended to reinforce the former president’s grip on the Republican Party and its donors amid questions about whether Mr. Trump will seek the party’s nomination again or settle into a role as a kingmaker. Taken together, the pro-Trump groups form a sort of shadow political party that could help start another presidential campaign and, if that were successful, shape his administration. They include Mr. Trump’s own PACs, which amassed more than $100 million by last summer, employ an overlapping roster of former top officials from his administration and have signaled that they intend to embrace policies and candidates supported by Mr. Trump. The groups have also helped reinforce his properties as a center of Republican power, holding events at his private Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., and at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. Mr. Trump has welcomed to the clubs a stream of Republicans seeking his political blessing, issuing nearly 100 endorsements to aligned candidates, including challengers to G.O.P. incumbents who voted for Mr. Trump’s impeachment or supported the certification of his defeat to President Biden in the 2020 election. The candidate forum at Mar-a-Lago is being planned for Feb. 23 by a super PAC run by some of Mr. Trump’s closest allies called Make America Great Again, Again! Inc., according to an email to donors from Roy W. Bailey, a Texas businessman and Republican fund-raiser. “There will be an all-day candidate forum with back-to-back speeches from the endorsed candidates and familiar faces in the Trump orbit,” wrote Mr. Bailey, who was a leading fund-raiser for Mr. Trump’s campaigns and inaugural committee, then registered to lobby his administration. “We want those who attend to leave thinking that it was the best political event they have ever attended,” he wrote. Donors who raise $375,000 will be invited to a private dinner with Mr. Trump. Mr. Bailey noted that the PAC’s national finance director was Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is dating Mr. Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr., and that its board included Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general who advised Mr. Trump during his first impeachment; Richard Grenell, who was Mr. Trump’s ambassador to Germany and acting head of national intelligence; and Matthew G. Whitaker, who was acting attorney general. The forum is for federal candidates endorsed by Mr. Trump. It is not clear how many of them intend to attend. But some, including Harriet Hageman, who is mounting a primary challenge against Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of Mr. Trump’s harshest Republican critics, and Kelly Tshibaka, who is running in the primary against Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, have been asked to hold the date, according to a person familiar with the planning who was not authorized to discuss it. Still, Mr. Trump’s political activities have generated some grumbling within his circle of supporters. One donor who had supported Mr. Trump’s campaigns said he was leery about donating to Make America Great Again, Again! because of concerns that the money would be wasted. Citing events at the former president’s properties as an example, the donor, who insisted on anonymity to avoid antagonizing Mr. Trump and his allies, said he declined invitations to the February candidate forum and to a $125,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner with Mr. Trump held by the super PAC last month at Mar-a-Lago.  Other donors and party leaders worry about the damage that could be done by Mr. Trump’s backing of primary challenges to Republicans who pushed back against his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Mr. Trump was impeached twice, including after his supporters stormed the Capitol seeking to disrupt the certification of Mr. Biden’s victory. Since then, he has been banned from the social media accounts he had wielded so effectively to generate attention and punish enemies without spending any money. While Mr. Trump has announced the formation of his own media company, including a new social network to reinsert himself into the conversation, it has yet to launch and its financing has come under scrutiny from securities regulators. Mr. Trump’s team also has continued fund-raising voraciously online for various PACs that he directly controls, which had compiled a war chest of more than $100 million last summer, and his team has continued financing campaign-style rallies. He has plans for one in Arizona this month, and more to follow, according to a person familiar with the matter. Many of Mr. Trump’s rallies in 2021 were paired with private donor round tables to raise money for his super PAC. He is planning more rallies in 2022 at locations chosen to help the candidates he has endorsed, according to people familiar with the plans. Groups allied with him have stepped up their fund-raising in recent months, indicating they intend to spend funds to promote his causes and endorsements. A nonprofit group called America First Policy Institute, which was started last year to serve as a think tank for Trump world, has the look of a Trump administration in waiting. It raised more than $20 million last year and has 110 employees, including Ms. Bondi, Mr. Whitaker and a number of former Trump cabinet members, such as David Bernhardt (who ran the Interior Department), Rick Perry (Energy Department) and Andrew Wheeler (Environmental Protection Agency). The group held two events with Mr. Trump at his properties — a fund-raising gala at Mar-a-Lago in November, and an event at Bedminster in July with Ms. Bondi to promote a lawsuit filed by Mr. Trump against tech companies that barred or limited his use of their platforms — and it is planning twice-a-year policy summits around the country. The next summit, planned for April in Atlanta, could feature Mr. Trump, according to the group’s president, Brooke Rollins, who served as director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Mr. Trump and says she remains in contact with Mr. Trump about her group’s efforts. She said her group’s goal was to persuade Americans to support policies like those Mr. Trump pursued as president, and “not about getting anyone re-elected,” though she said she hoped the group’s efforts would shape the debates around the midterms and the 2024 presidential election. “The metric of a successful policy organization is how much those policies are part of the debate,” she said. A linked nonprofit group called America First Works is promoting policies that comport with Mr. Trump’s agenda. They include voting rules that make it “hard to cheat,” according to a fact sheet that seems to echo Mr. Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, which his allies have been relying on to reshape election laws in a manner that could favor Republicans. But the raft of new groups has brought with it some of the drama and infighting that marked Mr. Trump’s campaigns and presidency. A previous iteration of the super PAC behind the Mar-a-Lago forum was replaced after one of its founders, the former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, was accused of sexual misconduct by a donor. That super PAC, which reported $5.6 million in the bank in mid-August, was supplanted by the new PAC, according to a statement announcing the shift in October that said the assets of the old PAC would be transferred to the new one. The statement called the new group “the ONLY Trump-approved super PAC.”"

The rule means stores, restaurants and pubs must now sell drinks containing alcohol for no less than about 10 cents per gram of the substance. Officials said the measure was aimed at making cheaper, stronger alcoholic products less readily available, particularly for young people and heavy drinkers. “This measure is designed to reduce serious illness and death from alcohol consumption and to reduce the pressure on our health services from alcohol-related conditions,” Stephen Donnelly, the nation’s minister for public health, said in a statement. The rule requires a price of one euro, or $1.13, per standard drink. That means that a bottle of wine containing 12.5 percent alcohol, equivalent to about 7.4 standard drinks, for example, cannot be sold for less than 7.40 euros, about $8.35. Advocacy groups and public health experts called the measure — part of legislation enacted in 2018 that included limitations on the labeling and marketing of alcoholic beverages — an important step toward combating alcohol abuse in Ireland. “The availability of such volumes of cheap drink in every community in Ireland” has to be tackled “if we hope to address the chronic level of alcohol related harm,” Prof. Frank Murray, chair of Alcohol Action Ireland, an advocacy group, said in a statement. On average, people in Ireland aged 15 and over drank the equivalent of 40 bottles of vodka, 113 bottles of wine or 436 pints of beer in 2019, according to Ireland’s health services. Sheena Hogan, chief executive of Drinkaware, an Irish charity, said the measure was a welcome one, but added that it was not a “silver bullet,” and that it needed to be combined with broader education campaigns. “It’s another tool that can be used,” she said. Though the new pricing would mean that drinks with high alcohol content currently being sold cheaply would go up in price, most premium brands would stay the same, she said. “It’s not the same as a price hike for all alcohol across all products.” Some critics of the measure said it would unfairly penalize poorer people and those struggling with alcohol abuse. “A flat tax of any kind is going to disproportionately affect those families on the lower scale of the economic pyramid,” said Róisín Nic Lochlainn, the student union president at the National University of Ireland, Galway. “It’s not going to stop people buying alcohol. It’s just going to push people further into poverty, especially people who live with addictions.” Many students rushed to shops on Monday to stock up on cheaper alcohol before the measure came into effect, she said.  Drinks Ireland, a lobbying group representing producers of Irish alcohol and brands, said retailers would be responsible for implementing the new law. “As with any new public health intervention, there will be a need to review and evaluate this policy measure for effectiveness.” With the new rule, Ireland is following in the footsteps of neighbors like Scotland, which became the first nation to introduce minimum pricing for alcohol in 2018, and Wales in 2020. Experts say the impacts of minimum pricing on alcohol are still being examined. But researchers from the University of Sheffield and Public Health Scotland have already found that the policy in Scotland led to a significant decrease in alcohol consumption among those with a dependence on the substance, according to a report last year. “You can certainly have a debate over whether or not this is an appropriate use of the government’s public health power,” said Matthew Lesch, a research fellow at the University of York. But he added that preliminary evidence showed the policy was effective at reducing alcohol consumption. The move was a significant breakthrough for public health advocates and indicated a growing consensus in Ireland that action needed to be taken to stem alcohol misuse and alcohol-related illnesses such as cirrhosis of the liver, Dr. Lesch said. He added that other countries were also struggling with similar problems. “This isn’t just about Ireland: the world is very much watching,” he said."
130,The New York Times,nytimes,"The Vulcan “live long and prosper” salute was derived from part of a Hebrew blessing that the actor Leonard Nimoy first glimpsed at an Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Boston and brought to the role of Spock in ""Star Trek.""",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3GazGfH%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1Q96b4FQu76LYOy0owa6Fb3IeDar1LkUBxPxMnBZ3y2neUcH6gvNUzb0o&h=AT2pKViml_QXmG9nwLAo3ENOR68pYuk_iVZBtU3s4RHHteQ0gGGj4p6MRUv0nWMlxcX8YKquu2lYEtubIMEZivfnOsJy6Nt-trw3ui0hZFPNh2VFKg2d98HroIj_YuDcTq98jja6tBVk2srPOR5_&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT1lDtzmHWoTSWIIWg5hc5eSHkHY6M9z6rjqpmM0JKsxi4D0CotJ4r-zbFTc1k-XUCF_q2ZVAjt-VY2wtuh2BR6WeYQF7XcCRkCHPzGlZFhhBRrOxkdZZE8H5UgoQqyOh_04tqs6BW65-7V7Wck69WhMmP20qSNdkXsflx2mPdlWVi3U,2d,"Public school officials in Chicago canceled classes for Wednesday amid a clash with the teachers’ union, whose members had threatened to stay home in a bid to force instruction online during a coronavirus surge. Union members had criticized the district’s response to the Omicron variant, which has pushed cases in the city to record levels, and said conditions in classrooms were unsafe. The Chicago Teachers Union said late Tuesday night that 73 percent of members who voted favored pausing in-person instruction. But Mayor Lori Lightfoot said reverting to online schooling was unacceptable and unnecessary, and her administration decided to call off class altogether — keeping the buildings open for emergency child care — rather than return to virtual instruction. “Nobody signs up for being a home-schooler at the last minute,” Ms. Lightfoot said. “We can’t forget about how disruptive that remote process is to individual parents who have to work, who can’t afford the luxury of staying home.” Ms. Lightfoot, a Democrat, urged teachers to report to work and suggested they were considering an illegal work stoppage. As highly contagious Omicron rears its head, so do debates that were considered settled. After a relatively calm fall, when school administrators, unions and families largely agreed that remote schooling was a nonstarter, the brinkmanship between the third-largest U.S. district and its union exposes just how quickly that political consensus can fall away. Like other school systems, Chicago has had to confront a shortage of tests, and a far from universal vaccination rate among students. There have been large numbers of staff members calling in sick, and widespread anxiety among just about everyone. Other districts, including in Cleveland, Milwaukee and Atlanta, have also gone online temporarily, but without a public labor dispute. The ongoing chaos has unnerved parents who are desperate for some kind of stability. Coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Chicago to their highest rate since the pandemic began. But as in the rest of the country, vaccinated adults have had lower rates of hospitalization and death, while children of all ages — regardless of vaccination status — have overwhelmingly been spared severe outcomes. In addition, data from Chicago and elsewhere shows that in-school transmission of the coronavirus has been limited, with a majority of teacher and student cases originating outside school buildings. More than 90 percent of Chicago Public Schools employees are fully vaccinated. Still, members of the powerful Chicago Teachers Union have accused the school district of failing to adjust to Omicron, and the growing threat of breakthrough infections. During the holiday break, they had asked for either universal P.C.R. testing of students and staff or a two-week transition to remote learning. “We are between a rock and a hard place — the rock being the pandemic, the hard place being an intractable, incompetent mayor,” Stacy Davis Gates, the union’s vice president, said this week. She added, “We said a two-week pause so they could get themselves together, have the proper communication, put in the necessary mitigations.” Despite sharp criticism, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday stood by its recommendation that Americans infected with the coronavirus end their isolation after five days without first obtaining a negative virus test. The agency guidelines, released last week, shortened the recommended isolation period from 10 days to five for infected people who do not have symptoms, or whose symptoms are resolving. But the agency did not recommend testing before leaving isolation, an omission that surprised and worried many outside experts. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director, told The New York Times last week that the recommendation was based on evidence showing that the vast majority of transmissibility happens in the two days before symptoms and the two to three days after onset. The guidelines suggested that following isolation, recovered people wear a mask around others for another five days. Dr. Walensky defended the decision to omit testing, saying that rapid tests are not reliable for determining when an individual is no longer contagious. The Food and Drug Administration also said last week that rapid tests might be less reliable at picking up Omicron, compared with infections caused by previous variants. But the agency declined to elaborate on the basis for that assertion. Many public health experts said ending isolation at five days was risky, and that the agency should at least urge people to test negative before mingling with others. They also derided the agency for what some saw as a capitulation to pressure from corporations buckling under staff shortages during the Omicron surge. Responding to some of the criticisms, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top coronavirus adviser, said on Sunday that the C.D.C. was considering adding testing to its recommendations, and would clarify the guidance within days. The agency was widely expected to add testing to its guidance as early as Tuesday. But in a surprising move, officials updated the C.D.C. website without a testing requirement. The agency on Tuesday also provided scientific rationale for shortening the isolation period. The guidelines now say that an individual who “has access to a test and wants to test” at the end of the isolation period may do so, but stops short of a recommendation to test. The new guidelines “facilitate individual social and well-being needs, return to work, and maintenance of critical infrastructure,” according to an update posted on Tuesday to the agency’s website. For people exposed to the virus who are unvaccinated or have not yet received a booster dose of one of the vaccines, the agency now recommends a quarantine of five days, followed by strict mask use for another five. People who have received a booster shot do not need to quarantine following an exposure, but should wear a mask for 10 days afterward, according to the guidelines. Women who received Covid vaccinations while pregnant were at no greater risk of delivering their babies prematurely or of giving birth to unusually small babies than pregnant women who did not get vaccinated, a new study reports. The study, one of the first to examine the health of babies born to women vaccinated during pregnancy, was a reassuring signal. Low-birth-weight babies and infants born early are more likely to experience developmental delays and other health problems. An earlier study had found that women vaccinated during pregnancy did not face a higher risk of miscarriage than the unvaccinated. The new study looked at some 46,079 singleton pregnancies that resulted in a live birth, including some 10,064 among women who received one or more doses of Covid vaccine between Dec. 15, 2020, and July 22, 2021, during their pregnancies. Most had received the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, and the vast majority were inoculated during their second or third trimester. Overall, 6.6 percent of the babies were born prematurely, before 37 weeks of pregnancy, and 8.2 percent were born small for their gestational age, weighing less than 5 pounds and 8 ounces. Researchers found no difference in the rates among mothers who had been vaccinated while pregnant and those who had not. “We plan to do follow-up studies on infants and their development, but there hasn’t been enough time to do them yet,” said Dr. Heather S. Lipkind, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at Yale University and lead author on the new research. The study was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in collaboration with Dr. Lipkind, HealthPartners Institute, Kaiser Permanente researchers and the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute.  The risks of pre-term birth, which appear to be higher when pregnant women are infected with the coronavirus, are well established, she said: “With each week of gestation, the brain develops more. If you have Covid and have to deliver preterm, that can also affect long-term development.” Another benefit to vaccination is that women may pass on coronavirus antibodies to their infants, helping to protect them from illness, Dr. Lipkind added. Pregnant women who become infected face a higher risk of developing severe disease, and federal health officials have implored them to get vaccinated. Nevertheless, vaccination rates remain low among pregnant women — about 31 percent as of late September. Vaccination rates also vary widely by community. While almost half of all pregnant Asian Americans are vaccinated, only 25 percent of pregnant Hispanic women are, and only 15 percent of pregnant Black women, according to the C.D.C. “I can tell you, anecdotally, that in my practice women who are not vaccinated are for sure getting way sicker,” Dr. Lipkind said, “and we’re seeing pre-term birth in pregnant women who had Covid and loss of pregnancy. It’s very, very tragic.” She strongly encourages her patients to get vaccinated, especially now that the highly contagious Omicron variant is circulating. But she often faces fierce resistance, she said. “I think people are just afraid of the unknown in general with pregnancy,” Dr. Lipkind said. “This new research should make people feel a little better about vaccination.” The governor of Maryland declared a 30-day state of emergency on Tuesday and mobilized 1,000 members of the National Guard in response to a surge in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. Gov. Larry Hogan wrote on Twitter that the actions were needed “to combat the current COVID-19 surge.” The emergency order also allows the state’s health secretary to “regulate hospital personnel, bed space, and supplies,” Mr. Hogan said on Twitter. In Maryland, 70 percent of residents are fully vaccinated, including 80 percent of people age 12 and older, according to a New York Times database. But officials have been bracing for what they said may be one of the worst waves of the pandemic. The daily average of coronavirus cases has soared by more than 700 percent over the past two weeks, according to The Times’ database. Nationally, the spike has been no less staggering. The United States is averaging more than 547,600 cases daily, a record and a 254 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are rising more slowly, up 43 percent in the past two weeks, and a smaller proportion of patients are landing in intensive care units or requiring mechanical ventilation, compared with those in previous waves. Deaths are down by 3 percent. Despite having one of the highest vaccination rates in the nation, hospitals were filled with unvaccinated patients, Mr. Hogan said Sunday on the CNN program “State of the Union.” “We’re going to take and continue to take every action we possibly can to help our hospitals, our nursing homes and to keep people safe,” he said. It’s unclear how many hospitalizations are patients infected with Omicron versus the Delta variant, which is thought to be significantly more virulent. According to the C.D.C., about 58 percent of cases in Maryland and nearby states are currently Omicron. The Maryland Hospital Association said that the number of hospital patients surpassed the state’s Covid peak from last winter. A lawsuit filed by Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas on Tuesday challenging the Biden administration’s military vaccine mandate revealed that thousands of members of the Texas Army National Guard had refused to receive Covid vaccinations. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern Division of Texas, seeks to prevent unvaccinated National Guard members from being penalized or discharged. It comes as Mr. Abbott has called up thousands of members of the Texas Military Department, which includes the National Guard, to join in border security operations. The filing notes that about 40 percent of the state’s Army National Guard have not been vaccinated “for either religious accommodation needs or otherwise.” No indication of the size of that force is evident on the Texas Army National Guard’s website, but Stars & Stripes, the newspaper of the U.S. armed forces, said that a 2018 Texas Military Department report put the number at about 18,160. Forty percent of that would be more than 7,000 people. The suit indicated that less than 10 percent of the Texas Air National Guard were unvaccinated. It said that “more than 220” members had declined to be vaccinated in a force that the 2018 report put at more than 3,000. Mr. Abbott, who is facing reelection this year, has barred mask and vaccine mandates within Texas and has mounted a strong fight against federal mandates. The state lags the national average in Covid vaccinations, with about 57 percent of the population fully vaccinated, and its Covid hospitalizations have risen 87 percent over the past two weeks as cases have exploded there, according to a New York Times database. The suit was the latest effort by a Republican-led state government to prevent the federal mandate for their National Guards, arguing that it impinges on their command over state troops. In mid-December, the governors of Alaska, Wyoming, Iowa, Mississippi and Nebraska — all Republicans — asked the defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, for exemptions. At the end of December, a federal judge rejected a legal challenge to the federal mandate filed by the governor of Oklahoma, Kevin Stitt, also a Republican. Mr. Austin, who was also named in Mr. Abbott’s suit, has repeatedly affirmed that the mandate applies to the National Guard. On Sunday, after he announced on Twitter that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, he added that the vaccination would “remain a military medical requirement for our workforce,” which he said “remains a readiness issue.” In a letter on Tuesday to Maj. Gen. Tracy R. Norris, the commander of the Texas Military Department, Mr. Abbott described his intent to fight the federal mandate, but also forecast possible defeat. “I cannot guarantee that the judiciary will grant the relief you deserve,” he wrote, adding, “Win or lose, President Biden must be held accountable for his unconscionable willingness to hollow out the Texas National Guard. Please know that I am grateful for your service and will continue fighting on your behalf.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain on Tuesday said that despite the record surge in coronavirus cases, the limited restrictions currently in place in England were the right approach and would be maintained. “We have a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country once again,” Mr. Johnson said at an evening news conference, adding, “We can keep our schools and businesses open, and we can find a way to live with this virus.” The prime minister said he would urge the cabinet to carry on with the current coronavirus contingency measures, called “Plan B,” which were introduced in early December as the Omicron wave took hold. They include masking mandates, guidance to work from home and the use of vaccine passports, but they fall short of the stricter lockdown measures some opposition lawmakers and scientists had called for. “I do think the balance of measures that we have is the right one,” Mr. Johnson said. He said he believed there was a “good chance” of getting through the wave without further restrictions. As Mr. Johnson’s government has pushed for the Britain to remain open in recent weeks, a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant has added to the pressure to shut down. On Tuesday, some 218,000 new coronavirus cases were reported, and hospitalizations have continued to rise. Absences at hospitals across England have left a number of facilities critically short of staff, field hospitals have been set up to deal with an overflow of patients, and public transportation has been hit with shutdowns as workers have called in sick. Mr. Johnson acknowledged that the weeks ahead would be challenging. But he pointed to support being given to key industries and said he believed the staff shortages would be far less disruptive than a lockdown. He said the government had identified 100,000 critical workers who would be offered daily virus tests to help keep essential services open. Schools in England reopened on Tuesday with new measures, including extended masking requirements and testing. Recently retired teachers were being asked to return to cover absences. And as England’s National Health Service moved to a “war footing,” the government was working to identify hospitals most likely to need military support. Despite the rise in cases, there were some glimmers of good news. England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said on Tuesday that new data showed that a booster shot gave a person around 88 percent protection against hospitalization, and that protection was likely to be even greater when it came to mortality. Earlier in the day, Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, said that he was “cautiously optimistic” that coronavirus infection rates in London in the key 18-to-50 age group that has been driving the Omicron outbreak “may possibly have plateaued.” Professor Ferguson told the BBC that it was too early to say whether new infections were going down, but the growth in some areas had slowed. He cautioned, however, that it could be weeks before the full effect of social mixing over Christmas was known. Holiday socializing may prove especially risky for older populations, he said. “Hospitalizations are still generally going up across the country, and we may see high levels for some weeks,” Professor Ferguson said, adding that the numbers were still far below levels seen during a peak last year. WASHINGTON — The United States government doubled its order for Pfizer’s Covid pills on Tuesday, a move that will modestly increase the nation’s very limited supply of the treatment in the short term amid a record-setting surge in coronavirus cases. The new order will eventually provide enough pills for an additional 10 million Americans, bringing the government’s total order of the drug to 20 million treatment courses. But they will not all be available right away. Only 35,000 of the additional courses will be delivered this month, and 50,000 more in February, supplementing 350,000 treatment courses that were already expected over the next two months, according to a senior administration official. The order underscored how urgently health providers need alternatives to vaccines, as roughly 35 million adults remain without a shot and more vulnerable to severe outcomes from Covid. Tens of millions more have been vaccinated but have risk factors that also make them especially vulnerable. The new order also suggests that the federal pandemic response will increasingly rely on oral treatments, which are scarce and facing intense demand. “We may need even more,” President Biden said on Tuesday, announcing the move ahead of a Covid briefing he was set to receive from health advisers. “That’s the estimate we need right now.” The government has agreed to pay Pfizer $530 for each treatment course, the same amount it paid for its initial order late last year, the senior official said. Monthly deliveries of the Pfizer treatment, known as Paxlovid, are not expected to ramp up into the millions until April, too late to help with the current surge. The combined order is not due to be completely filled until the end of September. Still, Mr. Biden described the doubled order as a key component of the federal government’s Covid strategy. “They’re a game-changer,” he said, “and have the potential to dramatically alter” the course of the pandemic. Paxlovid was authorized two weeks ago for use in high-risk Covid patients age 12 or older. Pfizer expects to produce 120 million courses of it in 2022 for all global buyers. The treatment has proved in clinical trials to be highly effective in staving off severe illness when taken soon after the start of symptoms. Pfizer’s treatment is meant to be taken as 30 pills over five days, with patients taking three pills at a time: two of Pfizer’s pills and one of a low-dose H.I.V. drug known as ritonavir, which helps Pfizer’s drug remain active in the body longer. But public health experts have warned that without an adequate testing supply — a problem in many parts of the country — it could be difficult to quickly get the pills to those most in need. A mother in rural Wisconsin said she felt “utterly helpless” as she sent her 13-year-old off to school. Another, in suburban New Jersey, expressed frustration that her highly vaccinated district hadn’t loosened quarantine requirements. One in Chicago said she hoped the city’s teachers followed through on their threat to walk out so her 12-year-old daughter wouldn’t have to return to a crowded classroom. This is parenthood nearly two years into the pandemic, as schools reopen after the holidays. Or don’t. Or do halfway, or open and close again, or — they’re not sure. They’ll let you know tomorrow. The New York Times asked parents to share how they were handling their schools’ approaches. Hundreds responded, almost all of them mothers. Their answers varied widely in specifics but mostly boiled down to: Not well. “I am screaming inside,” wrote Cathy Nieng, the Chicago mother. “I cry a lot,” said Juliana Gamble, whose children — ages 2 and 7 — have been in school and day care in Boston for just 11 days in the past eight weeks. “I feel a total loss of control of my life.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended on Tuesday that Americans who received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine seek a booster shot five months after the second shot, and not wait six months, as earlier guidance had said. The agency also recommended that some immunocompromised children ages 5 to 11 receive an additional primary vaccine shot 28 days after the second shot, matching the guidance for similar people 12 and older. Pfizer’s vaccine is the only one authorized for pediatric use in the United States. The endorsements come on the heels of the authorization of the same steps by the Food and Drug Administration on Monday. The F.D.A. also cleared 12- to 15-year-olds to receive boosters of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The C.D.C.’s vaccine advisory committee is set to meet Wednesday to discuss whether to recommend that step. The C.D.C. and the F.D.A. share responsibility for setting the nation’s vaccine policy, and have worked to present a unified front in their reviews of booster shots. If the advisory committee does follow the F.D.A.’s lead, the C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, is expected to quickly sign off on the recommendation. The moves come at a time when the fast-spreading Omicron variant is infecting record numbers of Americans each day, and many hospitals in the United States are already deluged with Covid-19 patients with the earlier Delta variant. Federal guidance has not changed for when to seek booster shots after initially receiving the Moderna vaccine (6 months after the second shot) or the Johnson & Johnson vaccine (2 months after the single shot). More than 70 percent of people in the United States who are 12 or older have been fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C. In total, at least 1.9 million adolescents between 12 and 15 have tested positive for the virus, according to the C.D.C. Children who get infected with the coronavirus are less likely to develop serious illness than adults are, but they can still become very sick and even die. The F.D.A. noted that data from Israel showed no serious safety concerns in thousands of 12- to 15-year-olds who received a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine. There were no reports of myocarditis, a very rare side effect linked to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that has been seen mostly in younger men. The condition involves inflammation of muscle tissue in the heart. Macy’s began requesting the vaccination statuses of employees on Tuesday, a sign it was preparing for a potential mandate of vaccinations or weekly testing ahead of a special Supreme Court hearing about such rules on Friday. In a memo sent to employees that was obtained by The New York Times, the retailer — which also owns Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury — told workers in the United States to upload their vaccination statuses to a third-party platform by Jan. 16 “regardless of whether you work in a store, a supply chain facility, an office, or are remote/hybrid.” For employees who say they are unvaccinated, Macy’s said it would “review your submission and you may be contacted by someone from the Colleague Advisory team to discuss next steps.” The company also said it might require proof of negative tests to be uploaded to the same system starting on Feb. 16. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hold the hearing this week to assess the legality of two measures from the Biden administration: a vaccine-or-testing mandate aimed at large employers and a vaccination requirement for certain health care workers. The retail industry had pushed back on a new rule issued in November by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requiring companies with 100 or more workers to mandate vaccines or weekly tests, saying it could intensify a labor shortage that many retailers were dealing with during the busy holiday season. Since then, the Omicron variant has sent global coronavirus cases to record levels, though recent data shows that people infected with it are far less likely to be hospitalized than those infected with the Delta variant, especially if they are vaccinated. Macy’s said separately on Tuesday that it planned to shorten store hours from Monday through Thursday for the rest of January amid the spike and staffing shortages. The news was reported earlier by CNBC. The National Retail Federation, a major industry lobbying group, said in a statement on Tuesday that it “continues to believe that OSHA exceeded its authority in promulgating its vaccine mandate, and we look forward to making that argument before the Supreme Court on Friday.” The group estimated that the order would require 20 million tests a week nationally, based on external data on unvaccinated workers, and that “such testing capacity currently does not exist.” Still, the memo from Macy’s, which has tens of thousands of employees, suggests that the industry is preparing to carry out the rule. Macy’s also said in its memo that it would adopt the new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that recommended shortening isolation periods for infected people to five days from 10 if they are asymptomatic or their symptoms are resolving. The retailer asked in the fall that its corporate staff either be vaccinated or test negative for Covid-19 before returning to the office, but it did not make the same request of store employees. When asked about the memo, a Macy’s representative said in an email that the retailer was “working to comply with federal and local guidelines related to Covid.” Seth Meyers, the host of NBC’s “Late Night,” said Tuesday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus and that tapings of his program would be canceled through the end of the week. In a tweet posted Tuesday morning, Mr. Meyers wrote, “The bad news is, I tested positive for COVID (thanks, 2022!) the good news is, I feel fine (thanks vaccines and booster!)” He indicated that “Late Night” would probably return in a remote format next week, asking viewers to “tune in next Monday to see what cool location we will try and pass off as a studio!!!” Mr. Meyers, a “Saturday Night Live” alumnus, had just returned to “Late Night” on Monday after a holiday break, in a broadcast that featured a live studio audience and guests (including the musician David Byrne and cast members from the NBC drama “This Is Us”) who appeared in remote interviews. “Late Night” is one of several NBC programs produced at the network’s flagship New York headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, along with “S.N.L.” and “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.” Mr. Fallon, the “Tonight Show” host, said that he had tested positive for the virus over the holidays and that he experienced “mild symptoms” while his program was on a scheduled break. He returned to host “Tonight” on Monday. The final “S.N.L.” broadcast of 2021, which was shown on Dec. 18, was also significantly disrupted by the emergence of the Omicron variant. It aired without a live audience or a musical guest, and with most of its regular cast members absent. In his first big test as mayor of New York City, Eric Adams is resisting pressure from municipal unions and elected officials to do more to stop the spread of the coronavirus as cases and hospitalizations are surging. Mr. Adams is holding firm that schools must stay open, and he is urging employers to have employees return to their offices, despite calls from some union leaders to temporarily return to virtual learning and remote work. With coronavirus cases rising rapidly in recent days, a small but growing list of public school districts around the country — including Newark, Atlanta, Milwaukee and Cleveland — have moved temporarily to remote learning. On Monday night, Philadelphia’s school district announced that 81 schools, out of 216, would go remote.  In an interview on CNN on Tuesday morning, Mr. Adams defended his decision to reopen schools, even though roughly a third of parents did not send their children back to classrooms on Monday for the start of the semester. He continued to argue that students were safer at school. “I’m not going to allow the hysteria to prevent the future of my children receiving a quality education,” Mr. Adams said on CNN. On Tuesday, President Biden, citing the lack of evidence that Omicron more severely impacts children, called for schools to remain open in the United States. Local officials should use federal funds from the stimulus package passed last year to improve ventilation systems in schools and support classrooms large enough for social distancing, he said. “We have no reason to think at this point that Omicron is worse for children than previous variants,” Mr. Biden said. “We know that our kids can be safe when in school.” Mr. Adams, a Democrat who was sworn in on Saturday just after the New Year’s Eve ball dropped in Times Square, also urged companies not to allow employees to work remotely, echoing a message he conveyed Monday on Bloomberg TV: “You can’t run New York City from home.” Mr. Adams insisted on Tuesday that he was not at war with the teachers’ union and its president, Michael Mulgrew, who had called for a temporary return to remote learning. “There’s no battle between Michael Mulgrew and Eric Adams,” Mr. Adams said, adding that they speak three times a day and were working together to keep classrooms safe. Mr. Adams has repeatedly argued that city schools must stay open and that poor children in particular suffered from remote learning. He recently announced, alongside his predecessor and the governor, a plan to distribute millions of rapid at-home tests to schools and increase random surveillance testing among students. New York City reported nearly 30,000 new virus cases on Monday, and the number of people hospitalized has surpassed 5,000, according to state data. That level exceeds last winter’s peak, but is still below the hospitalization rate during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, when 12,000 people were hospitalized on the worst days. There are long lines outside testing centers, as has been the case for weeks, and many private companies have said their employees should continue to work from home. Some public officials have called for more aggressive measures to stop the spread of the virus, including Mark D. Levine, the new Manhattan borough president who has become a leading voice in amplifying the views of health experts. Mr. Levine released a 16-point plan on Monday that called on the city to encourage New Yorkers to avoid large gatherings, to temporarily allow city employees to work from home and to require masks at all indoor settings for vaccinated and unvaccinated New Yorkers. “We need to act now to slow this wave, protect our hospitals, and support the sick,” he said. His plan has received support from leaders including Randi Weingarten, the head of the country’s most powerful teachers union, and Ron T. Kim, a state assemblyman from Queens. In September, then-Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered city employees who had been working from home to return to offices. The city has more than 300,000 workers, and about 80,000 of those who work in offices and had been allowed to work remotely were required to return. As coronavirus cases began to soar in December, the largest union representing city workers called on Mr. de Blasio to implement a remote policy for employees who are able to do their jobs from home. On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the union, District Council 37, said it would continue to push Mr. Adams for a remote policy. “Our nonessential members have proven they can do their jobs from home,” the spokeswoman, Freddi Goldstein, said. “There’s no reason to keep them in the office risking their health.” Mr. Adams, who is close with District Council 37 leaders, has said that he would discuss the policy with unions. As New York State all but ran out of its share of a federal pandemic rent relief program in the fall, state officials asked the federal government for $1 billion more — money they said was necessary to keep tens of thousands of struggling residents out of debt and in their homes. But the state has now received some sobering news: it stands to receive about $27 million, less than 3 percent of what it requested. The gap between the need outlined by the state and the money it is getting is yet another stark illustration of just how severe the economic crisis has been in New York and elsewhere. State and federal officials said the need was high in places all around the country and there is only a limited pot of funds overall.  But without more aid, tens of thousands of renters who lost their jobs in the pandemic will not be able to cover their debts and could be at greater risk of eviction when a moratorium expires in less than two weeks. Landlords also will not be able to make up the lost rental income. “If we can’t make up that shortfall, it’s going to mean that many tenants and their landlords are going to continue to struggle with the consequences of the decisions the government made in response to Covid,” said Brian Kavanaugh, a Democrat who sponsored the bill that created New York’s rent relief program and who is chair of the State Senate’s housing committee. The funds are part of a more than $46 billion federal program, set up by Congress through two stimulus bills passed in 2020 and 2021, which is distributing aid across the nation. New York’s share was about $2.4 billion, but by the fall, nearly all of the state’s money was either paid out or spoken for, state officials had said. New York then stopped taking most new applications. There was a chance the state could have still received more. Under the law, places that had not used much of their money could see their funds reallocated to other states with greater need. A county in Texas, for example, voted in November to return some $7 million to the federal government. But in an email sent to the state on Thursday, an official with the Treasury Department said that “the amount of reallocated funds requested” by states like New York and other localities was “far greater than the funding available to distribute.” The Treasury Department did not answer questions about how New York’s share was determined or how much other states may have received. But a spokeswoman for the department said that more money would be redistributed in the future. The amount New York is receiving in additional rent relief was reported by Law 360 on Tuesday based on information included in a court document written by Barbara C. Guinn, the executive deputy commissioner of the office of temporary and disability assistance, the state agency that is administering New York’s rent relief program. That document was filed on Monday in a lawsuit filed by some renters and housing groups over the state’s decision to stop taking applications for rent relief. A spokesman for Gov. Kathy Hochul said the state was “disappointed” in the amount it was slated to receive, but said the state would “continue pursuing all avenues to secure federal funding that keeps New Yorkers in their homes.” The International Polar Foundation confirmed on Tuesday that 11 workers at a research station in Antarctica had tested positive for the coronavirus last month despite testing and quarantine requirements for new arrivals. All of the infected workers — eight of whom are still in Antarctica, and three of whom left on a scheduled Dec. 23 flight — were vaccinated and have recovered, according to the foundation, which is based in Belgium and operates that country’s Princess Elisabeth Station Antarctica research facility. (The facility is named for a member of the Belgian royal family.) The outbreak is not the first among the dozens of research stations scattered around Antarctica; 36 people stationed at a Chilean research base there tested positive in December 2020. But it underscores the ruthlessness with which the virus is spreading, even in the most remote places and among the most vaccinated populations. There are now 30 people stationed at the Princess Elisabeth facility, which is about 2,600 miles south of Cape Town. In addition, four scientists are conducting “remote field work,” according to the foundation. Some news outlets have reported that 16 people tested positive, a number the foundation said was inaccurate. It also pushed back against reports that it had “suspended” flights to and from the station until Jan. 12, saying that no flights had been scheduled between Dec. 23 and Jan. 12 in the first place. “The management at the Princess Elisabeth Antarctica offered anyone who so wished the opportunity to leave on a scheduled flight on Jan. 12,” the foundation said in its statement on Tuesday. “However, all who were on longer missions expressed their wish to stay and continue their work. In addition, a new team of scientists will arrive at the station on Jan. 12 as planned. They were also informed of the outbreak and given the opportunity to cancel, which they refused.” Workers at the station are all vaccinated, but only one has received a booster shot. New arrivals are required to take a P.C.R. test within 72 hours of flying to Cape Town; to quarantine for five days; to take another P.C.R. test within 48 hours of flying from Cape Town to Antarctica; and to take a final test five days after arriving at the Princess Elisabeth Station. According to the foundation, a group arrived in Antarctica on Dec. 9, and all members tested negative on Dec. 14. The first infection was detected on Dec. 15. The foundation said medical staff had “isolated all residents of the station who presented symptoms to such a level that there was a risk of further contamination for others” — leaving it unclear whether asymptomatic workers had been required to isolate, and what criteria were used to determine who posed a risk. An infected person can transmit the virus even if they have no symptoms. JERUSALEM — Fourth shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine produce a fivefold increase in antibodies in recipients’ blood, according to preliminary study results announced on Tuesday by an Israeli hospital. The small, pioneering research study, underway for a week, is meant to test the safety and effectiveness of giving yet another shot of the vaccine to people who have already received a booster dose. Still, there remains debate over whether fourth shots are advisable, as research indicates that Covid vaccines already protect against the worst outcomes, including from the Omicron variant. Any booster is likely to raise the number of antibodies in the short term; the question remains how long the effect will last because antibodies inevitably decline over time. Officials at the hospital — Sheba Medical Center, near Tel Aviv — said the increase in antibodies, which are the body’s frontline defense against infection but are just one of the many parts of the human immune system, could provide protection against infection, with the Omicron variant now surging across much of the world. The study involved administering an additional shot to 150 generally healthy medical workers who had received a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least four months ago, and whose antibody count in blood tests had dropped below levels considered sufficient to protect against infection, according to a spokesman for Sheba. Israel is facing a surge in coronavirus cases, driven by the Omicron variant. In an effort to protect the most vulnerable parts of the population, Israel has already begun offering fourth vaccine doses to people 60 and over, to people with weakened immune systems, and to medical and nursing home workers. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, a strong supporter of fourth shots, visited Sheba Medical Center on Tuesday and was the first to announce the preliminary results of the study. “The fourth vaccine, to a very high degree of probability, works,” he said. Prof. Gili Regev Yochay, the director of the infectious disease epidemiology unit at Sheba and the leader of the study, said it would yield more information in the coming days and weeks. Israel was a leader in introducing the first round of Covid vaccinations and later in giving booster shots, putting it in a position to make early assessments of how effective the shots are and how quickly protection wears off. A panel of medical experts advising the Israeli government recommended last month that the country start offering fourth doses, pointing to evidence of decreased protection against infection in people who were among the first to receive a third dose in August. Israeli data showed that among people 60 and over, the rate of infection from the Delta variant doubled once four or five months had elapsed since they received booster shots. But there was no immediate evidence of decreased effectiveness against serious illness. Health officials took some time to consider the fourth-shot recommendation, saying they were still gathering data about Omicron from abroad. Some experts asked whether the recommendation was premature, given the lack of data. The Ministry of Health acted first to approve fourth doses for people with weakened immune systems, and then for the residents and staff of nursing homes. The ministry expanded eligibility on Sunday to everyone 60 and over, without presenting any new data to back the decision. The decision was based on a rapid rise in infections in Israel and an assessment of the risk of increased serious illness, the ministry said, arguing that there was no time to wait for additional data. But officials were at least convinced that a fourth dose was safe. Sheba officials said on Sunday that side effects experienced by people who received a fourth dose as part of the study were similar to those felt after third doses: mainly mild reactions at the injection site, with a few temporary fevers or headaches. The president of Mozambique and his wife have tested positive for Covid-19 and are in isolation, the government said on Monday. The president, Filipe Nyusi, 62, and his wife, Isaura, 59, took rapid tests and did not have symptoms, according to a statement released by his office. The couple decided to isolate while awaiting results from P.C.R. tests, which were to be completed in a lab, the statement said. Mr. Nyusi is the latest of several heads of state in southern Africa to test positive in recent weeks, among them President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and President Hage Geingob of Namibia. In August, Mr. Nyusi began a mass vaccination drive for adult Mozambicans, and this week, he renewed his call for all adults to get inoculated. Twenty-eight percent of the population has had at least one vaccine dose, according to Our World in Data, a project at the University of Oxford. The Omicron variant has led to a record number of new confirmed cases in the country. On Dec. 31, the authorities received reports of 4,861 new daily cases, the highest number recorded in one day since the start of the pandemic, the Health Ministry said. The previous day, Mr. Nyusi had visited military forces fighting an insurgency in the province of Cabo Delgado, in the north of the country. There, he met President Mokgweetsi Masisi of Botswana and his wife. Officials in Botswana on Monday announced that Mr. Masisi was also isolating at his official residence after testing positive for the coronavirus. The Omicron variant was first identified by scientists in southern Africa in late November. The United States restricted travel to and from Mozambique, South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi and Namibia, drawing criticism from regional leaders and international health officials. The White House lifted the restrictions on Dec. 31. Mozambique has recorded 192,453 confirmed cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic started and 2,031 deaths, according to official data. Novak Djokovic, the world’s No. 1-ranked male tennis player and his sport’s most prominent vaccination skeptic, said on Tuesday that he would play in this month’s Australian Open after receiving a medical exemption. Djokovic, the men’s tournament’s defending champion, revealed his plans in a post on his Instagram account alongside a photograph of himself with luggage on an airport tarmac. “I’m heading Down Under with an exemption permission,” he wrote. “Let’s go 2022.” Tournament officials confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that Djokovic had received a medical exemption after a review of his application by two independent panels, a procedure that strongly suggests he remains unvaccinated. Djokovic’s participation in the Australian Open, the tennis season’s first major, was in doubt as recently as last week, when he reportedly withdrew from an event in Sydney. Djokovic, who has had Covid, has consistently refused to say whether he has been inoculated or intends to be. According to the rules for the Australian Open, all participants must be vaccinated against the coronavirus or apply for and receive a medical exemption from an independent panel of experts. In December, Djokovic’s father, Srdjan Djokovic, raised new questions about his son’s participation, and his vaccination status, when he suggested that Djokovic was unlikely to play in Australia “under these blackmails and conditions.” Those comments came only days before Novak Djokovic was named as a participant in the Australian Open by the tournament’s organizers when they released the entry list for the main draw. “Defending champion Djokovic will play for an incredible 10th Australian Open trophy — and a men’s record 21st major singles title — and will be the favorite in a draw which showcases 49 of the world’s top 50,” the tournament said in a statement announcing the field. But Craig Tiley, the chief executive of Tennis Australia, which hosts the tournament, quickly moved to clarify that Djokovic’s inclusion in the entry list was not a confirmation that he had agreed to be vaccinated, or that he would be allowed to enter Australia, which has some of the world’s most strict coronavirus protocols for foreigners. “As a matter of course, everyone goes on the entry list,” Tiley said in a local television interview at the time. “It’s not a commitment list about who’s exactly in the draw. That comes in several weeks’ time, when the actual list, and draw, gets finalized for the Australian Open.” The Open’s draw will be held Jan. 10. The tournament begins on Jan. 17. The police in Spain are investigating major cases of theft or the illegal trafficking of Covid test kits amid a serious shortage of the tests. The national police released a video showing their seizure of 300,000 unauthorized antigen tests from a warehouse on Dec. 29 in the municipality of Fuenlabrada on the outskirts of Madrid, the capital.And near Barcelona, 208,000 antigen tests were stolen from a warehouse on New Year’s Eve. The criminal activity comes at a time when the shortage of test kits has prompted panic buying and long lines outside pharmacies and health care centers. Before Christmas, Spain’s health minister, Carolina Darias, warned that the shortage of tests had become a “maximum worry” amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. She said the spread of the variant had increased demand for tests by more than 1,000 percent in two weeks. On Monday, Spain reported about 35,000 new daily cases. The 14-day average case rate has climbed to almost 2,300 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In other news from around the world:  The economic recovery in New York will continue to lag that of the United States for years, with the city not expected to rebuild its labor force to prepandemic levels until late 2025, a year later than initially projected, according to a new economic forecast by the city’s Independent Budget Office. The report lays out a challenging road to recovery for New York, whose economy is underpinned by service industries closely tied to travel and tourism that collapsed at the start of the pandemic in spring 2020 and have been slow to recover. Parts of the city’s economy have thrived during the pandemic — Wall Street firms and lately, residential sales — but the course of the coronavirus will largely dictate how and when New York rebounds, the city agency said. The broader national economy has regained nearly all the jobs lost during the pandemic, but New York has regained only about 35 percent of its lost jobs in 2020, the report said. The prognosis also raises major questions about the impact of hybrid work on the value of office buildings, which pay a significant share of the city’s property taxes, and the future of brick-and-mortar retail, which was struggling even before the pandemic accelerated the move to online shopping. “The increasingly unpredictable nature of the spread of Covid-19 variants continues to confound economic forecasts and will remain one of — if not the primary — risk to the stability of the city’s financial plan,” the report said. The city government has avoided drastic cuts or tax increases because of $22 billion in federal aid for schools and city departments. The Independent Budget Office warned that the assistance has masked the true economic challenges confronting the city. The city’s economy is expected to grow 4.4 percent in 2022, fueled by a demand for workers, but slow considerably in the following years, the agency said. The city could have 4.694 million workers at the end of 2025, a slight increase from the 4.679 million workers at the end of 2019. But one key industry will take longer to recover: leisure and hospitality. By late 2025, the sector is projected to have 100,000 fewer employees than in late 2019 as tourism is slow to rebound and business travel is reduced significantly. A major source of income from tourism, the hotel occupancy tax, could reach $577 million in 2025, up from $85 million in 2021 but still below 2019 levels, the agency said. “With so many New York City residents’ employment and well-being directly tied to the tourism industry, even modest declines in tourism could have major impacts on the city’s economy,” the report said."

The police said that the teacher, Laura Parker Russo, administered a shot of what appeared to be a coronavirus vaccine to 17-year-old boy in her house in Sea Cliff, N.Y. The youth later went home and told his mother, who called the police and said she had not authorized the vaccination. Ms. Russo was charged with unauthorized practice of a profession, the police said. She has been removed from her classroom in the Herricks Public Schools system in New Hyde Park and reassigned pending the outcome of the investigation, schools officials said in a statement. A school website, which has been taken down, said Ms. Russo teaches at Herricks High School. Ms. Russo did not respond immediately to an email sent by The New York Times. She was released after her arrest and is scheduled to appear in criminal court on Jan. 21, the police said. Unauthorized practice of a profession is a felony under the state education law that carries a penalty of up to four years in prison. The majority of states, including New York, require parental consent for minors to receive Covid vaccinations. Some parents have prevented their children from getting inoculated for various reasons, including concerns about possible side effects and safety. Scientists say the vaccines are known to be safe for children 5 and older, and they urge vaccinating them because children can both spread the virus to others and become seriously ill themselves. The spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant has led to an increase in pediatric hospitalizations. And because broad immunity cannot be reached unless minors are vaccinated, federal and state officials hope that more parents will vaccinate their children, especially as many students return to school. Daily reports of new coronavirus cases have quadrupled in Nassau County over the past two weeks, according to The New York Times’s tracker. Hospitalizations in the county have risen 47 percent in that time. Seventy-six percent of Nassau County residents are vaccinated, according to The Times’s tracker, and the rate for 12- to 17-year-olds is only slightly lower, at 72 percent, according to state data. There is no statewide Covid vaccine mandate for schoolchildren in New York. But some private schools require vaccination, and New York City requires it for certain sports and extracurricular activities. In September, Los Angeles became the first school district to mandate vaccines for children 12 and older, with a deadline of Jan. 10, but those plans have since been delayed. The Washington, D.C., Council has voted to mandate vaccines for students 16 and older starting March 1. “This is a major source of tension between what is important for public health and what is important in terms of individual liberties and parental autonomy,” said Denis Nash, an epidemiologist at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. Schools require other vaccines for enrollment, like vaccination against measles. “That’s the big question: Does Covid-19 fall into the same category as some of these other vaccine preventable diseases that we do require for school entry, or does it not?” Dr. Nash said."

A 40-mile stretch of the highway — one of the busiest travel corridors in the United States — came to a standstill overnight after a fast-falling snowstorm led to jackknifed tractor-trailers and hundreds of other accidents. Some people abandoned their cars. Many, including a U.S. senator, spent the night on the snowy highway. As people spent a sleepless night in driver’s seats and truck cabs, state troopers slowly trudged from person to person, helping when they could with supplies. Tow trucks dragged car after disabled car out of the ice. “It’s been so horrible,” Arlin Tellez, 22, said in an interview on Tuesday morning from her car on the highway in Caroline County, Va., about 80 miles south of Washington. She had been trapped there since 5 p.m. Monday without any food or water, and was layering on clothes she had in the car. “There’s just no way for us to know what’s actually happening,” she said. “When we tried to call the police, because at this point that was our only resource, they literally just told us to hang on tight.” The interstate reopened on Tuesday night after Virginia state officials said that they had been working to clear several hundred vehicles off I-95. With slick roadways still possible, the Virginia Department of Transportation said drivers should avoid unnecessary travel overnight and on Wednesday morning. “We were prepared for the storm that was predicted — a few inches of snow — but instead, Mother Nature sent more than a foot of snow to the Fredericksburg area,” Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia said at a news conference on Tuesday afternoon.  The Virginia State Police said they had not received any reports of injuries or deaths related to the storm, but the authorities around the Mid-Atlantic said it had caused at least five deaths. Officials said the storm began on Monday with rain, which would have washed away road salts, and quickly overwhelmed efforts to keep the highway clear. Rain turned to sleet and then snow, which fell at a rate of two inches an hour for four to five hours, according to Marcie Parker, a Virginia Department of Transportation engineer. “That was entirely too much for us to keep up with,” she told reporters on Tuesday. Cars and trucks slowed, and then stopped, on their way up and down hills. At least one tractor-trailer slid sideways across the highway. In some places, Ms. Parker said, four inches of ice froze underneath vehicles. Corinne Geller, a spokeswoman for the Virginia State Police, said the authorities had responded to more than 1,000 traffic crashes and more than 1,000 disabled or stuck vehicles statewide. “We don’t believe that accounts for the vehicles on the 95 stretch,” she said. The snowstorm trapped truckers, students, families and every stripe of commuter, including Tim Kaine, the junior U.S. senator from Virginia and a former Democratic nominee for vice president. His ordeal began at about 1 p.m. on Monday, as his normal two-hour commute to the Capitol was disrupted by the gathering accidents and snow. “I’m extremely tired,” Mr. Kaine said in a phone interview on Tuesday afternoon as he arrived in Washington, having spent more than 20 hours stuck in his vehicle. “I had to sleep in my car last night on an ice-packed interstate with a ton of other cars.” He said he left his car on for 30 minutes at a time to charge his phone, make calls and warm up, then turned it off to save gas and to sleep for 20 minutes or so, only to be wakened by the cold. When he wasn’t napping, Mr. Kaine said, he passed the time by sipping Dr Pepper, listening to SiriusXM radio and eating small wedges of an orange that another stranded driver had given him. He said he regretted his habit of skipping breakfast. “I’m going to walk into the office right now, and I’m going to drink some water,” he said. “And I’m going to eat some potato chips or something salty, and I’m going to use a restroom.” Meera Rao and her husband, Raghavendra Rao, said they received notice about traffic conditions only after 15 hours in Caroline County. “I never thought I would be on a road near Washington, D.C., and not be able to move my vehicle an inch or two,” Mr. Rao said. Around 9 a.m. on Tuesday, someone cleared an exit near their car and they were able to move.  “We saw so many accidents ourselves, I was just praying for all of them,” Ms. Rao said. Jen Travis, a marketing agency owner from Sterling, Va., said she, her husband and their 12-year-old daughter got stuck near Fredericksburg, Va., around 2:30 a.m., as they were returning from a vacation at Universal Orlando Resort. Their road trip began after two canceled airline flights in Florida. Ms. Travis, 42, said the family had no food since they stopped for dinner around 7 p.m. on Monday, and that she had not gone to the bathroom since then, either. “I’m telling you, my bladder is about ready to burst,” she said. “Then we’re in the middle of Covid,” she added. “How do you walk up to a random house and say, ‘Can we use your bathroom? By the way, can you take a PCR test?’” Filling stations and convenience stores did steady business, at least once drivers were able to get to them. An employee who answered the phone at a Sheetz gas station in Woodford, Va., on Tuesday afternoon said customers had been streaming in — many on foot, having walked about a quarter-mile from the highway. “We don’t have much of anything left,” said the employee, who gave only his first name, Jason. Asked whether the station was out of fuel, he said, “We’re about to be.” The bad weather also disrupted rail traffic in Virginia. An Amtrak train that was on its way to New York from New Orleans returned to the station in Lynchburg, Va., after coming to a stop north of there on Monday, according to passengers who said they had been told that downed trees were blocking the tracks. Malcolm Kenton, who was on his way to Washington from Greensboro, N.C., said Amtrak gave passengers the choice of leaving when the train returned to Lynchburg. Mr. Kenton disembarked and spent the night at a hotel. “The train ran out of food at 6 p.m.,” he said. “It wasn’t officially announced, but we started hearing discussion that some of the toilets weren’t working. We just weren’t willing to risk having to spend the night on a train with no food and no working toilets.” The storm caused problems around the region, burying parts of Virginia in more than 15 inches of snow, and knocking out power for hundreds of thousands of customers in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee. Monday’s storm led to the deaths of at least five people. In Maryland, two women and a man died after their vehicle collided with a snow plow, according to the Montgomery County Police Department. Local news outlets in Tennessee and Georgia reported that a child in each state had died after trees fell onto their homes. As agencies worked to clear the roadways, drivers finally started to move. Marvin Romero, 34, an audio-video field engineer from Brooklyn, N.Y., said on Tuesday that he was driving with his two daughters, 10 and 8, back from a family vacation in Florida when they hit traffic around 3 p.m. on Monday in Virginia. From about 10 p.m. until Tuesday morning, his Hyundai Tucson compact S.U.V. did not move. At one point, Mr. Romero gave his daughters sparklers to pass the time. At another, he wrapped them in blankets while they slept. “I knew I couldn’t leave my car on all night,” Mr. Romero said. “I was worried about food, gas, my daughters. How are they going to sleep? The closest hotel to us walking was an hour away.” As of 1:45 p.m. on Tuesday, Mr. Romero said that he was moving again. He still had a long drive ahead of him, according to his GPS. “It’s telling me 1 o’clock in the morning right now,” he said. "

WASHINGTON — Behind closed doors inside a nondescript office building at the foot of Capitol Hill on a recent chilly morning, the House inquiry into the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol was in full swing. As congressional staff aides shuffled through the halls going about their normal business, investigators quietly pulled shades over the windows in conference rooms on several different floors and posted “Do Not Disturb” signs. In one such room sat Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of the Stop the Steal rallies with ties to far-right members of Congress who worked to help Donald J. Trump invalidate his 2020 election loss. A floor below was Kash Patel, a former Pentagon chief of staff involved in discussions about Capitol security. He had been in constant contact with Mr. Trump’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, on Jan. 6. Facing questions elsewhere in the building were John Eastman, a lawyer who plotted with Mr. Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election results; and Christopher Krebs, the Trump administration’s most senior cybersecurity official, who was fired after systematically dismantling Mr. Trump’s false declarations that the presidency had been stolen from him. The committee scrutinizing the pro-Trump mob attack has conducted much of its inquiry in private, drawing public attention mostly for the legal fights it is waging over access to evidence from Mr. Trump and some of his top lieutenants. But from a warren of offices in the O’Neill House Office Building in Southwest Washington, a few dozen investigators and members of Congress have ramped up a sprawling and elaborate investigation into the worst American attack on democracy in centuries. In recent weeks, with the anniversary of the riot looming on Thursday, the panel has redoubled its efforts in the face of mounting resistance from the former president. It is rushing to make as much progress as possible before January 2023. Republicans are favored to regain control of the House this fall, and if they do, that is when they would take power and almost certainly dissolve the inquiry. “We worked on Christmas and on New Year’s Day,” said Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the chairman of the committee. “The window for getting the job done requires weekends and holidays too. There’s a really firm commitment on the part of the staff to get it done.” Working in color-coded teams, investigators have interviewed more than 300 witnesses, from White House officials close to Mr. Trump to the rioters themselves, and are sorting through more than 35,000 documents. During its first three months, from July through September, the committee had fewer than 30 staff members and spent about $418,000, according to the latest documents filed with the House. Since then, the panel has increased its staff to about 40 and is looking to hire more investigators. Soon, the inquiry will enter a new phase, with plans to hold a series of public hearings in early spring to lay out some of its findings. Those will feature, among other topics, state election officials testifying to the security and accuracy of the 2020 election. A final report will be issued, “obviously before the November elections,” Mr. Thompson said. For now, the O’Neill building is the main hub of activity, where, depending on the day, the political operative Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, might appear outside flashing his signature Nixon-style “V for victory” sign to a sea of news cameras; or a lawyer for a Jan. 6 rally planner might arrive promoting a “treasure trove” of documents he says will leave senior Trump allies “quivering in their boots.” Reporters often dart up and down hallways trying to catch up to the various witnesses leaving the interview rooms. Inside, investigators and members of the nine-person committee are questioning witnesses, with the lawmakers — juggling busy schedules of floor votes and other congressional hearings — often bouncing between the interviews on a direct TV feed. “We are participating in the depositions and interviews regularly, and these are quite lengthy,” said Representative Elaine Luria, Democrat of Virginia and a member of the committee. “Even with other work that we have to do throughout the day, members are joining regularly to ask questions about specific areas.” The so-called green team is following the money trail connected to Mr. Trump’s efforts to promote the baseless assertion that he was the rightful winner of the election, including whether any groups defrauded contributors with false statements about widespread election fraud. The gold team is scrutinizing any plans Mr. Trump made with members of Congress to try to overturn the election and his pressure campaign on local, state and Justice Department officials to try to keep himself in power. Domestic violent extremist groups, such as the QAnon movement and the militia groups, the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, are the focus of the purple team. A fourth, the red team, is digging into the Jan. 6 rally planners and the Stop the Steal movement. The committee is led by Mr. Thompson and Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, who serves as vice chairwoman. Two of its top two investigators — both former U.S. attorneys — also come from different parties. Timothy J. Heaphy, whom President Barack Obama named U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia, is the Jan. 6 committee’s chief investigative counsel; and John Wood, whom President George W. Bush hired as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Missouri, is the committee’s senior investigative counsel. Mr. Wood, an ally of Ms. Cheney, is closely supervising the team focused on Mr. Trump’s direct involvement. One witness recently interviewed by the committee said arriving at the O’Neill building, a gleaming glass-encased behemoth, was like entering the British intelligence agency’s headquarters, with its modern lines and sterile feel. A congressional staffer escorted him up an elevator to a room with a U-shaped table and a large television on the wall. The TV had a live remote feed through which members of the committee could watch and listen. The witness said that before the deposition questioning began, he had been presented with a large binder full of evidence that investigators had collected on him. The lawyers conducting the inquiry were often “adversarial and hostile” in tone, he said, and were interested in the most minute details, even the moods and emotions of the people they were asking about. The committee appeared to be interested in a few key areas: any connections between the violence that took place on Jan. 6 and the group of political activists who planned the pro-Trump rallies that preceded it; any connections between the rally organizers and people in Mr. Trump’s orbit, including members of Congress; and any role that White House aides, Trump campaign officials and members of Mr. Trump’s family may have played in the putting the rallies together. “These are professionals — these are very skilled individuals who understand how to question witnesses to get to the truth,” Ms. Cheney said of the panel’s investigators. “It’s not all antagonistic. We’ve had the benefit of scores of people coming forward to say, ‘We’d like to help. We have suggestions for other people you should talk to.’” As they investigate, committee members are looking into whether a range of crimes were committed, including two in particular: whether there was wire fraud by Republicans who raised millions of dollars off assertions that the election was stolen, despite knowing the claims were not true; and whether Mr. Trump and his allies obstructed Congress by trying to stop its formal count of electoral votes. Recently, the committee has begun issuing subpoenas for bank records. Mr. Thompson said some of the financing of the rallies and advertisements that spread the misinformation about a stolen election could have run afoul of various federal laws. “We have several subpoenas in the queue,” Mr. Thompson said in an interview. The committee also is trying to obtain unreleased takes of Mr. Trump’s Jan. 6 video, in which he told rioters — hours into the violence — to go home, but also insisted that the election was stolen and fraudulent. “We love you. You’re very special,” Mr. Trump said to the rioters in the clip that was ultimately released. Witnesses have told investigators that Mr. Trump recorded other takes of the video, in which he did not tell the crowd to leave, that were never shown to the public. Mr. Thompson said these takes could shed light on his mindset at the time. “We need to know as a committee, why did it take so long, as this riot was going on at the Capitol, for you to say, ‘Stop?’ ” Mr. Thompson said of Mr. Trump. The panel’s investigators have not been slowed by the partisan infighting that sometimes takes place among committee staff on other congressional panels. Because Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, decided Republicans would not participate in the panel, there are no staff members in the interviews running interference for Mr. Trump. “We’re moving as swiftly as I think any congressional committee ever has,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, who led the first impeachment proceeding against Mr. Trump. But the panel is still facing a litany of lawsuits filed by Mr. Trump and his allies to try to block or slow down the committee’s subpoenas and document demands. Though the committee has interviewed hundreds of witnesses, some of the most crucial have yet to cooperate, Mr. Schiff said. “Some witnesses are far more important than others, and I think that some really important witnesses are attempting to deprive the committee and American people of what they know,” Mr. Schiff said. “There’s still some very significant witnesses and very significant documents we haven’t obtained.”"

Andrew M. Cuomo of New York will not be prosecuted in the criminal case involving allegations that he groped a former aide in the Executive Mansion in 2020, the Albany County district attorney announced on Tuesday. The announcement came on the heels of recent decisions by district attorneys in Nassau and Westchester Counties not to bring charges against Mr. Cuomo on other sexual misconduct allegations. And it brought to an end the only criminal charge thus far related to a blistering report from the state attorney general that led to his resignation in August. While the Albany district attorney said he was “deeply troubled” by allegations against Mr. Cuomo made by the former aide, Brittany Commisso, his statement underscored the difficulties of building a criminal case out of them.  “While many have an opinion regarding the allegations against the former governor, the Albany County D.A.’s Office is the only one who has a burden to prove the elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt,” David Soares, the Albany County district attorney, said in a statement. “While we found the complainant in this case cooperative and credible, after review of all the available evidence we have concluded that we cannot meet our burden at trial.” The move to drop the case in Albany came days before Mr. Cuomo was set to be arraigned in court on Friday. The Albany County sheriff’s office had filed a criminal complaint in October charging Mr. Cuomo with forcible touching, a misdemeanor sex crime that carries a penalty of up to one year in jail, but it had remained unclear whether Mr. Soares would pursue the case.  Prosecutors in Manhattan and in Oswego County are also known to be investigating other allegations from the report, but the most serious threat against Mr. Cuomo appeared to stem from Albany, where officials had accused him of forcible touching. The Manhattan district attorney has also closed without bringing charges an investigation into Mr. Cuomo’s handling of nursing home deaths toward the start of the pandemic, a lawyer for Mr. Cuomo who was briefed by prosecutors said on Monday. Mr. Soares’s decision, which was first reported by the Times Union of Albany, is the last chapter in an explosive case that was defined not just by its high-profile nature, but a string of missteps in the way it was handled, setting off tensions between the Albany sheriff and district attorney and leading to accusations from Mr. Cuomo’s camp that the case was politically motivated.  The complaint stemmed from allegations made by Ms. Commisso, a former executive assistant to Mr. Cuomo who said he groped her breast while they were alone in his private residence near the end of 2020.  “What he did to me was a crime,” Ms. Commisso told “CBS This Morning” and the Times Union in a joint interview last August. “It was not welcomed, and it was certainly not consensual.” Mr. Cuomo, a once-powerful Democrat who rose to national prominence for his leadership during the start of the coronavirus pandemic, resigned after becoming engulfed in scandal. Mr. Cuomo, who served as governor for more than a decade, repeatedly denied Ms. Commisso’s accusation and his lawyers mounted a vigorous defense seeking to undermine her account. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo declined to comment on Tuesday. Ms. Commisso’s lawyer, Brian Premo, said that she has “had no authority or voice’’ in the decision over the disposition of her case.  “I can confirm only that in this case my client had no control over the filing or prosecution of criminal charges,” he said. “The only thing she has any power over is her resolution to continue to speak the truth, and seek justice in an appropriate civil action, which she will do in due course.” The collapse of the various investigations into Mr. Cuomo, even though multiple entities that investigated him, from the State Assembly to local prosecutors, said they found his accusers to be believable, underscores the difficulty of pursuing cases of sexual misconduct in criminal court. The acting district attorney of Nassau County described a state trooper’s allegations that Mr. Cuomo had run his hand across her stomach to be “credible, deeply troubling, but not criminal under New York law.” Prosecutors in Westchester had looked at instances in which two women, including the trooper, said Mr. Cuomo had given them unwanted kisses on the cheek. Prosecutors in Albany would have had to clear a relatively high bar had they proceeded with the criminal charge, which required them to prove not only that Mr. Cuomo had touched Ms. Commisso, but that he did so with the intention of satisfying his own sexual desire, or of degrading her. Because cases like these rarely have irrefutable physical evidence, much of the burden would likely have fallen on Ms. Commisso’s testimony. Of the roughly 1,400 cases like Mr. Cuomo’s brought in a typical year across the state, almost four in 10 are dismissed or dropped, state criminal statistics show. That is in part because the standard used in criminal court — proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime has taken place — is the highest in the legal system, according to Deborah Tuerkheimer, a former Manhattan prosecutor and a law professor at Northwestern University who has written about sexual assault cases.  “Jurors bring with them a set of biases, misconceptions, and inaccurate understandings of abuse when they hear a case involving sexual violence,” she said. “Prosecutors often decide, rightly or wrongly, that the type of cross-examination that an accuser will face will make it unlikely for a juror to convict.” That can occur, she said, even in cases where a woman is deemed to be credible, a phenomenon Ms. Tuerkheimer described as a “credibility discount.” “They might say, we believe her, but we weren’t convinced beyond a reasonable doubt,” she said. The women who have accused Mr. Cuomo could still file lawsuits in civil court, where the threshold for liability is lower than in a criminal setting.  Legal hurdles aside, the case against Mr. Cuomo in Albany was riddled with controversy from the onset. It began when Ms. Commisso filed a complaint with Sheriff Craig D. Apple of Albany County shortly after Letitia James, the attorney general, released her report on Aug. 3. The report concluded that Mr. Cuomo had sexually harassed multiple women, including Ms. Commisso. Sheriff Apple’s office investigated Ms. Commisso’s account and, nearly three months later, on Oct. 28, filed criminal charges against Mr. Cuomo in Albany City Court, describing the case against him as “very solid.”  He did so, however, without consulting Ms. Commisso or coordinating with Mr. Soares’s office, which would be tasked with prosecuting the case. The decision by Sheriff Apple was as unusual as it was unexpected, especially in a high-stakes case involving a former governor, and it was seen by some as a tactic to make headlines or pressure Mr. Soares, who was caught off guard, into pursuing the case. Mr. Soares, however, did not commit to doing so. In early November, he wrote a letter to the judge overseeing the case saying that the complaint filed by the sheriff’s office was “potentially defective,” and that he would need more time to finish his own investigation into Mr. Cuomo. Judge Holly Trexler of Albany City Court granted his request, and postponed Mr. Cuomo’s arraignment, originally scheduled for Nov. 17, until Jan. 7. As the court date loomed, Mr. Cuomo’s team continued to question the integrity of the case, suggesting that politics may have played a role, and noting that Sheriff Apple had filed the complaint the same week that Ms. James, whom Mr. Cuomo has blamed for his demise, declared her candidacy for governor. (Ms. James, who dropped out of the race last month, has said the timing of the announcements was purely coincidental.) One concern for prosecutors, beyond the high burden of proof, may have been the fact that there was initially confusion around the date that Ms. Commisso said Mr. Cuomo touched her inappropriately, a discrepancy Mr. Cuomo’s lawyers seized on to cast her account as faulty. She initially told investigators it had happened in November 2020, but that she could not be sure of the exact date. Relying on records that documented her presence in the Executive Mansion, investigators later determined, and Ms. Commisso agreed, that the incident had likely occurred on Dec. 7. "

Ben Smith said in an interview that they planned to build a global newsroom that broke news and experimented with new formats of storytelling. He did not provide details on what beats or regions would be covered, how much money they planned to raise or when the new organization would start. “There are 200 million people who are college educated, who read in English, but who no one is really treating like an audience, but who talk to each other and talk to us,” said Ben Smith, who is not related to Justin Smith. “That’s who we see as our audience.” Justin Smith, 52, will lead the business side, and Ben Smith, 45, will be the top editor of the new venture. Ben Smith joined the Times in 2020 after an eight-year tenure as editor in chief of BuzzFeed. He was previously a reporter at Politico. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Justin Smith was leaving Bloomberg to found the news start-up. Ben Smith said that he and Justin Smith had been discussing the fractured state of the news media for years, and began talking about starting a new company last fall. The new venture, he said, would aim to break news and offer nuance to complex stories, without falling into familiar partisan tropes. “The pressures of social media and polarization have a lot of news organizations talking down to their audience,” he said. Ben Smith also suggested that the new venture would focus on elevating the profiles of individual journalists. “The talent model for journalism is pretty broken,” he added. “Audiences feel really connected to the person writing the story or making the video. That’s a challenge for big institutions.” In a tweet announcing his departure from Bloomberg, Justin Smith said he was leaving “to pursue a personal dream, and a market opportunity.” In his column for The Times, Ben Smith wrote a number of major articles, including one about harassment and abuse of power allegations against the chief editor of Bild, one of Germany’s most powerful newspapers, which is owned by Axel Springer, a giant global media company. His column raising questions about the business practices of Ozy Media and its founder, Carlos Watson, rocked a start-up that had claimed it had large online audiences. “What makes Ben special is that he is a commentator who also deeply reports,” Dean Baquet, executive editor of the Times, said in a statement. “That’s a pretty rare combination in media writing today.” At times, Mr. Smith was accused of having conflicts of interest while reporting on the media business, because he had stock in BuzzFeed when he joined The Times. In an interview, Mr. Smith said he had divested most of that stock. Mr. Smith took over the media column at The Times from Jim Rutenberg. Before Mr. Rutenberg, the columnist position was held for years by David Carr, who died in 2015. Mr. Smith has experience building a newsroom. He was hired by Jonah Peretti in 2012 to start BuzzFeed’s news division. When he left for The Times in 2020, Mr. Peretti credited him with turning BuzzFeed from a digital news start-up into “a world-class, global news organization in less than a decade.” BuzzFeed News was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in international reporting in 2018 for its work investigating operatives with apparent ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia engaging in targeted killings in Britain and the United States. In 2017, it was a finalist for the Pulitzer in international reporting for detailing how multinational corporations undermined environmental laws. In January 2017, Mr. Smith was also the first editor to publish an unverified dossier containing salacious reports about President Donald J. Trump compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer, during the 2016 presidential campaign. The decision to publish was hotly debated in the political and media worlds. Most of the important claims in the dossier have not been proven and some have been refuted, including by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who oversaw the inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Justin Smith joined Bloomberg in 2013 and helped push the news organization into live events and video. “Justin helped transform Bloomberg Media into a modern, digital, media industry leader,” Michael Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg, said in a statement. Before Bloomberg, he worked at Atlantic Media, where he started the business news site Quartz.  "

That milestone underlines the changes shaking automakers, which face strong competition and external forces as they move into electric vehicles. And it came in a tumultuous and strange  year in which automakers contended with an accelerating shift to electric vehicles and struggled with profound manufacturing challenges. New car sales have been damped by a severe shortage of computer chips that forced automakers to idle plants even though demand for cars has been incredibly robust. G.M., Ford Motor and Stellantis, the automaker created by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, produced and sold fewer cars than they had hoped to in 2021 because they were hit hard by the chip shortage. Toyota was not hurt as much. In addition to that shortage, the coronavirus pandemic and related supply-chain problems depressed sales while driving up the prices of new and used cars, sometimes to dizzying heights. Auto manufacturers sold just under 15 million new vehicles in 2021, according to estimates by Cox Automotive, which tracks the industry. That is 2.5 percent more than in 2020 but well short of the 17 million vehicles the industry usually sold in a year before the pandemic took hold. G.M. said on Tuesday that its U.S. sales slumped 13 percent in 2021, to 2.2 million trucks and cars. Toyota had access to more chips because it set aside larger stockpiles of parts after an earthquake and tsunami in Japan knocked out production of several key components in 2011. Its 2021 sales rose more than 10 percent, to 2.3 million. “The dominance of the U.S. automakers of the U.S. market is just over,” said Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who follows the auto industry. “Toyota might not beat G.M. again this year, but the fact that they did it is symbolic of how the industry changed. No U.S. automaker can think of themselves as entitled to market share just because they’re American.” Ford is expected to finish third when the company releases sales data on Wednesday. The shortage of chips stems from the beginning of the pandemic, when auto plants around the world closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. At the same time, sales of computers and other consumer electronics took off. When automakers resumed production, they found fewer chips available to them. Despite weak new-vehicle sales, automakers and dealers alike have been ringing up hefty profits because they have been able to raise prices. “Sales volumes are down but our margins are up and expenses are down,” said Rick Ricart, whose family owns Ford, Hyundai, Kia and other dealerships around Columbus, Ohio. “We barely had any inventory cost now. Cars arrive on the truck and they’re already sold. They’re gone within 24 to 48 hours.” Automakers are also contending with the transition to electric cars and trucks. Many companies are spending tens of billions of dollars designing battery-powered models and building plants to produce them. They are racing to catch up to Tesla, which sells a large majority of electric vehicles now. But most established automakers are unlikely to gain ground in U.S. electric vehicle sales this year because they are not in a position to produce many tens of thousands of such cars for at least another year or two. And Tesla, which was founded in 2003, is not standing still. After reporting a nearly 90 percent jump in global sales last year, to just shy of one million, the company plans to start mass production at two new factories this year, near Austin, Texas, and Berlin. It has been less affected by the chip shortage because it was able to switch to types of chips that are more readily available. The electric-car maker does not break out sales by country, but Cox Automotive estimated that it sold more than 330,000 in the United States, or roughly as many vehicles as Mercedes-Benz and BMW each sold here. Ford is perhaps the only major automaker that could pose a serious competitive threat to Tesla this year. This spring, Ford plans to start selling an electric version of its F-150 pickup truck, the top-selling vehicle in the United States. The company has taken more than 200,000 reservations for that truck, the F-150 Lightning, and hopes to produce more than 50,000 this year. It is increasing production at a plant near Detroit to build 80,000 in 2023 and up to 150,000 in 2024. “The F-150 is the most important franchise in our company,” Kumar Galhotra, president of Ford’s Americas and international markets group, said in an interview. “The F-150 Lightning shows how serious our commitment is to the E.V. market.” Ford has been selling a popular electric sport-utility vehicle, the Mustang Mach E, for nearly a year. It said Tuesday that it aimed to increase production of the Mach E to 200,000 vehicles a year by 2023. Other automakers are planning to produce relatively modest numbers of electric cars this year because they and their suppliers are still gearing up to build factories and produce batteries and other components. G.M. has set a goal of producing only electric vehicles by 2035, and on Wednesday it will unveil a battery-powered Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck at the Consumer Electronics Show. But the electric Silverado isn’t expected to go into production until 2023. G.M. has also had to suspend production of its main electric vehicle, the Chevrolet Bolt, because of a manufacturing defect that can cause its battery to catch fire. In the last three months of the year, the company sold just 25 Bolts. The U.S. auto industry has long been defined by G.M., which has held the top spot on annual sales rankings for nearly a century after it sped past Ford in the late 1920s and early ’30s. Toyota started selling cars in the United States in 1965. It began production at its first U.S. plant in Georgetown, Ky., in 1988, building a reputation for quality as G.M., Ford and Chrysler struggled. Its growth also raised trade tensions between the United States and Japan and gave rise to popular fears that Japanese businesses would decimate American companies. Toyota then expanded into luxury cars with its Lexus brand, and added the Toyota Tundra full-size pickup truck to compete in a segment dominated by the manufacturers based in and around Detroit. By the beginning of this century, the Toyota Camry was often the top-selling car in the country, and the Japanese automaker soon passed Chrysler and Ford in annual sales. Its image was further enhanced when it introduced the Prius hybrid as gasoline prices were rising and consumers were focusing more on fuel economy. The company still dominates sales of hybrid vehicles, which couple gasoline engines with batteries and electric motors. But Toyota has been slower to embrace fully electric vehicles, which could undercut its growth in the coming years. At an event last month, the company’s president, Akio Toyoda, stood in front a row of prototype E.V.s and outlined a plan to significantly ramp up production of such cars by 2030. But Toyota is also now contending with supply chain problems. In recent months, the company has had to sharply slow production around the world as it has exhausted its chip stockpile and had to wait for its suppliers to make more."

The doll, named Corinne Tan, is 18 inches tall and comes with an interesting back story: She is a powerhouse skier from Aspen, Colo., who is building the courage to respond to “xenophobic comments,” the company said in a statement last week. Corinne’s story may be fiction, but the comments are not. Violence against Asian Americans has swelled during the pandemic, largely perpetrated by those who tied the coronavirus to China. That is why many Asian Americans have hailed Corinne as an important — and, perhaps, overdue — step by American Girl to teach children about anti-Asian racism. The company’s “Girl of the Year” dolls, which have been rolling out since 2001, are meant to respond to “the realities of the times — both good and bad,” a company spokeswoman said on Monday. “We knew it was important for Corinne’s story to show the unfortunate rise in anti-Asian sentiment across the U.S. since the pandemic,” the spokeswoman said. The company hoped that the doll would validate the experiences of children who have endured racism, while also inspiring children to be “antiracism allies,” the spokeswoman added. In 2017, the “Girl of the Year” doll was Black; in 2018, it was Chilean. Racism in the United States has often translated into children’s toy boxes, where dolls were traditionally white. Children can derive meaningful lessons from their toys, which is why some in the toy industry have long pushed for more diverse dolls. Over the years, toy analysts and parents of Asian children have said that Asian dolls have been among the scarcest, making Corinne a somewhat unusual decision by American Girl. Of the company’s roughly 60 dolls, six, including Corinne, have been of Asian descent, another American Girl spokeswoman said. The company discontinued its only other Chinese American doll, Ivy Ling, in 2014, prompting an outcry from parents. In 2006 and 2011, the “Girl of the Year” dolls were partially of Asian descent, the company said. American Girl has built an empire off its dolls, which have been an enduring phenomenon since the company was founded in 1986. Children have clamored for the dolls — which cost upward of $100 — not just for the toys themselves, but also for the adventure they bring. American Girl stores offer “spas” and “hair salons” where children can curl their doll’s hair or put cucumbers on their eyes. Parents often do not mind the price, because the dolls and their back stories have been used to explain difficult subjects, including divorce, war and economic hardship. In addition to racism, Corinne’s back story explores blended families. Her parents are separated, and she is learning to live with a new stepfather, the company said. Her story was written by the author Wendy Wan-Long Shang. “What I really hope is that there is some part of Corinne’s story that makes readers feel seen,” Ms. Shang said in a statement. When Corinne debuted last week, American Girl said it was donating $25,000 to AAPI Youth Rising, an organization that teaches students about anti-Asian xenophobia. Corinne went on sale last week and will be sold for two years “at minimum,” the company said. Some Twitter users expressed excitement over the doll and applauded the communities it represented. “This makes me very proud,” one user wrote. “Finally after years of waiting — far into adulthood, this happens.” Corinne, who has a little sister, has her detractors, however. Some Twitter users have criticized the blue streaks in the doll’s hair, which have sometimes been used to indicate that an Asian woman is rebellious. Others have commented on how heavy Corinne’s story is, since she learns about divorce and racism at such a young age. It is indeed a tough childhood for Corinne. On the American Girl website, it says that she has to learn “how to stand up to racist bullies,” including when a boy tells her she has “Kung Flu,” a racist characterization of Covid-19 used by former President Donald J. Trump. The website added, “Corinne is proud to be Chinese American, but racism leaves her tongue-tied.”"

The case was not open-and-shut. Jurors, after a 15-week trial, returned a mixed verdict, finding Holmes guilty on four of 11 charges. All of the counts that she was convicted of related to defrauding investors. She was found not guilty of four counts of defrauding patients, and jurors were unable to agree on three counts related to financial fraud. Holmes is likely to spend time in prison, with each count carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years, which could be served concurrently. A sentencing date is expected to be set next week at a hearing about the three hung charges. Holmes can appeal the conviction, her sentence or both. She is currently on probation and exited the courtroom in San Jose, Calif. via a side door. She is unlikely to receive the maximum sentence because she has no criminal record, but she could face a long time behind bars because of the amount of money she raised — some $945 million in investments in Theranos were eventually wiped out. American courts are notoriously lenient on white-collar criminals, and such cases are rare in Silicon Valley. The tech news site The Information argued that there was no point imprisoning Holmes because investors would never back her again and the U.S. already incarcerates too many people. On the other hand, a light sentence would stand in contrast to the harshness that many less privileged defendants face, while a tough sentence could act as a deterrent to others to cut out fraud, which can be a byproduct of Silicon Valley’s “fake it till you make it” philosophy. And the fact that Holmes was found guilty of defrauding investors, and not customers, may send a message about the state of financial regulation and enforcement, which since the financial crisis has been criticized by some as too lenient. More on the verdict: Evergrande shares reopen higher. After trading was halted yesterday, the embattled Chinese real estate developer said today that its contracted sales fell nearly 39 percent last year. Missing was any update on the company’s financial restructuring efforts. OPEC and its allies are set to raise oil production. The cartel of petroleum-producing countries and partners like Russia are expected to announce today that they will modestly increase output by about 400,000 barrels a day. That’s in part because the group sees a smaller-than-expected global oil surplus. Apple hits the $3 trillion mark. The iPhone maker became the first public company to reach that stratospheric valuation, after hitting $2 trillion just 16 months ago. The company’s in-demand products and shrewd use of cash (in part to buy back its shares) have propelled its stock price higher. Tesla opens a showroom in China’s Xinjiang. The move came despite many Western countries’ shying away from the region after accusing Beijing of repressing Muslim ethnic minorities there. But Tesla relies heavily on China for sales growth. So-so performance dims hedge funds’ allure. The industry reported an average gain of 8.7 percent for most of last year, badly trailing the S&P 500. (Some firms, like D.E. Shaw and Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square, reported far stronger results.) That, coupled with investor concerns about high fees, has made it harder for funds to attract new capital. The nation’s largest wireless companies, reversing their stance, said yesterday that they would delay a planned expansion of 5G technology. Verizon and AT&T said the service would provide many more customers with superfast connections, but airline officials warned that 5G could risk safety and make a spate of canceled and delayed flights worse. The Transportation Department and the Federal Aviation Administration asked last week for the companies to delay the release, which Verizon and AT&T initially rejected. What’s the problem? 5G uses a neighboring frequency to altimeters, devices that show pilots on takeoffs and landings how far they are from the ground. The concern is that wireless 5G traffic will bump into signals being sent by altimeters, giving pilots inaccurate altitude readings — or none at all. To prevent that, the agency had warned it may be forced to divert aircraft away from airports where planes could face interference. Experts say airlines are most likely overstating the risk. Pilots rely on altimeters only in dense fog and other weather conditions that produce low visibility and not on most landings. And modern jetliners have altimeters that would not be disrupted by neighboring frequencies. So, it’s the airlines that fly smaller or older planes that would be affected the most. “I can’t imagine we would see massive flight disruptions,” Tim Farrar, a wireless spectrum expert and industry consultant, told DealBook. A compromise could be in the works. The transportation agency has hinted that it is likely to exempt newer planes from 5G-related restrictions, and the wireless industry may be willing to help pay to make older planes 5G compliant. Farrar estimates that this would cost a few hundred million dollars, which isn’t much considering that wireless providers paid nearly $100 billion to acquire 5G spectrum. More spectrum fights are on the way. While the Federal Communications Commission doles out wireless frequencies, industry regulators like the F.A.A. get a lot of say in how those frequencies are used. When there is a conflict, regulators are not required to come up with a joint solution. “There isn’t a year without a dozen spectrum fights,” said Jon Peha, a Carnegie Mellon professor and a former F.C.C. official. “It will continue until the underlying broken process is fixed.” — Thomas Philippon, an economist at New York University who studies corporate concentration, says he believes unique economic conditions resulting from the pandemic have led to high inflation. The White House has blamed consolidation and a lack of competition in the beef industry for rising food prices, joining a chorus of criticism from Democrats. Bridgewater Associates, the world’s biggest hedge fund, named two new C.E.O.s yesterday after David McCormick, its current chief, said he would step down to consider a run for the U.S. Senate. Meet Nir Bar Dea and Mark Bertolini. Bar Dea, 40, is Bridgewater’s deputy C.E.O. and a former Israeli military major who was in charge of the firm’s pandemic planning; Bertolini, 65, is the former chief of the insurer Aetna and a Bridgewater board member. Their unconventional backgrounds for leaders of a hedge fund reflect the firm’s unusual culture, including a commitment to “radical transparency.” Ray Dalio, Bridgewater’s outspoken founder, will stay on as co-chief investment officer. They will succeed McCormick, a former U.S. Army captain, McKinsey consultant and official in the George W. Bush administration. He joined Bridgewater in 2009 — Dalio told employees yesterday that he initially gave him a “50 percent chance of working out” — and eventually rose to the firm’s top spot. “Dave took Bridgewater from where it was to where it is,” Dalio said. “That was no easy job.” McCormick’s new challenge may be tougher. The conservative Republican will be entering a crowded field for the Pennsylvania Senate seat, which includes the reality TV star Dr. Mehmet Oz. His advisers reportedly include former Trump administration officials like Hope Hicks and Stephen Miller. The tools presented to combat the coronavirus crisis have often led to political strife and aggravated existing divides. First it was masks, then vaccines and now tests.

140,The New York Times,nytimes,"Police in Spain released a video showing the seizure of 300,000 unauthorized antigen tests from a warehouse on Dec. 29. They are continuing to investigate major cases of theft or the illegal trafficking of Covid test kits amid a serious shortage of tests. https://nyti.ms/3qQScTE",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3JGmbGI%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3c5T6gO89-MIH9r_QTuF8jsE52qXoGtpVC93jBMp2quDzQ4ZE4lP6Kpl8&h=AT0Psx_tJyAhZWZD--SRt3SpA_bwR9aAfux3GtzlJg4WUHdIqmkjM-8STFOs9iQWENozWxr7s1hF-NWDe2qDoyTLHHicEZRlrTkvmISgbiXaYqdpP_ow5B3eBhecp4z4LY-6rJrByuEu2xOVhBJC&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT0OVskOs4T5fzIMe438b9PHdH28f1s2OKT6rIJvvFqO-9H3Euqeq_kCnLsgP7PUvOx1Gye_XrYLwfTIk3NBqbNy-tvWd6EkNn2aVWjvJILLgMu1bU7L-suUakcJR_PwbqBOSWo1nRcd7Opc12WAx49ra3ZUsLU1IaExsoGRiZPbhFuF,2d,"The number of Americans quitting their jobs is the highest on record, as workers take advantage of strong employer demand to pursue better opportunities. More than 4.5 million people voluntarily left their jobs in November, the Labor Department said Tuesday. That was up from 4.2 million in October and was the most in the two decades that the government has been keeping track. The surge in quitting in recent months — along with the continuing difficulty reported by employers in filling openings — underscores the strange, contradictory moment facing the U.S. economy after two years of pandemic-induced disruptions. Much of the discussion about the increase in quitting, sometimes referred to as the Great Resignation, has focused on white-collar workers re-evaluating their priorities in the pandemic. But job turnover has been concentrated in hospitality and other low-wage sectors, where intense competition for employees has given workers the leverage to seek better pay. “This Great Resignation story is really more about lower-wage workers finding new opportunities in a reopening labor market and seizing them,” said Nick Bunker, director of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab. For some workers, the rush to reopen the economy has created a rare opportunity to demand better pay and working conditions. But for those who can’t change jobs as easily, or who are in sectors where demand isn’t as strong, pay gains have been more modest, and have been overwhelmed by faster inflation. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta shows that job-switchers are getting significantly faster pay increases than people who stay in their jobs. Faster pay increases and faster inflation are both at least partly a result of the remarkable strength of the economic recovery. After collapsing in the first weeks of the pandemic, consumer spending quickly rebounded and eventually reached record levels, helped by hundreds of billions of dollars in federal aid. Businesses, whipsawed by the sudden reversals, struggled to keep up with demand, leading to supply chain snarls, labor shortages and rising prices. The stubborn nature of the pandemic itself contributed to the problems, upending spending patterns and keeping workers on the sidelines. There are signs that the worst of the turbulence was beginning to ease late last year. The number of job openings posted by employers fell in November, the Labor Department said Tuesday, though it remained high by historical standards. Hiring picked up, too. Earlier data showed that more people returned to the labor force in November, and various measures of supply-chain pressures have begun to ease. But that was before the explosion in coronavirus cases linked to the Omicron variant, which has forced airlines to cancel flights, businesses to delay return-to-office plans and school districts to return temporarily to remote learning. Forecasters say the latest Covid-19 wave is all but certain to prolong the economic uncertainty, though it is too soon to say how it will affect inflation, spending or the job market. Despite the demand for workers and the pay increases landed by some, Americans are pessimistic about the economy. Only 21 percent of adults said their finances were better off than a year ago, according to a survey released Tuesday — down from 26 percent when the question was asked a year earlier, even though, by most measures, the economy had improved substantially during that period. The survey of 5,365 adults was conducted last month for The New York Times by Momentive, the online research firm formerly known as SurveyMonkey. Overall consumer confidence is at the lowest level in the nearly five years Momentive has been conducting its survey. Republicans have been particularly pessimistic about the economy since President Biden took office a year ago, but in recent months, Democrats, too, have become more dour. Other surveys have found similar results. Inflation appears to be a big reason for people’s dark outlook. Most respondents in the Momentive survey said inflation had not yet had a major effect on their finances. But nearly nine in 10 said they were at least “somewhat concerned” about inflation, and six in 10 said they were “very concerned.” Worries about inflation cross generational, racial and even partisan lines: 95 percent of Republicans, 88 percent of independents and 82 percent of Democrats say they are concerned. “Pretty much the only group of people who say they’re better off now than they were a year ago are people who’ve gotten a pay raise that matches or beats inflation,” said Laura Wronski, a research scientist at Momentive. There aren’t many of them. Only 17 percent of workers say they have received raises that kept up with inflation over the past year. Most of the rest say either that they have received raises that lagged price increases or that they have received no raise at all; 8 percent of respondents said they had taken a pay cut. Government data likewise shows that, in the aggregate, prices have risen faster than pay in recent months: The Consumer Price Index rose 6.8 percent in November, a nearly four-decade high; average hourly earnings rose 4.8 percent in November, and other measures likewise show pay gains lagging price increases. Yet some workers are seeing much faster wage growth. Hourly earnings for leisure and hospitality workers were up 12.3 percent in November, much faster than inflation. Workers in other low-wage service sectors are also seeing strong gains. In the Momentive survey, respondents who reported voluntarily changing jobs during the pandemic were more likely to say their wages had kept up with inflation, and more likely to rate the economy highly overall. Those who were laid off during the pandemic, or who have kept the same job throughout, were less likely to say their wages had kept pace. Somer Welch, a 40-year-old survey respondent in Maine, lost her job in the pandemic when the brewpub where she worked shut down. She has since found a job at another restaurant, but her earnings haven’t fully rebounded. Her husband, who works at a local ship builder, has kept his job throughout the pandemic, other than a brief furlough, but he hasn’t gotten a raise. The result: The family is losing ground relative to inflation. “The cost of things rose, our rent increased, while our income decreased,” Ms. Welch said. The couple was able to build up some savings early in the pandemic, but that rainy-day fund has been largely depleted. “The rainy day came a lot sooner than we expected,” she said. Ms. Welch isn’t ready to join the ranks of the quitters. She likes her job and its flexible hours. But she knows there are better-paying jobs out there, she said, and she will consider making a move if rising prices make it hard to afford basic needs for her four-person family. Workers like Ms. Welch might have leverage in theory, said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at the career site Glassdoor. But to take advantage of that leverage, they have to be willing to use it. “At a time when employers are competing and raising wages so quickly, if you’re not switching jobs right now then you can get left behind by the market,” Mr. Zhao said. Mr. Zhao said it wasn’t clear whether concerns about inflation were directly contributing to people’s decision to switch jobs. But mentions of “inflation” in reviews on Glassdoor by companies’ current or former employees were up 385 percent in December from a year ago."

A loud, sour-sounding horn bleated, piercing through the noise of the crowd, whose cries coalesced into an accusatory chant: “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” Edwards, who is 5-foot-4, tried to make herself look imposing. Behind a row of bike racks, alongside four other officers, she stood in a wide stance, her hands on her hips. A man in front of her whipped off his jacket as if he were getting ready for something, flipped his red MAGA hat backward — and then the rioters were pushing the bike racks forward as the officers pushed back, trying to hold their balance. A sergeant standing closer to the Capitol looked over just in time to see a bike rack heaved up and onto Edwards, whom he recognized by her tied-back blond hair. She crumpled to the ground, head hitting concrete, the first officer down in what would prove to be a bloody, bruising battle, the worst assault on the Capitol since 1814, when the British burned the building. The crowd howled and roared, rushing past the barricade as that sergeant started screaming into the radio orders to lock all Capitol doors. Edwards’s blue cap had been knocked from her head. Once she got back on her feet, she stood, dazed and leaning on a railing for support, her hair loose and disheveled, as rioters flung themselves past the barriers, her colleagues punching back the few they could. Officers around the building heard, over the radio, an anguished call distinct from any other they had encountered on the job: “Help!”  On the other side of the Capitol, Harry Dunn, a 6-foot-7 former college football player, thought he recognized that voice. It sounded to him like Edwards, an officer he’d trained, someone whom more officers than seemed possible considered a close personal friend, including Dunn. He started running toward the west front. Inside, near the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center, Devan Gowdy was putting on his riot gear when he heard that same call for help — frantic and high-pitched — and then his unit was sprinting through the building, down two flights of stairs and out a door on the west front of the building. Gowdy, blinking, took in a scene that seemed to have been spliced in from some other, unfamiliar world: A crowd of thousands raged before him. Standing on a small wooden stage built for the inauguration, he felt as if he’d been performing for a murderous, violent audience as people started throwing cans, paintballs, bolts, bottles fizzing with hydrogen peroxide. One rioter he saw was wielding a hatchet with the American flag wrapped around the blade. Many officers who worked riot control knew, from experience, to take their name tags off before heading into the fray, but Gowdy, a slender 27-year-old with nearly three years on the force, had left his on. “Hey, Gowdy! Look at Gowdy!” a rioter screamed. “Gowdy! Gowdy, you’re scared!” another jeered. One of Gowdy’s sergeants, Aquilino Gonell, a 42-year-old veteran of the war in Iraq, who was close by, unable to move from his position lest the crowd burst through, heard the taunts and was chilled to the bone. Gowdy looked at him beseechingly, but what could he do? Gonell saw a rioter pull hard at the shield in Gowdy’s hand, the two of them rocking back and forth. Gonell thought his officer was hit hard in the head with his own shield; Gowdy only knows that a flagpole clattered to his feet just after he felt a blow. Another officer pulled him back to safety inside the building. Amid the chaos, Gonell lost track of the other members of his unit, a tight-knit crew that usually worked the midnight shift. Soon he was one of a few officers near the lower west entrance to the building who still had a shield — other officers had either lost theirs in battle or never had one in the first place — and was bracing himself in the doorway, barely holding on. A rioter smashed his hand with a baton. Gonell slipped on a pile of shields wet with toxic spray and feared that the rioters, grabbing his leg, his shield, his arm, would pull him apart before he was somehow able to right himself. Edwards had gathered herself and spent more than an hour — or was it days, time lost all sense — fighting off rioters or helping other officers on the lower west terrace of the Capitol. She was positioned near a friend from her shift, Brian Sicknick, when they were hit with chemical spray directly in their faces. Edwards’s hands flew to her eyes as she bowed down in pain and stumbled. Sicknick retreated to wash out his eyes, then returned to the fight. Another officer escorted Edwards, her lungs searing from toxic spray, away from the scene to get medical treatment. Anton, a 34-year-old Navy veteran in Gonell’s unit, had been ordered, along with the rest of the officers on the west front, to retreat into the Capitol. Inside, a friend grabbed his tactical vest, screaming, “They’re in the building!” They realized that if the rioters came down the interior stairs near the lower west terrace entrance, they would attack, from behind, Gonell and other officers who were fending off the crowd at that door. Anton (who asked to be identified by only his middle name to protect his privacy) ran up two flights, using his shield to shove clusters of rioters back up the stairs. Arriving two floors up, at the Rotunda, amid paintings of American generals courteously accepting their enemies’ surrender, he joined a melee that was savage, without rules or limits. By then, the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police had arrived in force as allies in the fight, its only audience the presidential statues encircling the room: a beaming Ronald Reagan, a fierce Andrew Jackson, Dwight Eisenhower in a pose of resolve. Anton took none of it in: He was punching, his fists bloody, hitting men, women, equipment, trying to push the crowd back. Even as he fought, his mind was flooding with questions: Was he going to die here? And if he did, would these demonic faces be the last thing he saw? What would it take for him to actually use his gun? And — what the hell happened to Hoyte? He had been separated from his friend, Lennox Hoyte, a 32-year-old U.S. Army veteran who served in the military police in Afghanistan. Only later did Anton learn, stricken with guilt, just how badly the day had gone for him. Hoyte was pulled into the crowd, yanked so hard that his gear ripped. Someone beat his hand with a pipe; another rioter swung a piece of scaffolding at him before he was able to tear himself free. He ended up trapped with another officer in an enclosure beneath the inaugural stage, its doors, embedded with electric circuitry, serving as their barricade. Injured, he spent hours there surrounded by a mob that kept trying to break through those doors, unable to leave as chemical spray rained down between the planks of wood overhead. Another friend, Dominick Tricoche, was off duty but drove to the Capitol after a fellow officer texted the unit’s group chat saying something serious was underway at the Capitol. Fighting, plunging into the crowd to try to help another officer who had been swarmed, he wept chemically induced tears, as if his body’s physical reaction matched the grief and terror he felt in a crowd he was certain wanted to kill him. His eyes felt as if they were merely receptacles for pain; even the air seemed to be on the attack. “Traitor! Traitor!” the rioters chanted, as someone flung a bike rack at him and he fell down a flight of stone stairs. The stone, slick and slippery with blood and tear gas, was punishing: An officer on the west front, a large man with a beard, fell hard on the stairs and was out cold for three minutes. A friend threw himself over that man’s body to protect his gun, his own hand breaking amid the trampling horde. Dunn, when he rushed to the west front, found that he could not make his way through the crowd to find Edwards. He tried to help hold the line by the western lawn, positioned high above the crowd, his rifle aimed at a mob throwing smoke bombs and waving Confederate and Thin Blue Line flags. Like nearly every armed officer that day, he held his fire, out of restraint but also fear: How many rioters would fire right back? The police were clearly outnumbered. Back inside the building, Dunn positioned himself on the floor below the Rotunda, stopping rioters who were trying to get past him to an area where officers were recovering. Once Gonell was able to retreat inside, he was relieved to see Dunn. Gonell’s left shoulder was badly injured, but he was using that arm to try to help transport Rosanne Boyland, a member of the crowd who had lost consciousness and had no pulse. Dunn joined Gonell and others as they carried Boyland upstairs so she could be administered CPR (she would later be pronounced dead). By early evening, with the help of the Metropolitan Police, the Capitol Police had all but cleared the building, and the National Guard had finally arrived. Officers downstairs in the Crypt were on their knees in the hallway, racked with coughs, or standing bereft in a long line for the bathroom, which was crowded with colleagues trying to soothe their searing eyes. When Anton saw Tricoche, he looked as if he had been dipped in a vat of flour, covered in the residue of all that chemical spray. Anton was taking a break from checking that rooms throughout the Capitol were clear when he heard word over the radio that an officer — he didn’t know who — was receiving CPR. He looked down over a railing and saw, one floor below, some close friends from the midnight shift huddled over a body in uniform. He rushed to direct the E.M.T.s to the right elevator. When he joined his friends, he saw that the person they were helping was Brian Sicknick, Edwards’s shiftmate. He realized that a day that he thought could not possibly get even more horrific just had. In the Rotunda, Dunn collapsed against a wall beside a fellow officer, openly weeping. In a raw moment that would reverberate beyond that day, he called out in anguish: “Is this America?” Until Jan. 6, Anton, who patrolled outside the Capitol on the midnight shift, considered his most immediate adversaries to be winter’s frigid nights, summer’s suffocating heat and, year round, the possible complacency born of the work. The job, which he held with great pride, required staying alert for the possibility of a threat at all times, even though there were never any real indications of one. Not every officer took the job so seriously; for example, it bothered Gowdy that some officers literally slept on the job. But Anton felt that because the midnight crew was small, his responsibility at this site, whose history never failed to move him, was large. “Good job,” his colleagues used to say when they relieved him in the morning. “The building’s still here.” A violent clash against a mob of angry rioters was not the battle that the Capitol Police force was prepared or equipped to win. Military veterans like Anton make up only about 15 percent of the force; many officers, before Jan. 6, had never so much as made an arrest, much less engaged in hand-to-hand combat. In law-enforcement circles, the job was considered stable and cushy — average pay nears six figures, with federal benefits on top of that — if less than exciting. Although its budget is larger than that of the entire force serving Detroit, the Capitol Police Department is expected to provide security for lawmakers and staff in a complex of buildings on Capitol Hill covering less than half a square mile. The officers typically stood guard at checkpoints and metal detectors, provided new members and tourists directions around the labyrinthine building and monitored what were almost always small and peaceful protests on the various political issues that bring crowds to Washington. It wasn’t until around Christmas that Anton started to think that the Capitol might be facing a serious threat. Alarming warnings started coming through on every officer’s official email in the form of what were called BOLOs — alerts about people to “be on the lookout” for. Officers tended to ignore those messages, and Gonell says they did not strike him as out of the ordinary. But Anton, who had been on the force for almost three years, had never seen BOLOs anything like the ones in his inbox. The alerts included photos of people who were saying things in social media posts along the lines of: “My buddies and me are coming up there with our guns”; “People are going to get hurt.” Anton and several of his fellow officers, especially those who, like him, were military veterans, were worried about the Jan. 6 gathering and repeatedly approached their immediate supervisor, Gonell, to demand that he raise their concerns with his bosses. What was the plan in the event of even one active shooter? Not all members of the riot squad were trained to use long guns, but Anton thought they could strategize about how to make the most of those who were. (Other officers were also alerting their higher-ups to disturbing memes and posts they were seeing on social media.) Gonell confirms that he raised their suggestions with more senior members of the force, including his own lieutenant and the captain, but was repeatedly told to put his concerns in writing, which he did, to no avail. On Jan. 5, after roll call, Lt. Rani Brooks told the officers she brought up the issue with her captain, at their request, but got nowhere. “I’m not going to say she laughed, but. …” Brooks told them, according to four officers who were there at the time. (Brooks said through a police spokesman that she did not recall using that language.) The intelligence failures that left police officers, members of Congress and Vice President Mike Pence at risk are now well documented. Three days before the attack, an internal police intelligence report described what would occur with almost prophetic accuracy: “Unlike previous postelection protests, the targets of the pro-Trump supporters are not necessarily the counterprotesters as they were previously, but rather Congress itself is the target on the 6th. Stop the Steal’s propensity to attract white supremacists, militia members and others who actively promote violence may lead to a significantly dangerous situation for law enforcement and the general public alike.” Yet the agency failed to distribute such intelligence warnings to rank-and-file officers; to fully staff the force for what was increasingly predicted to be a large and unruly event; to allow officers to use their most powerful crowd-control weapons, like stun grenades, to confront the mob, or even to train enough officers on those weapons; to equip enough of the force with riot gear; or even to produce a plan for the situation. Given the obvious and disastrous failures, Chief Steven Sund, who was in charge of day-to-day force operations, resigned shortly after the riot, as did the sergeants-at-arms of the Senate and the House, figures elected by the leaders of each chamber to serve on a board that oversees the Capitol Police force and is ultimately responsible for the building’s security. Unlike most police departments, which report to an executive-branch leader like a mayor, the Capitol Police Department is the rare force controlled by a legislative body. The structure has helped create a notoriously secretive agency — one that is not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests and until recently has rarely held news conferences — and a sense among officers that with two often competing chambers of Congress in charge, no one is in charge. Capitol security officials have offered conflicting explanations for why the threats weren’t taken more seriously, but it has become clear that they and federal law-enforcement agencies were in a state of denial, unable to perceive what had seemed unimaginable: that a threat to Congress could be emanating from the president himself. Despite the department’s own dire prediction of an extremist attack on the Capitol, the leaders of the force were lulled into a false sense of security because they had handled two postelection rallies of Trump supporters with little incident, and because federal intelligence agencies weren’t ringing alarm bells. The Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. never issued an elevated or imminent alert, and the Capitol Police’s final intelligence report before Jan. 6 stated that the probability of civil disobedience was “remote” to “improbable.” Yogananda D. Pittman, the agency’s chief of protective and intelligence operations at the time, apologized to Congress for the failures, but Sund, the former chief, has blamed the F.B.I. and other agencies for missing the threats, arguing that the Capitol Police Department is mostly a “consumer” of information provided by the intelligence community and that the “entire intelligence community seems to have missed it.” There has been more blame to go around: Sund has faulted Congress’s two sergeants-at-arms for not more quickly heeding his calls to send in the National Guard, as well as lower-ranking intelligence officers who did not alert supervisors to warnings of threats. “The department expected and planned for violence from some protesters with ties to domestic terrorist organizations,” Chief J. Thomas Manger said in a statement, “but nobody in the law-enforcement or intelligence communities imagined, on top of that threat, Americans who were not affiliated with those groups would cause the mayhem to metastasize to a volume uncontrollable for any single law-enforcement agency.” It is widely known that about 150 officers from the Capitol and Metropolitan Police Departments and local agencies were injured during the violence, more than 80 from the Capitol Police alone. Less understood is how long-lasting the damage, physical and psychological, to the Capitol Police force has been, damage that informs many officers’ outrage about what they perceive as a lack of accountability for those responsible. Interviews over many months with more than two dozen officers and their families (some of whom requested not to use their full names to speak frankly without permission from the department or to protect future employment prospects in the federal government), as well as a review of internal documents, congressional testimony and medical records, reveal a department that is still hobbled and in many ways dysfunctional. Among those still on the force and those who have left, many significant injuries and psychological disorders remain, including serious traumatic brain injuries and neurological impairment, orthopedic injuries requiring surgery and rehabilitation, post-traumatic stress disorder and heightened anxiety. Deep frustrations remain with the leadership of the force. Most of the commanders widely viewed as failing the rank and file remain in positions of authority, including Pittman, who served as acting chief before Manger was hired in July. “Officers are still in disbelief that Assistant Chief Pittman is still in her role, where she failed miserably on Jan. 6,” says Gus Papathanasiou, chairman of the Capitol Police union. “I’ve heard from officers and supervisors who’ve retired; they didn’t want to work under her.” Tim Barber, a Capitol Police spokesman, said in a statement that “Chief Manger has expressed confidence in the department’s leadership team that remained” after the high-level departures in the wake of Jan. 6. In the year since the siege on the Capitol, about 135 officers on a force of about 1,800 have quit or retired, an increase of 69 percent over the year before. (One officer quit after enduring a string of tragedies: He suffered a stroke shortly after the assault on the Capitol and then contracted the coronavirus twice because of what he viewed as the department’s lax enforcement of mask-wearing protocols.) More may soon join them: Papathanasiou, the union chairman, warns that more than 500 additional officers will be eligible for retirement in the next five years. Officers we interviewed about their decision to leave said the failures of Jan. 6 were the most egregious of a series of management crises and errors. If Jan. 6 was a national tragedy, it was also one that the officers who served at the Capitol that day experienced cruelly and intimately in their own bodies, compounding the psychic fallout that has been especially profound in people who believed that their daily work reflected the country’s highest ideals: to protect members of Congress, regardless of party, in order to protect democracy itself. It was not unusual, the first week back at the Capitol after Jan. 6, for officers walking by a bathroom or one of the many small, hidden rooms in the building to overhear the sound of weeping. Anton thought his colleagues’ eyes looked vacant, and he was pretty sure they would have said the same of him. Officers were fearful and on high alert as bomb threats were called in every few days. Some officers, certain they’d never be given the equipment they needed, went out and bought their own helmets and Kevlar. On the morning of the 6th, members of the midnight shift had been sent home; now the Capitol Police called on officers to work long hours of overtime, even as they were surrounded by thousands of National Guard members, whose numbers dwarfed that of the force. Reports of possible security risks that would most likely have once been dismissed by leadership were now triggers for riot-control officers to throw on what they called their turtle gear — helmets and shields and full tactical gear — and go running to position for threats that never materialized. “We were chasing ghosts,” Anton says. The sergeant who watched Edwards go down on Jan. 6 (he has since retired) worried that he was sending officers to work crowd control who were in no condition to be there. “This is bullshit,” one officer started screaming as her unit geared up, just days after the 6th, to patrol a Black Lives Matter protest near the Capitol. Before the midnight shift on Jan. 7, officers received grim news: Brian Sicknick was in critical condition and not likely to survive (the Washington chief medical examiner would later report that he had succumbed to two strokes). At roll call for the riot squad, Capt. Ben Smith acknowledged widespread critiques of the force, reminding officers that they weren’t in it for public praise. No one needed a pat on the back, he told them, his affect flat, as three officers recalled; this was what they had signed up for. The room fell silent, stunned. For Anton, Smith’s comments confirmed that the Capitol Police leadership would handle the aftermath of the 6th as badly as they handled the run-up to it. Anton knew what he had signed up for, he thought as Smith spoke. But he had not signed up to serve a force so incompetent that it ignored all obvious signs of trouble ahead, and he had not signed up to fight an army of terrorizing Americans. Anton’s desire to serve his country was born on Sept. 11, 2001, when he and other students crowded around a television at his high school in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and watched the south tower of the World Trade Center crumble to the ground. His mother worked on the 10th floor of that building. He waited with dread for hours in his apartment, convinced that she was never coming home. Even after his mother walked through the door late that night, safe but shaken, his protective impulse remained. “I just wanted to help,” Anton said many months after the assault on the Capitol, after his disillusionment with the force had swelled and spilled over into so many aspects of his life that he barely recognized himself. “In the Navy, I was always the damage-control man, which is essentially like a firefighter-slash-emergency manager. So I was always in a job where I wanted to help protect people, to prevent bad things from happening. That’s who I am at the core of my life.” All he wanted to do, in those days leading up to the 6th, was help ensure that this federal agency would fiercely protect its leaders and citizens; by the time the captain was addressing him and his peers at roll call on the 7th, the damage was done. Morale took another blow on Jan. 9 with the death of Officer Howard Liebengood, who was on duty during the attack and took his life three days later. His wife, Serena Liebengood, wrote in an open letter to her Virginia congresswoman, Jennifer Wexton, that her husband had been called on to work “practically around the clock” after the 6th and was severely sleep-deprived. The entire force had been thrust into similarly punishing overtime shifts, exhausting officers whose nervous systems were already jarred. Mental-health resources were so insufficient that the sergeant who since retired received permission to ask for help from his hometown pastor, who arrived at the Capitol with two other pastors to offer immediate counseling. On the job, officers traded information about the ones who were missing. Gowdy, a baby-faced officer who clearly found great satisfaction in the authority his uniform lent him, was back home in Pennsylvania Dutch country, recovering from a concussion. Edwards had scabs under her eyes from the chemical burns, as well as a concussion; for the first few days after the attack, she could barely speak or walk. Her husband was also an officer who was in the fray that day, but he was uninjured and felt he was needed at the Capitol, so Edwards flew down to Atlanta, where her mother could help her recover. Gonell, Anton’s sergeant, tried going to work after the 6th, even though he was clearly in pain. An immigrant from the Dominican Republic, Gonell was proud to be a sergeant; he sometimes wondered whether he might have gone even further if his accent were less strong, his English a little better. Now he wanted to be there for his officers, but his supervisor, noticing that Gonell was limping, told him not to come back until he’d seen a doctor. Even after that appointment, he continued going to work until the pain was so overwhelming that he could barely drive. M.R.I.s revealed that he would need a bone fusion in his foot and surgery to repair his shoulder. Gonell reluctantly put in paperwork for an extended leave. Tricoche spent the first two days after the 6th taking care of a hand so black and blue, so swollen, that his thumb could not meet his forefinger. The gashes all over both shins from his fall on the steps would leave scars, but he was more worried about his state of mind. He was working 12- and 16-hour shifts with few days off. He was also in a perpetual state of disgust: The orders coming down, as officers worked cheek by jowl with thousands of National Guard members on the premises, seemed chaotic. Even after what they’d all just lived through, could no one fix what was so clearly broken in management? In the days after the attack, Dunn, usually an extrovert, felt himself grow depressed. Someone known on the force for speaking his mind (to some, more often than warranted), he instead started isolating himself from his colleagues, eating lunch alone in his car. On social media and sometimes in the press, critics were suggesting that the officers were riot sympathizers who looked the other way; Dunn desperately wanted to offer the contrary facts (which an internal investigation by the Capitol Police and federal prosecutors would eventually confirm): Officers were overwhelmed — and, in a few cases, had shown poor judgment in an effort to assuage the crowd — but they generally had acted heroically and were not complicit. (In the aftermath, six officers would face internal discipline for their actions on Jan. 6, and one would be charged criminally for obstructing justice afterward.) Just days after the 6th, Dunn gave an anonymous interview to BuzzFeed News, in which he recounted his anguished cry in the Rotunda: “Is this America?” During Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial, Representative Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat and the lead impeachment manager, quoted those very words in his concluding statements. Dunn, moved to see how his words were used, received clearance from the force to speak more widely to the press, giving interviews to ABC News, CNN, The New York Times. He shared some of the most personal aspects of the day for him — like being called the N-word for the first time in uniform. Not everyone on the force, which is mostly white (as opposed to the Metropolitan Police Department, which is 50 percent Black), was thrilled that Dunn was the single voice self-designated to speak for all of them. To some, when Dunn talked about the racism he endured on Jan. 6, he made it sound as if it was “all about race,” as one officer put it, especially given that the two Capitol Police officers who died soon after the attack were white. Dunn, aware of that criticism, felt that his critics were focusing on only one aspect of what he discussed on-air: He was also trying to defend the bravery of the force as a whole. Dunn knew that the Capitol Police Department was depleted, emotionally and numerically: Many were out recovering from their injuries, or they were out sick with Covid, or they were out because they had quit, which put more pressure on the officers still on the force. Still expected to provide security for long and unpredictable sessions of Congress, officers say they were typically receiving only one or two days off per month. Those who served on Jan. 6 were granted only two eight-hour shifts of administrative leave, but many officers felt they were unable to take that leave, much less ask for more. Officers feared that if they went on leave for their mental health, they would only burden their colleagues or jeopardize their job prospects. “I would not be surprised if down the road the department gets sued — big time — for their lack of action after Jan. 6,” one officer said, referring to the mental-health effects of such long hours after the attack. Tricoche had started to feel he was not entirely himself even before the 6th, exhausted and distressed after working at protests throughout 2020. He was called an Uncle Tom at a Black Lives Matter rally, then called the N-word at the first big MAGA rally, and felt, particularly at the MAGA event, a sense that the Capitol Police officers were little more than costumed props, instructed to simply walk alongside large mobs, with no viable plan for what they were supposed to do if protesters easily overwhelmed the few officers between them and the building. Although Tricoche was close to his unit — they worked from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. — he felt increasingly alienated from the force itself, where the divisiveness of the outside world inevitably filtered in. On election night, he and Anton watched the returns in a small room where other officers occasionally passed through. Officers kept tossing out predictions about how things would go down if Joe Biden lost — Man, Black Lives Matter was going to get crazy, they said; the protesters were going to get out of hand; it would be a nightmare at the Capitol. Tricoche waited until they were alone in the room and then turned to Anton. The real question, he said, is what happens if Trump loses and doesn’t leave. The two of them went back and forth, playing out the scenarios. Did they trust certain colleagues not to let Trump walk right into the Capitol after Biden was supposed to take office? Did they even trust those colleagues not to turn their guns on Anton or Tricoche if they tried to stand in Trump’s way? The answer, they both thought, might be no. Tricoche’s colleagues knew him as an officer who had a fierce sense of duty but was otherwise an unusual figure on the force. In quiet moments on midnights, he worked his way through F. Scott Fitzgerald, Charles Bukowski, poets like Baudelaire and T.S. Eliot. He received a full R.O.T.C. scholarship to Penn State but dropped out when he suffered an episode of deep depression. Now 29, he’d become one of Gonell’s most reliable underlings, someone Gonell described as “an excellent officer — always willing to step up and do the job, very responsible.” At work, Tricoche continued to be the leader Gonell knew — taking charge of the unit with Anton in Gonell’s absence — but at home, he was suffering from insomnia, still jacked on adrenaline and anxiety. He couldn’t rest, and he couldn’t plan, because they were often slammed with an extra shift at the last moment. As he crumbled under the stress of the previous weeks, a relationship important to him started falling apart, and now he counted that among the other failures that tormented him. He kept going over the events of the 6th — surely he could have done something more in the face of all that madness. He felt himself spiraling downward, writing in his journal, “I dream of a darkness darker than black.”   Nicole, the wife of the officer who tumbled down the stone stairs under the scaffolding for the inaugural stage, was watching Fox News when she first learned something was amiss at the Capitol. Soon after that, she got a call from the wife of a fellow officer, telling Nicole that her husband was receiving medical care. When he finally came home early on the morning of the 7th, he was dazed, quiet and drained. A doctor he saw that night in the emergency room told him he probably had a concussion and could not return to work until he had been cleared by his primary-care physician. Nicole (who asked to be identified by her middle name to protect her family’s privacy) wasn’t too worried. They’d see how he felt tomorrow; she went to bed disturbed but not particularly alarmed about her husband’s health. The next day, her husband was supposed to rest and stay quiet, but his phone was blowing up with texts from his best friends, a group of men who were known as the North Barricade Crew after the spot where they were usually stationed. Irreverent, tight-knit, they brought a certain insult-comic humor to roll call (after one member mooned a sergeant near his post, another sergeant started calling them the Motley Crew). If they were rowdy, it was a privilege that came with more than a decade of experience for each, and friendships just as long. The group texts that day, however, were somber, as they tried to piece together who had been where, how it all went down. Even those who were not there that day were suffering. Billy Evans, a good friend of her husband’s, was off duty watching his kids when the events unfolded. Now he was stricken that he had not been there to support his colleagues. Her husband couldn’t stay away from the news, online and on television, even though it only fueled his anger. He was angry at the rioters, angry that some of them had dared to say they were on the officers’ side. His memories of the day were impressionistic, dreamlike, spotty, scenes from a zombie movie he never wanted to star in; it was days before he learned from a friend that he had been knocked unconscious and was out for three minutes. When he walked on his right foot, he felt as if he were stepping on gravel, and he felt dazed, with bouts of grief and rage searing through the fog. Now on leave himself, he worried that another attack would happen while he was sitting at home. “I just know something bad’s going to happen, and I won’t be there to help,” he often said to Nicole. He could imagine little worse. By the 9th, Nicole and her husband were starting to have more serious concerns about his symptoms. Sometimes when he stood up, he tilted backward, on the verge of falling. All three of their children had names that started with the same letter, and several times he tried to address one of them only to stutter on that first consonant, unable to get out a simple sentence. His friends corresponded mostly by text, and one was shocked when they finally did speak by phone. “He can’t even get his words out,” he texted the others. Nicole, an organized person who had worked in operations for a small business for decades, always believed there were few crises that could not be managed by the effective deployment of checklists. So she started making them: Find neurologist, find paperwork for neurologist appointment, schedule appointment with orthopedist, file paperwork for disability leave. She took out a bright yellow folder and neatly labeled it: “January 6.” The bronze door near the Rotunda still had a huge spider crack in its pane, a sight that made Anton feel a splinter in his own heart. Windows where the sun had shone through on countless elected officials were now boarded up, so that the whole building looked as if it were about to go into foreclosure. On March 4, Anton and Tricoche showed up to their midnight shift and discovered that instead of serving on riot control, they would be assigned elsewhere. Senator Tammy Duckworth had requested an escort. Duckworth, an Army veteran and the only senator who uses a wheelchair, had a harrowing experience on the 6th, coming within minutes of crossing paths with the mob. There was no specific cause for concern that night, but in case of something unexpected, she wanted officers waiting at the Senate chamber to help her get out of the building. Anton and Tricoche considered protecting a member of Congress to be the highest honor of their roles as Capitol Police officers. They had the official training to use long guns, so they retrieved M4s and magazines from the armory and escorted the senator to the chamber, as she thanked them profusely. But while she was in the bathroom, someone else — they later learned it was the acting Senate sergeant-at-arms — approached them, agitated, and demanded to know what they were doing there. At that moment, Duckworth exited the bathroom and said she had specifically asked for them to be there for her. (Ben Garmisa, a spokesman for Duckworth, declined to comment.) But as soon as she disappeared into the Senate gallery, Anton’s phone rang: Their acting sergeant told them to return those weapons immediately. They later learned that either a senator or a staff member had told the acting sergeant-at-arms that the body armor and weapons made them uncomfortable. Anton had sworn to protect the lives of those senators with his own body, if it came down to it, and now he felt he was being chastised for providing safety to one of them. Both he and Tricoche appreciated that Congress had always operated free of military guard. But they felt the overwhelming sense that those in charge of the Capitol did not grasp the new reality in which they were operating — or the country’s new reality, for that matter. Tricoche’s frustration was rising, his mental health declining. Exhausted from work, emotionally strung out, he was feeling a kind of slippage, especially when he was alone. On March 8, he felt so utterly bereft that it overwhelmed him, and he called in to say he would be missing work. Over the next days, he remained home but couldn’t summon the energy even to call in or to respond to the worried texts he was receiving. “You here tonight?” Anton wrote. “Yo yo yo man you hanging in?” Ten days ticked on, with Tricoche ignoring text after text, from two sergeants who he knew cared about him, and from Anton. “Hey bro I don’t know what’s going on but everyone is looking for you and they are going to request a welfare check on you and send people to your place,” Anton wrote on March 13. He’d driven to Tricoche’s apartment with a sergeant, pounded on the door, heard nothing. “I hope you are at home doing well,” he texted later that night. “Miss ya man.” Tricoche knew enough to seek help from a doctor, who told him his hours were doing him harm and prescribed anti-anxiety medication and sleep aids. And yet, at some point that week, consumed by a feeling of failure, convinced that he was only adding to others’ suffering, he swallowed a large amount of over-the-counter medication. He woke up, unsure how many hours later, in a pool of vomit with aching liver pain. After one of his sergeants reached out to Tricoche’s mother, he finally called in to say he was alive. He returned to work the next day and told a sergeant he trusted what happened. Then he turned in his badge and his gun. “I was so destitute spiritually that it didn’t matter,” he says. “I was feeling nothing.” Tricoche took time off from work, alternating between his lonely apartment and his crowded childhood home in Levittown, Pa., where he crashed on the couch, immobile, silent, near catatonic, as family life swirled all around him: several half or stepsiblings, most of them young adults. His mother, stepfather and the rest of the family were white, but Tricoche’s father is Black, and he describes himself as mixed race. Almost every person of voting age he was living with, he knew, voted for Trump, and Trump signs stood all over the neighborhood. For all he knew, the neighbors felt the same way as the people who came to attack the Capitol — who came to attack him. For all he knew, they were even there that day. When people told Caroline Edwards that it was a radio call about her fall on the 6th that marked, for them, the start of that day with so many horrors to follow, it embarrassed her. She hated being the first officer down; she hated that she was taken to get medical help, while Brian Sicknick stayed on and kept fighting, only to die the next day. All those details pained her when she went over everything she lived through on the 6th, which she did, over and over and over. Edwards was anything but a pushover. She was one of only two women on the union board, a slot she landed at age 29. But now she shook when she tried to talk about what happened. She had ongoing symptoms from what was diagnosed as a traumatic brain injury: Her balance was off, and she experienced so much vertigo that she could barely walk. For months, her speech would be slow and labored; at the end of March, she was still fainting with troubling frequency. She had met her husband, a fellow officer, on the job. Sometimes people told her they thought it must be easier for her, at least, to have a spouse who was going through the same thing; so many officers found that their spouses simply could not understand what they were going through. “No,” she told them. “There is no easy. It just all sucks.” They were each short-tempered; they had both experienced the 6th but now were in different emotional places at a time when they had never needed each other more. Edwards was one of many on the force who suffered concussions; of the seven or eight officers in Gonell’s squad who served on the 6th, he counted three, and a possible fourth. By March, Devan Gowdy was past the acute phase of his concussion: sleeping around the clock, waking from nightmares that left him pumping with feelings of murderous rage. Still, he knew he was not himself, or was not the self he was before the 6th. An unusually sensitive person — his best friend, growing up, was the elderly antiques dealer who lived next door — he had turned into someone who could be roiled with fury. He often woke up weeping, turning to his fiancée in bed to tell her how scared he was, even if he couldn’t identify any threat. Nicole’s husband was also showing uncharacteristic volatility, his anger sometimes explosive. She did not hold her husband responsible for it. She thought that if she could just be even more organized, control any possibility of chaos — as if the chaos of life with three kids could be controlled — she could spare her husband exposure to stress, spare them all his reactions to that stress. So she stayed up late, folding every piece of laundry, writing more lists for the coming week, making sure that her son’s baseball uniform was where it needed to be so there would be no last-minute panic, no hassle, no outbursts. In early spring, some of the officers who had been on leave were starting to return. But her husband was still receiving treatment for his brain injury, mental exercises to help restore his balance that left him nauseated and drained. He had memory lapses; he had frustration with those memory lapses. Complicated paperwork like the kind she was always churning through overwhelmed him quickly, so she stopped trying to explain the mind-numbing, arcane logistics of his medical care. He was still on the group texts that his friends from the North Barricade Crew sent around regularly, but because he had been gone so long, he didn’t always know what they were talking about. On April 2, Nicole’s family and in-laws were at Luray Caverns, outside Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, trying to take her husband’s mind off his troubles, when she saw him check his phone. Then he was down, a tall lumbering man with a long beard, fallen to his knees. Texts were coming in: There had been an attack at the Capitol. Two men at the north barricade were hurt, one much worse than the other. One of them was Billy Evans. It was a knife — no, it was a man with a gun. No, a car drove into them, colliding most directly with Evans. That was confirmed. Nicole’s own phone started pinging with messages from other officers and lieutenants: She needed to prepare herself — her husband — for the worst. Her husband told his parents to take the children to the gift shop, and then he stayed where he was, weeping uncontrollably over a guardrail. He regained his composure enough to get into the car, but that was impossible to maintain when, a few minutes into the drive, he got the text: Billy was gone. As a matter of habit, Anton usually parked his Jeep up on Delaware Avenue, right near the north barricade where Billy Evans lost his life. He lived only 15 minutes away, and he often felt, when he arrived, that he had never left work. He was still, in April, working a never-ending series of 12-hour shifts with rare days off. Especially after Evans died, a feeling of dread came over him with such force that he sometimes struggled to leave his car. He tried to summon reserves of discipline. “May we pass every test,” he’d say when he pulled in, to prepare himself for the grueling day ahead. It was something he and his mom, who raised him Baptist, used to say whenever he had a big exam or another challenge, and they always said it together, three times, half chanting, half praying. Pulling the key out of the ignition, he could sometimes say it only once before he felt something give way, the emotional equivalent of his knees buckling. He’d walk toward the Capitol, pacing himself as he neared the street he needed to cross. By the time the light turned red, he had wiped his face and prepared himself to enter the building. Anton wondered how long he could continue on the job. He had always enjoyed perfect health, but now he was having heart palpitations several times a day that forced him to stop whatever he was doing; more than once he wondered if he could be having a heart attack. His sleep was erratic, his blood pressure and cholesterol sky high. Like many other officers, he found it a boost to morale when Caroline Edwards returned to work in May. Because of her injuries, she was assigned to a desk job, but she had also taken on an additional role that was natural for her: She was becoming a peer counselor, someone in whom officers could confide. She had already been functioning informally in that capacity, reaching out to Nicole’s husband to offer whatever she could share about traumatic brain injuries and sending Shannon Terranova, the grieving former wife of Billy Evans, thoughtful gifts for their children. Work was like one vast crime scene they all had to keep revisiting, day after day. Informal memorials for Billy Evans and Brian Sicknick had been set up on two separate tables, with fresh flowers and photos and badges, that everyone passed in the hallway as they walked down to reach the Capitol Police locker room. Sicknick had served on the mountain-bike unit that patrolled around the building, and his bicycle was placed in front of the display. Jason DeRoche, a Capitol Police officer for 18 years who drove to Massachusetts for Evans’s funeral, was already angry about the events of the 6th, and he became even more so after the death of his friend. He decided to join a lawsuit brought by seven officers against Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 attack. Gowdy had returned to work from medical leave just a few days before the attack that took Evans’s life. Walking by the display every day, seeing the smiling, proud faces of Sicknick and Evans, was excruciating for him, a reminder of what partisan warring had wrought. He used to love being a Capitol Police officer, had considered that position to be the greatest accomplishment of his life. Working in the Capitol Visitor Center had been his favorite assignment; he loved meeting the tourists, making them feel welcome, and had even learned to say, “Please take off your belt” in Mandarin, which never failed to make Chinese tourists laugh. But now that he was back, he viewed everybody through new, suspicious eyes, especially anyone wearing a MAGA hat. He felt uncomfortable being back in Washington. Everywhere he went, he looked at the people milling around and wondered: Were you there on the 6th? Was it you? On May 28, Gonell was lying in bed, his foot elevated after an operation, when he saw Harry Dunn on CNN. He was paying a visit to the Senate, along with Sandra Garza, the longtime partner of Brian Sicknick; Sicknick’s mother; and Michael Fanone, a Metropolitan Police officer who fought alongside Gonell at that crammed doorway at the lower west entrance of the Capitol. Seeing Fanone was emotional for Gonell: Fanone relieved Gonell on the 6th, taking over the precise spot where Gonell was standing before he headed back into the building for water and reinforcements. Just moments later, Fanone was dragged into the crowd and tased, suffering a heart attack as a result, as well as a traumatic brain injury. Had Fanone not taken his place, Gonell might have been the officer who was tased, who could have suffered a heart attack, or worse, for all he knew. Dunn and the others were there that day to try to visit Republican senators, hoping to persuade them to support an independent commission that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other key House members had negotiated to investigate the Jan. 6 siege. Ten senators would be enough to overcome a filibuster from a party eager to consign the events of that day to the past. In every office, the Republican senators told the officers how tragic they found the Jan. 6 attack, shook their hands and made eye contact, thanked them for their service. As Fanone recounted his experience of the attacks, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina struck Garza as so bored and distracted that she made clear her irritation. Garza, along with Sicknick, was a Trump supporter and had doubts about the validity of the election before the 6th, but her opinion of Trump had radically changed after Sicknick’s death. “I said, ‘I feel like you’re being very disrespectful, and you’re looking out the window and tapping your fingers on the desk,’” she recalled. Another senator at the meeting tried to tell her she was misreading Graham’s body language, which only infuriated her more. Dunn found the senators’ failure to commit to what seemed like the minimum they could do equally enraging. There were no cameras there, so couldn’t they just tell him straight: Were they going to vote for this thing or not? Graham, who had made a big show of how angry he was about the violence on the 6th, indicated that he would be voting against the independent commission. Senator Tim Scott, also in the room, told the officers that while he and Graham agreed there should be accountability for the attack on the Capitol, they didn’t like the vehicle that was being used to drive to the destination, as Dunn recalled. It was typical political talk, the officers thought, and sure enough, the independent commission failed to overcome a Republican filibuster in the Senate, leaving Pelosi with little other option than to appoint a select committee dominated by Democrats to carry out the inquiry. Gonell, watching the news, seeing the dejection in the body language of the five people leaving the Senate, was suddenly overwhelmed with emotion. His wife, hearing the sound of him sobbing, came running in, fearing that he’d fallen and reinjured his foot. That was it, he told her. For months he’d been saying he wanted to speak out about the 6th. His wife was a private person and thought that going public could open them to harassment, maybe even worse. But this hypocrisy — the refusal to support the officers who had ensured those same senators’ safety — was more than he could silently stand by and take. He had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and was clearly depressed; if he could speak his mind, he thought, his recovery might begin. After the vote that day, he reached out to Dunn, who was at a store when he got Gonell’s call and walked the aisles in circles as he listened to the sergeant in tears on the other end of the line. Gonell apologized to Dunn for not joining him sooner. He knew how hard it must have been to be the lone voice of the Capitol Police. Dunn put him in touch with his own lawyer and with CNN. “As courtesy and respect,” he wrote to his supervisor, “making you aware that earlier today (Friday afternoon) I conducted an interview with cnn regarding my experience and ordeal I went through. These last few days has been very hard for me emotionally after seeing Officer Sicknick family literally begging these people to support the commission. I felt I couldn’t stay quiet anymore.” A month later, Gonell, Dunn, Fanone and Officer Daniel Hodges of the Metropolitan Police were asked to testify before Congress about the attacks. The hearing on July 27, the first of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack, was a somber and emotional affair. The officers entered the room, one by one, stately in their decorated dark blue uniforms. The lawmakers played graphic video showing the violence the officers endured, eerie and disturbing footage that filled the small room. Hodges described how the rioters called him a traitor and how one tried to gouge out his eye. Fanone told of how he was beaten and tased until he was unconscious and how, to this day, he believes that he is only alive because he pleaded with his assailants, telling them he had children. Dunn, tearing up, told of the racist abuse he endured. Gonell, still recovering from his injuries, described the fight as a “medieval battle.” If Dunn was persuasive because he was so naturally telegenic, Gonell had a different power onscreen, a humility and indignation that was equally affecting. Going in, the officers felt hopeful that their open accounting of the facts of Jan. 6 would refute the right-wing conspiracy theorists; instead they would be attacked as “crisis actors” faking their tears. Representative Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican and member of the committee, tearfully credited the men with successfully fighting off the mob, clearing the Capitol and ensuring that no member of Congress was injured. He called the officers heroes. “You guys may individually feel a little broken,” he said. “You guys all talk about the effects you have to deal with, and you talk about the impact of that day. But you guys won. You guys held.” He added, “We are only here now because you guys were here then.” But while the members of the committee were visibly affected, afterward, Gonell felt, some Republicans realized that the more they leaned into their denials, the more they saw their poll numbers rise. The divisions that had devastated the country, that had literally left him and so many others wounded, were just useful tools, with politicians grabbing whatever was on hand that they could use as weapons in their own daily fights. On Nov. 2, Caroline Edwards, still on desk duty because of her injuries, was working the phones in an office at the Capitol when she started to feel faint — so faint that her husband heard a call go out over the radio: A 31-year-old female working in the office needed medical assistance. Edwards had been pushing herself of late, working on a master’s degree in intelligence analysis at Johns Hopkins University while still serving at the Capitol, though with reduced hours because of her injuries. Her doctors had not figured out how to prevent her fainting spells. But that day marked the first time she’d fallen so ill on the job. A colleague, noticing that she was fading in and out of consciousness, called an ambulance; to Edwards’s mortification, she was taken out of the building on a gurney. A memo went around to ranking officers, apprising them of what happened, an unnerving reminder that the suffering that befell them on Jan. 6 still had many of them in its grip. It was as if the person who was there to help the officers move forward was embodying, in plain sight, just how difficult that was proving to be. Gonell returned to work the day after Edwards’s brief visit to the hospital. He was already feeling apprehensive; he sensed there were officers who resented how outspoken he had been about his anger toward Trump and other Republicans who played down the seriousness of the attacks. Some colleagues greeted him warmly; others were cold, their reserve speaking volumes. One night, he rounded a bend and saw two flagpoles without flags leaning in a corner — weapons, he was sure, left over from the 6th. Standing outside the Capitol one night this December on duty with Hoyte, who had three bulging discs and a shoulder tear, he wondered aloud how many officers were questioning whether they were willing to risk their lives should Trump ever summon his followers to the Capitol again. “I don’t want to see a plaque right here,” he said, hitting the smooth surface of the building. “‘In memory of Sgt. Aquilino Gonell. In honor of Officer Lennox Hoyte.”’ Many of the officers who served under Gonell were no longer working the midnight shift, or at the Capitol at all. Tricoche left the force in May, shortly after his attempt on his own life. He tried to go back after taking some time to recover from his depression, but he lasted a shift and a half before informing his sergeant — Gonell was not yet back — that he was done. Gowdy resigned in June, transferring to an administrative job in the federal government and moving to Maryland to live with his fiancée. And yet even in December, far from Washington and police duty, the effects of his concussion still plagued him. Once known for his mild disposition, he was now unsettled by the smallest disruptions. A loud crowd at a restaurant didn’t just irritate him; it made him angry, with an ugly, jagged feeling that would have been alien a year before. “The insurrection made me realize how people aren’t always doing things for the best of the people,” he texted to Tricoche. “I am not sure what the future looks like for this country.” Anton, who still talks with Tricoche every night, quit in July. He remained in Washington but made a point of avoiding the sight of the Capitol whenever he drove by. Nicole’s husband was one of a handful of officers still on medical leave in November. He and Nicole were deeply private people devoted to family, church and their children’s team sports. They were Republicans, and Nicole was frustrated by the narratives of the Capitol Police that were dominating the news: The force seemed to be represented by officers who struck her as Trump-hating radicals on the left, or else were portrayed as lax extremists who supported the rioters. She and her husband voted for Trump and still would again if he were the Republican nominee, but that did not mean they were not outraged — disgusted — by him and by the rioters. Even so, she believed that to focus on Trump would be to distract from the people who had most betrayed her husband: the Capitol Police leadership, who dared to send her husband into battle, as she put it, without so much as a helmet. Her husband was still in physical therapy, recovering from two separate operations on his foot. The stuttering, the migraines, the brain fog were still too overwhelming for him to think about returning to work, no matter how much he missed it, and the therapy for that also demanded his time. He tried to cope with his grieving over Evans’s death by being there as much as he could for Evans’s children and their mother, Shannon Terranova, now parenting their two grieving children entirely on her own. He joined Terranova and her son for a haircut and a Slurpee, stepping in for a father-son ritual. That, too, was bittersweet. At times, Nicole felt that their house was tense with her husband’s sorrow — for his friend, for his former self. On the 6th, he had left his weapon at the Capitol, and there were days when she took great comfort in knowing that gun was far from their home.   In December, the Capitol Police Department was still reeling from the aftermath of the attacks. “Almost a year out, it’s common for officers to still be struggling,” said one ranking officer (who asked for anonymity to speak freely without fear of reprisal). “The most challenging part of my job is trying to help those officers.” The department’s inspector general, Michael Bolton, was completing a yearlong investigation into the myriad failures of the Capitol Police. At a hearing on Dec. 7 held by the Senate Rules Committee, which has been conducting a review of the agency, Bolton told the lawmakers that “much work still needs to be addressed” in the areas of training, intelligence, overall culture and planning operations, adding that this work would require “hard changes in the department.”  “They lost so many of their fellow officers, including those who sadly died by suicide,” Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat who is the chairwoman of the committee, said that day. “This police department, like many across the country, is facing staff shortages, and we must fill those jobs.” Senator Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, noted the increased workload that each remaining officer endured while the department failed to retain others. “We have more overtime than the officers or their families want them to have,” he said. “You’re going to have people working harder and longer hours than you want them to work.” Capitol Police management says commanders have taken a number of steps to address the glaring flaws that were laid bare on Jan. 6. The agency has allocated some $4 million on peer-support counseling (more than half of which must be reimbursed to the U.S. Marshals for its support after the 6th), more than $3 million for retention bonuses to try to keep officers from quitting and more than $2 million for tuition credits that they hope will serve as another incentive to stay. The force has hired six new “wellness specialists.” It has also begun sharing intelligence with the rank and file — after its three different intelligence units failed to share throughout the department warnings of potential violence in the buildup to the attack — and spent $5 million on new equipment, including more gas masks, tactical vests, protective equipment and shields. But the agency has failed to execute a vast majority of improvements recommended by the inspector general, with only 30 of 104 recommendations implemented, Bolton reported at the hearing. Troubling risks remain, not only to the force but also to lawmakers and to the Capitol itself. Bolton told the senators that morale was still an issue. “I think the officers are in that wait-and-see mode,” he said. “They want to see what else are we going to do. And they do recognize it does take time. But also they are watching leadership, and watching the community at large. How are we going to move forward?” Anton, now unemployed and living off his savings, did not need to watch a hearing to know the state of the Capitol Police; texts and Instagram messages kept him apprised. “The closest thing to an all out attack took place and nothing has changed,” a friend wrote him in November. “No hope.” Tricoche had decided to return to college to study creative writing. But Anton was still trying to figure out what his next move might be, or even who he might be. The American flag, a symbol that once moved him deeply, now made him feel empty whenever it caught his eye, and it was everywhere in Washington. He had seen for himself how it could be imbued with any evil meaning its carrier intended. He didn’t even trust his own interpretation of what the flag had meant to him. Those people frothing at the mouth, risking their own lives to take over Congress, which is what he heard them screaming in the Rotunda they wanted to do? They thought they knew what the flag stood for, too. When he was a kid, Anton had always loved comic books, the dark complexity of Spider-Man, the up-from-Brooklyn fight of Captain America, the guilt they feel that even they can’t save everyone. He thought a lot about one comic in which Spider-Man just up and quits because he can’t take it anymore. He loved it when those books reached into the psyches of those heroes, the way they asked themselves, What am I actually doing? That’s what he was asking himself now. He would never call himself a hero, but he identified with what other people considered heroics — going above and beyond to try to right the world’s wrongs. He had tried to do just that, all his life, and now here he was, at age 34, having come out worse, way worse. Still, that was all he knew how to do: fight the bad guys, put out fires, wield a gun. He was applying for alphabet-soup federal jobs (C.I.A., A.T.F., E.P.A.). But sometimes he thought he’d rather use his skills providing security — like a mercenary — for anyone who could pay well, just so long as they had no ethos, no code of conduct, no statement of higher principles — no illusions about a higher cause or the virtues of that employer. He would spend Christmas with his parents, who now lived in North Carolina, and to whom he was still very close. He thought about his mother when he was fighting in the Rotunda — had hoped that if he died that day, he’d at least get to be some kind of Casper the Ghost, floating above and looking down to see her. Her experience was one reason he wanted to serve his country in the first place. She had come home on Sept. 11, a day that brought the country together, but even so, every year, she struggled on the anniversary. How would he feel on the anniversary of Jan. 6, a day of tragedy that should have united the country but had only driven people further apart?

I have long been aware that the pandemic was upending children’s lives. But until I spent time pulling together data and reading reports, I did not understand just how alarming the situation had become. Today’s newsletter offers an overview of that crisis. Children fell far behind in school during the first year of the pandemic and have not caught up. Among third through eighth graders, math and reading levels were all lower than normal this fall, according to NWEA, a research group. The shortfalls were largest for Black and Hispanic students, as well as students in schools with high poverty rates. “We haven’t seen this kind of academic achievement crisis in living memory,” Michael Petrilli of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute told Politico. Many children and teenagers are experiencing mental health problems, aggravated by the isolation and disruption of the pandemic. Three medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, recently declared a national state of emergency in children’s mental health. They cited “dramatic increases in emergency department visits for all mental health emergencies.” Suicide attempts have risen, slightly among adolescent boys and sharply among adolescent girls. The number of E.R. visits for suspected suicide attempts by 12- to 17-year-old girls rose by 51 percent from early 2019 to early 2021, according to the C.D.C. Gun violence against children has increased, as part of a broader nationwide rise in crime. In Chicago, for example, 101 residents under age 20 were murdered last year, up from 76 in 2019. School shootings have also risen: The Washington Post counted 42 last year in the U.S., the most on record and up from 27 in 2019. Many schools have still not returned to normal, worsening learning loss and social isolation. Once-normal aspects of school life — lunchtime, extracurricular activities, assemblies, school trips, parent-teacher conferences, reliable bus schedules — have been transformed if not eliminated. When The Morning asked parents and teachers about the situation in their local schools, we heard an outpouring of anguish: Behavior problems have increased. “Schools across the country say they’re seeing an uptick in disruptive behaviors,” Kalyn Belsha of Chalkbeat reported. “Some are obvious and visible, like students trashing bathrooms, fighting over social media posts or running out of classrooms. Others are quieter calls for help, like students putting their head down and refusing to talk.” Kelli Tuttle, a teacher in Madison, Wis., told us, “There is a lot of swearing, vandalism and some fights.” A teacher in Northern California said she had witnessed the “meanest, most inappropriate comments to teachers” in her 15 years of working in schools. The Omicron variant is now scrambling children’s lives again. Most schools have stayed open this week, but many have canceled sports, plays and other activities. Some districts have closed schools, for a day or more, despite evidence that most children struggle to learn remotely, as my colleague Dana Goldstein reports. Closings are taking place in Atlanta, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Newark and several New York City suburbs, among other places. “It’s chaos,” Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, told Dana. “The No. 1 thing that parents and families are crying out for is stability.” For the past two years, large parts of American society have decided harming children was an unavoidable side effect of Covid-19. And that was probably true in the spring of 2020, when nearly all of society shut down to slow the spread of a deadly and mysterious virus. But the approach has been less defensible for the past year and a half, as we have learned more about both Covid and the extent of children’s suffering from pandemic restrictions. Data now suggest that many changes to school routines are of questionable value in controlling the virus’s spread. Some researchers are skeptical that school closures reduce Covid cases in most instances. Other interventions, like forcing students to sit apart from their friends at lunch, may also have little benefit. One reason: Severe versions of Covid, including long Covid, are extremely rare in children. For them, the virus resembles a typical flu. Children face more risk from car rides than Covid. The widespread availability of vaccines since last spring also raises an ethical question: Should children suffer to protect unvaccinated adults — who are voluntarily accepting Covid risk for themselves and increasing everybody else’s risk, too? Right now, the United States is effectively saying yes. To be clear, there are some hard decisions and unavoidable trade-offs. Covid can lead to hospitalization or worse for a small percentage of vaccinated adults, especially those who are elderly or immunocompromised, and allowing children to resume normal life could create additional risk. The Omicron surge may well heighten that risk, leaving schools with no attractive options. For the past two years, however, many communities in the U.S. have not really grappled with the trade-off. They have tried to minimize the spread of Covid — a worthy goal absent other factors — rather than minimizing the damage that Covid does to society. They have accepted more harm to children in exchange for less harm to adults, often without acknowledging the dilemma or assessing which decisions lead to less overall harm. Given the choices that the country has made, it should not be surprising that children are suffering so much.

So when the naturalist John Young produced evidence of the near-mythic bird in a remote corner of Australia’s outback in 2013, it was one of the greatest stories of species rediscovery in recent times. It was “the bird-watching equivalent of finding Elvis flipping burgers in an outback roadhouse,” Sean Dooley of BirdLife Australia, told the country’s national broadcaster at the time. It got stranger from there, when the discovery became tainted. Over the next eight years, the find set off a series of breakthroughs in tracking the “ghost bird,” as it is described in some Aboriginal storytelling. But it would take teams of Indigenous rangers, working with scientists in Australia’s most unforgiving and remote landscapes, to accelerate the discovery of more night parrot populations in recent months — a feat that may ultimately help to save the species. The night parrot was long considered the holy grail of Australian birding. Mr. Young captured photographic proof at a cattle station in the Australian state of Queensland that the parrot still lived. When he presented his pictures at the Queensland Museum, his discovery elicited “collective gasps and murmurs,” according to Australian Geographic magazine. Mr. Young had a history of making questionable claims. In 1980, he claimed to have rediscovered the extinct paradise parrot, but could not produce evidence. In 2006, he announced the discovery of a new species, the blue-fronted fig parrot; but the authenticity of his photographs was questioned. When asked later about his history of making unproven claims, Mr. Young once said, “I didn’t know it was a crime to get excited about a find and slightly exaggerate.” (He declined to be interviewed for this article.) His night parrot triumph brought a measure of redemption — for a while. News reports heralded Mr. Young’s find. In 2016, he became a senior field ecologist at the Australian Wildlife Conservancy. But scandal was never far away. In 2018, Mr. Young supplied his night parrot photograph to Audubon Magazine, which was profiling him; the photo had been published before but this version was uncropped. The magazine’s readers noticed aviary mesh in the corner of the photo, and accusations followed that he had illegally and excessively detained the bird, and possibly even injured it. He denied the accusations. Mr. Young had truly found the night parrot. But an independent review found that he had faked audio recordings of the birds, and that one of his photographs of a possible night parrot nest contained fake eggs. Mr. Young resigned from his post. While the disputes of Mr. Young’s methods played out, other investigators were conducting their own search for the night parrot. It’s hard to imagine a more elusive bird to track than the night parrot. The nocturnal, ground-dwelling birds shelter amid thick clumps of dry, spiky grass in Australia’s most isolated and harshest regions — some more than 1,000 miles from the closest city. Until Mr. Young’s discovery, almost everything scientists knew about the night parrot came from amateur ornithologists’ 19th-century diary entries and a small number of museum specimens. The English explorer Charles Sturt, on an 1845 expedition in southwestern Queensland to find a mythic inland sea in the center of Australia, “flushed a ground parrot,” that was, he wrote, “dark green speckled black. It rose and fell like a quail.” John Gould, an English ornithologist, formally described the night parrot in 1861. Expeditions sought the bird, but few were successful. In the 1870s, Frederick Andrews, who worked for the South Australian Museum, collected more than a dozen specimens across the arid north of the state. Then the trail went cold. There were sightings, but none confirmed. A night parrot carcass was found in western Queensland in 1990, and another in 2006. In 2012, Smithsonian Magazine placed the night parrot at the top of its list of the world’s most mysterious bird species. In the two years after Mr. Young’s initial discovery, scientists had recorded calls by night parrots, but “we only knew about a pair of birds,” said Nick Leseberg, a night parrot researcher and a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Queensland. “Seriously — two night parrots in the universe.” That changed in 2015. A group of scientists on an expedition, funded by a mining company, and led by Steve Murphy, an ecologist and night parrot expert, found a small number of night parrots close to the site of Mr. Young’s discovery. The following year, Dr. Murphy managed to attach a GPS tag to one of the birds; the battery lasted just over 11 minutes, but it was enough to briefly capture the movements of one of the world’s rarest birds. It revealed that prime night parrot habitat in Queensland consisted of areas of tussock grass called triodia that had been long untouched by fire, and close to water sources and seed-rich floodplains. (Triodia is commonly called “spinifex” in Australia, but comes from a different family of grasses.) Night parrots are extremely vocal, particularly just after sunset when they forage for food and water, and just before sunrise. In 2016, Mr. Leseberg, working with Dr. Murphy, stationed audio recording equipment in areas of western Queensland where night parrots might be present. Using these and earlier recordings, Mr. Leseberg programmed software to recognize night parrot calls — the haunting, two- or three-whistles the parrots use when leaving their roosts, the frog-like croak as they fly — from thousands of hours of recordings. While these scientists were making progress identifying small night parrot populations, other groups were gaining ground, too. In 2017, Indigenous rangers in Paruku, a protected area in Western Australia, photographed a night parrot using a camera trap. Their discovery sparked new interest in night parrots among Aboriginal ranger groups across the state. Australia has vast swaths of Indigenous protected areas: land and sea preserved for conservation and cultural purposes, which are owned and managed by a variety of Aboriginal groups. Indigenous ranger programs aim to protect these areas’ biodiversity, and rely on cultural knowledge of the land — much of which is passed down from community elders. Clifford Sunfly is a 27-year-old ranger from Ngururrpa, an 11,500-square-mile area of protected Indigenous land in the Great Sandy Desert of Western Australia. It is due south of Paruku, where camera traps had captured photos of a night parrot. The youngest ranger in his community, Mr. Sunfly grew up watching nature documentaries by Sir David Attenborough. He was the first person from Ngururrpa to graduate from high school. And he just became the first ranger in his community to see a night parrot. Ngururrpa is six hundred miles from the nearest town. But if the number of bird calls recorded there is any indication, it may contain the largest known population of night parrots. After the Paruku discovery in 2017, the number of known night parrot populations grew incrementally at first — a handful in the desert’s south, a few more hundreds of miles away in the north. But in 2018, a new collaborative approach changed everything. Western Australian ranger groups invited Mr. Leseberg and Dr. Murphy to a gathering in Balgo, a community on the northern edge of the Great Sandy Desert, to help the rangers’ expeditions. The scientists explained the sort of habitat where the rangers might find night parrots, and taught them how to set up the audio recorders. After that, the number of newly discovered populations has increased dramatically. The first night parrot calls were detected on Ngururrpa in 2019; there are now 14 known night parrot populations in Western Australia. In August, Neil Lane, a ranger on Martu country, hundreds of miles southwest of Ngururrpa, became the first Indigenous ranger to see a night parrot after searching in a site that his community elders had identified. “They know the country,” Mr. Lane, 36, said. Surrounded by red sandhills, he got down from the vehicle and a night parrot flew up from a clump of spinifex. Other rangers arrived, formed a line and walked through the grass. They flushed the bird again, and everyone saw it. In November, a team of Ngururrpa rangers, including Mr. Sunfly, mounted a night parrot expedition after the audio recorders detected thousands of calls. The rangers braved wildfires and floods to reach their destination. Shortly after sunset on the second night, Mr. Sunfly became the first Ngururrpa ranger to see a night parrot. “It flew across me,” he said. “It was flying real quiet. But I heard the flapping of the wings. Then I saw its outline in the stars.” While the rangers are not scientists, they are “highly attuned to, and acutely aware of, all aspects of the environment” that their people were living in over millenniums, Dr. Murphy said. “The observational-based science that they built up was incredibly detailed.” It’s time to recognize that there are other experts, like the community elders and the rangers, said Malcolm Lindsay, a program manager at Environs Kimberley, a nonprofit working with ranger groups in the Great Sandy Desert. “Their approach is more holistic,” he said. “Yes, they want to conserve the night parrot, but also protect their cultural knowledge, practice, communities and landscapes that sustain the birds.” Despite recent breakthroughs, night parrots remain critically endangered. As few as 15 birds survive in Queensland, Mr. Leseberg said. Most of these are in the 217-square-mile Pullen Pullen Reserve, which is run by the nonprofit Bush Heritage Australia, in the state’s west. “Every time I go out there, I go to the hill where they were last time, I wait for sunset, and I hold my breath,” said Mr. Leseberg. “We always find them in the end, but your heart is always in your mouth.” The situation is more promising in Western Australia, but even there, the birds’ future is uncertain; there may be fewer than 250 night parrots spread across an area larger than Minnesota. On Ngururrpa, Mr. Sunfly and his fellow rangers found not just night parrots, but also tracks left by cats. Feral cats kill an estimated 272 million Australian birds each year, and Mr. Leseberg believes that cats kill most young night parrots. “When there’s a big distance between small populations, stochastic events” — like a wildfire, or a rise in the number of feral cats — “can knock them out really quickly,” he said. In the meantime, ranger involvement is not just helping the night parrot. The programs are also reconnecting remote desert communities to traditional lands like Ngururrpa. As more rangers became involved, traditional stories about the night parrot are emerging. “They used to say to us, ‘You hear that? Someone’s whistling for you’. They did it to scare us when we were naughty,” said Kathryn Njamme, a Ngururrpa ranger widely respected for her traditional knowledge, of the night parrot stories she used to hear. “We feel happy to be back out on country,” said Ms. Njamme, 48. “Our spirits belong to this country and our work out here is looking after the land. We want to get all the young people out on country so that the next generation can take over.” In the ongoing search for the night parrot, Mr. Sunfly has learned from both the scientists and his own community. “We use technology to help pinpoint where the night parrots might be,” he said. “But we ask the old people everything. Everything comes from the old people.”"

Over the next few years, several columnists wrote that Silicon Valley shouldn’t be blamed for Theranos. Last month, Keith Rabois, a venture capitalist, said on Twitter that articles connecting Theranos with Silicon Valley culture contained “more fabrication than anything ever uttered by Trump.” The technorati in Silicon Valley and beyond have long tried to separate themselves from Theranos, the blood testing start-up in Palo Alto, Calif., that was exposed for lying about its abilities. But the fraud trial of the company’s founder, Elizabeth Holmes, has shown that just as Bernard Madoff was a creature of Wall Street and Enron represented the get-rich-quick excesses of the 1990s, Theranos and its leader were very much products of Silicon Valley. The usual refrain went like this: Theranos was more a health care company than a tech company. It raised money from wealthy families and people outside the tech industry, while insiders saw through the hype. But testimony and court exhibits in Ms. Holmes’s nearly four-month trial, which was capped on Monday when a jury found the entrepreneur guilty of four of 11 counts of fraud, starkly underlined her participation in Silicon Valley’s culture. Ms. Holmes, 37, used the mentorship and credibility of tech industry big shots like Larry Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle, and Don Lucas, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, to raise money from others. She lived in Atherton, Calif., amid Silicon Valley’s elite and was welcomed into their circles. She also used the start-up playbook of hype, exclusivity and a “fear of missing out” to win over later investors. She embodied start-up hustle culture by optimizing her life for the maximum amount of work. She dismissed the “haters” and anything that interfered with her vision of a better world. She parroted mission-driven technobabble. She even dressed like Steve Jobs. No industry wants to be judged only by its worst actors. And many venture capitalists who heard Ms. Holmes’s impossibly lofty claims didn’t fall for them. But if anyone in Silicon Valley was suspicious of her proclamations, none spoke publicly about it until after things went south. Immediately after The Wall Street Journal exposed Ms. Holmes’s alleged fraud at Theranos in 2015, some prominent tech investors even rushed to defend her in a bit of kneejerk tribalism. Even the judge who oversaw Ms. Holmes’s case, Edward J. Davila of U.S. District Court in San Jose, Calif., agreed that Silicon Valley culture was an essential piece of her trial. He allowed her lawyers to discuss the tech industry’s overly optimistic puffery as part of her defense. “It’s common in Silicon Valley for promoters to engage in that type of conduct,” Judge Davila said in a hearing in May before the trial began. At its best, Silicon Valley is optimistic. At its worst, it is so naïve it believes its own hogwash. Throughout her trial, Ms. Holmes’s lawyers argued she was simply a wide-eyed believer. Any statements that weren’t entirely truthful, they said, were about the future. It was what investors wanted to hear, they said. “They weren’t interested in today or tomorrow or next month,” Ms. Holmes testified. “They were interested in what kind of change we could make.” Soon after Theranos got started in 2003, Ms. Holmes used her vision of the future to win over investors and advisers like Mr. Ellison and Mr. Lucas. Mr. Lucas, who was chairman of Theranos’s board until 2013, was involved with more than 20 investment vehicles that backed Theranos. Those included his son’s venture firm, Lucas Venture Group; another vehicle, PEER Venture Partners; and trusts and foundations associated with members of his family. Mr. Lucas introduced Hall Group, a real estate firm that put $4.9 million into Theranos, to Ms. Holmes. His nephew’s firm, Black Diamond Ventures, invested $5.4 million. Other Silicon Valley investors included ATA Ventures and Beta Bayview, a fund operated by Crosslink Capital. Mr. Lucas and his son have since died. The Lucas Venture Group didn’t respond to a request for comment. Dixon Doll, founder of the Silicon Valley investment firm DCM, also invested, as did Reid Dennis, founder of the venture firm IVP, which has backed tech companies such as Slack, Twitter and Snap. Draper Associates, founded by the venture capitalist Tim Draper, also invested in Theranos, as did two funds operated by his other firm, Draper Fisher Jurvetson. A DCM representative said Mr. Doll had left the firm more than eight years ago, and a spokeswoman for DFJ declined to comment.  In a statement, Mr. Draper said Ms. Holmes’s verdict concerned him because it suggested that America’s spirit of entrepreneurship was in jeopardy. “A willingness to bet on these entrepreneurs and their visions has made Silicon Valley the innovation engine of the world,” he said. Not everyone who heard Ms. Holmes’s pitch was wowed. Bijan Salehizadeh, an investor at Highland Capital Partners, said he did not invest in Theranos in 2006 because Ms. Holmes was unwilling or unable to answer most of his questions. But as Theranos’s fund-raising made headlines, Mr. Salehizadeh questioned his judgment. Venture capitalists who hung out at the Rosewood Hotel on Sand Hill Road, one of Silicon Valley’s main arteries, in Menlo Park, Calif., began buzzing about the company, he said. “They were like: ‘This hot Theranos thing — you as a health care guy saw it and didn’t do it? How could you have possibly passed on a unicorn if it was sitting in your office at the earliest stages?’” he said. Ms. Holmes used that hype to reel in bigger checks from wealthy families, including heirs to the Amway, Walmart and Cox Enterprises fortunes. Industry insiders also offered their endorsement. The media mogul Rupert Murdoch met Ms. Holmes at a Silicon Valley gala hosted by Yuri Milner, a tech investor. Mr. Milner praised Ms. Holmes to Mr. Murdoch, according to “Bad Blood,” a book by John Carreyrou, a former Wall Street Journal reporter. Brian Grossman, an investor at the heath care-focused hedge fund PFM Health Sciences, learned about Theranos through Thomas Laffont, a co-founder of Coatue Management, a prominent investment fund with a San Francisco presence. In an email that was part of the court filings, Mr. Laffont gushed that Theranos had “one of the most impressive boards I’ve ever seen” and said Mr. Grossman’s firm should let him know “ASAP” if it was interested in an introduction. Coatue did not respond to a request for comment and PFM Health Sciences declined to comment. As Theranos brought in more shareholders, Ms. Holmes tightened her grip on the company, ensuring she would control the voting power even if the start-up went public. Chris Lucas, founder of Black Diamond Ventures, explained on a call with other investors, which was recorded and played in court, that this was typical for such companies. Ms. Holmes’s supervoting shares were “just like some of the other high-flying companies in Silicon Valley,” he said. In 2014, DFJ bragged about its investment in Theranos on Facebook. “Proud to have backed Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos for over a decade, as her very first investor,” the firm wrote. The next year, when Mr. Carreyrou was investigating Theranos’s claims for The Journal, Ms. Holmes embraced Silicon Valley’s favorite form of deflection: Label anyone who asks hard questions a hater. Before Mr. Carreyrou published his first exposé about Theranos, Ms. Holmes and her partner at the time, Ramesh Balwani, who was the start-up’s chief operating officer, poked fun at the reporter’s French heritage. “Proud cynic,” Ms. Holmes wrote in a text message to Mr. Balwani. “Cynicism and skepticism are diabetes of the human soul,” Mr. Balwani responded. “No one should be proud of diseases.” After the Journal article was published, Ms. Holmes used a rebuttal embraced by many in the tech industry. “This is what happens when you work to change things,” she said in a TV interview. “First they think you’re crazy, then they fight you, and then all of a sudden you change the world.” In the years since Theranos collapsed, more tech start-ups have followed its strategy of looking outside the small network of Sand Hill Road venture capital firms for funding. Start-ups are raising more money at higher valuations, and deal-making has accelerated. Mutual funds, hedge funds, family offices, private equity funds and megafunds like SoftBank’s Vision Fund have rushed to back them. Mr. Salehizadeh said Silicon Valley’s shift to a focus on fund-raising over all else was one reason he had left to set up a private equity firm on the East Coast. The big money brought more glitz to tech start-ups, he said, but it had little basis in business fundamentals. “You’re always left feeling like either you’re an idiot or you’re brilliant,” he said. “It’s a tough way to be an investor.”"

A jobless man, hard on his luck, has emerged as the central suspect. Zandile Christmas Mafe, 49, who liked to talk politics with friends, was charged on Tuesday with arson, theft, housebreaking and possession of explosives. Police said they spotted and arrested Mr. Mafe at the Parliament complex in Cape Town shortly after the fire was reported on Sunday. Prosecutors said he was caught with stolen laptops, documents and crockery. He was also charged with breaking state security laws, because the Parliament buildings are a site of national strategic importance. The sudden destruction of historic buildings that housed the National Assembly, and the offices of lawmakers, the governing African National Congress party and several opposition parties, has set off widespread confusion and speculation in a politically divided country. South Africa is still on edge after a wave of rioting last July, which resulted in the deaths of more than 300 people. On short notice, members of Parliament held a virtual meeting for more than three and a half hours on Tuesday, where lawmakers echoed concerns raised by the public: Were maintenance and safety protocols in the buildings too lax? Did the sprinklers fail? Why has the Parliament’s Protection Services been left without a permanent head since 2015? And have police and prosecutors found the actual culprit? “Why would a ‘vagrant’ wakeup and burndown parliament?” tweeted Fikile Mbalula, the minister of transport and a senior member of the A.N.C. The speaker of Parliament, Nosiviwe Mapisa Nqakula, said she believed the fire was no accident. Mr. Mafe appeared only briefly in a packed magistrates’ court, not far from the gutted parliamentary complex in the city center, disheveled in a faded long-sleeved gray shirt with denim shorts and dirty sneakers. Standing behind a thick plastic screen, in place for pandemic regulations, he lowered his mask, allowing reporters to see his face. He did not enter a plea, although his lawyer, Luvuyo Godla, said he plans to plead not guilty. He remains in custody, and prosecutors have opposed bail, citing the severity of the charges. Mr. Godla said his client denied setting the fire or carrying an explosive device, and accused the government of scapegoating a poor man to find a suspect quickly and distract from its own failure to protect its buildings. “What interest would that poor man have in Parliament?” Mr. Godla said, speaking to reporters on the steps of the court. Prosecutors, however, say that they are certain they have the right man. “He’s got a case to answer for,” Eric Ntabazalila, a spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority, said in a telephone interview. “Based on the evidence, we went to court.” He said that more charges were likely to be filed by the next court appearance. That is scheduled for Jan. 11, to allow investigators to access the site, which remains dangerous. Inside the small, corrugated iron shack where Mr. Mafe lives in the township of Khayelitsha, 20 miles southeast of Cape Town’s city center, neighbors said the television, satellite dish and refrigerator he owned had raised suspicion. “He had things that people in the area who work don’t have,” said Patrick Nkwela. “How do you explain that?” Several neighbors said Mr. Mafe had only moved into the area in August of 2021. He lived alone and seemed to know no one. He could also always afford alcohol, they said, which he drank alone. He did not work but never missed his rent, said Wendy Luhabe, his next-door neighbor. In Langa, a township in Cape Town where Mr. Mafe had lived for five years before moving to Khayelitsha, neighbors had a different impression of him and were surprised that he was accused of having anything to do with the Parliament fire. They remember Mr. Mafe as respectful and timid. They called him by his middle name, Christmas, or just Chris. He liked to talk about current affairs and decried corruption, but never in a way that felt threatening. A friend, Doreen Lekoma, said he’d worked for a bread factory but had lost that job earlier in 2021. When she bumped into him in July, she said, he looked disheveled, and was carrying an ironing board and other belongings. She said she had seen him again on Dec. 26, and he had looked hungry and confused, so she gave him a meal. His former girlfriend, Mbinde Andoni, said she last saw him on Christmas Day. The next time she saw him was in news footage from court, and she was shocked to see he was wearing the same gray shirt and denim shorts. “He was clearly sleeping on streets. How would he know how to get into Parliament, what important areas and documents to burn? It doesn’t add up,” said Ms. Andoni. As South Africans watched smoke billow from the entrance of the National Assembly, its chambers gutted and roof collapsed, the sense of unease from the July unrest returned. “The trust deficit between South African citizens and the government is just yawning at this point,” said Ziyanda Stuurman, an independent security analyst and a former researcher at Parliament. The state has yet to provide a “satisfactory answer” about the July unrest, and yet again, politicians are seen to be deflecting questions about security, instead of winning public confidence, she added. Opposition politicians raised questions about why the sprinkler system reportedly kicked in only after firefighters had arrived on the scene. A parliamentarian belonging to a faction aligned with the former president, Jacob Zuma, demanded to see security camera evidence of the suspect entering Parliament, and circulated an image said to be Mr. Mafe, in the same clothes he wore in court, asleep on a Cape Town sidewalk. Others questioned the timing of the fire — just days before the president and Parliament were to receive the first part of a report of a large-scale commission looking into corruption under the government of Mr. Zuma, the former president. On Tuesday, President Cyril Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma’s former deputy and now rival, received the first part of the report and made it public. The fire decimated the interior of a complex made up of three conjoined buildings built between the 1880s and expanded more than a century later, spanning the country’s transition from colony to apartheid regime to constitutional democracy. More than 60 firefighters battled the blaze, supported by crew from South Africa’s Air Force. At one point, the wind was so strong that firefighters pulled what one official called “death-defying Spider-Man moves,” climbing up the side of the building to prevent the fire from sweeping into Tuynhuys, the official office of the president."

Djokovic, the men’s tournament’s defending champion, revealed his plans in a post on his Instagram account alongside a photograph of himself with luggage on an airport tarmac. “I’m heading Down Under with an exemption permission,” he wrote. “Let’s go 2022.” Tournament officials confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that Djokovic had received a medical exemption after a review of his application by two independent panels, a procedure that strongly suggests he remains unvaccinated. Djokovic’s participation in the Australian Open, the tennis season’s first major, was in doubt as recently as last week, when he reportedly withdrew from an event in Sydney. Djokovic, who has had Covid, has consistently refused to say whether he has been inoculated or intends to be. According to the rules for the Australian Open, all participants must be vaccinated against the coronavirus or apply for and receive a medical exemption from an independent panel of experts. In December, Djokovic’s father, Srdjan Djokovic, raised new questions about his son’s participation, and his vaccination status, when he suggested that Djokovic was unlikely to play in Australia “under these blackmails and conditions.” Those comments came only days before Novak Djokovic was named as a participant in the Australian Open by the tournament’s organizers when they released the entry list for the main draw. “Defending champion Djokovic will play for an incredible 10th Australian Open trophy — and a men’s record 21st major singles title — and will be the favorite in a draw which showcases 49 of the world’s top 50,” the tournament said in a statement announcing the field. But Craig Tiley, the chief executive of Tennis Australia, which hosts the tournament, quickly moved to clarify that Djokovic’s inclusion in the entry list was not a confirmation that he had agreed to be vaccinated, or that he would be allowed to enter Australia, which has some of the world’s most strict coronavirus protocols for foreigners. “As a matter of course, everyone goes on the entry list,” Tiley said in a local television interview at the time. “It’s not a commitment list about who’s exactly in the draw. That comes in several weeks’ time, when the actual list, and draw, gets finalized for the Australian Open.” The Open’s draw will be held Jan. 10. The tournament begins on Jan. 17."

A 40-mile stretch of the highway — one of the busiest travel corridors in the United States — came to a standstill overnight after a fast-falling snowstorm led to jackknifed tractor-trailers and hundreds of other accidents. Some people abandoned their cars. Many, including a U.S. senator, spent the night on the snowy highway. As people spent a sleepless night in driver’s seats and truck cabs, state troopers slowly trudged from person to person, helping when they could with supplies. Tow trucks dragged car after disabled car out of the ice. “It’s been so horrible,” Arlin Tellez, 22, said in an interview on Tuesday morning from her car on the highway in Caroline County, Va., about 80 miles south of Washington. She had been trapped there since 5 p.m. Monday without any food or water, and was layering on clothes she had in the car. “There’s just no way for us to know what’s actually happening,” she said. “When we tried to call the police, because at this point that was our only resource, they literally just told us to hang on tight.” The interstate reopened on Tuesday night after Virginia state officials said that they had been working to clear several hundred vehicles off I-95. With slick roadways still possible, the Virginia Department of Transportation said drivers should avoid unnecessary travel overnight and on Wednesday morning. “We were prepared for the storm that was predicted — a few inches of snow — but instead, Mother Nature sent more than a foot of snow to the Fredericksburg area,” Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia said at a news conference on Tuesday afternoon.  The Virginia State Police said they had not received any reports of injuries or deaths related to the storm, but the authorities around the Mid-Atlantic said it had caused at least five deaths. Officials said the storm began on Monday with rain, which would have washed away road salts, and quickly overwhelmed efforts to keep the highway clear. Rain turned to sleet and then snow, which fell at a rate of two inches an hour for four to five hours, according to Marcie Parker, a Virginia Department of Transportation engineer. “That was entirely too much for us to keep up with,” she told reporters on Tuesday. Cars and trucks slowed, and then stopped, on their way up and down hills. At least one tractor-trailer slid sideways across the highway. In some places, Ms. Parker said, four inches of ice froze underneath vehicles. Corinne Geller, a spokeswoman for the Virginia State Police, said the authorities had responded to more than 1,000 traffic crashes and more than 1,000 disabled or stuck vehicles statewide. “We don’t believe that accounts for the vehicles on the 95 stretch,” she said. The snowstorm trapped truckers, students, families and every stripe of commuter, including Tim Kaine, the junior U.S. senator from Virginia and a former Democratic nominee for vice president. His ordeal began at about 1 p.m. on Monday, as his normal two-hour commute to the Capitol was disrupted by the gathering accidents and snow. “I’m extremely tired,” Mr. Kaine said in a phone interview on Tuesday afternoon as he arrived in Washington, having spent more than 20 hours stuck in his vehicle. “I had to sleep in my car last night on an ice-packed interstate with a ton of other cars.” He said he left his car on for 30 minutes at a time to charge his phone, make calls and warm up, then turned it off to save gas and to sleep for 20 minutes or so, only to be wakened by the cold. When he wasn’t napping, Mr. Kaine said, he passed the time by sipping Dr Pepper, listening to SiriusXM radio and eating small wedges of an orange that another stranded driver had given him. He said he regretted his habit of skipping breakfast. “I’m going to walk into the office right now, and I’m going to drink some water,” he said. “And I’m going to eat some potato chips or something salty, and I’m going to use a restroom.” Meera Rao and her husband, Raghavendra Rao, said they received notice about traffic conditions only after 15 hours in Caroline County. “I never thought I would be on a road near Washington, D.C., and not be able to move my vehicle an inch or two,” Mr. Rao said. Around 9 a.m. on Tuesday, someone cleared an exit near their car and they were able to move.  “We saw so many accidents ourselves, I was just praying for all of them,” Ms. Rao said. Jen Travis, a marketing agency owner from Sterling, Va., said she, her husband and their 12-year-old daughter got stuck near Fredericksburg, Va., around 2:30 a.m., as they were returning from a vacation at Universal Orlando Resort. Their road trip began after two canceled airline flights in Florida. Ms. Travis, 42, said the family had no food since they stopped for dinner around 7 p.m. on Monday, and that she had not gone to the bathroom since then, either. “I’m telling you, my bladder is about ready to burst,” she said. “Then we’re in the middle of Covid,” she added. “How do you walk up to a random house and say, ‘Can we use your bathroom? By the way, can you take a PCR test?’” Filling stations and convenience stores did steady business, at least once drivers were able to get to them. An employee who answered the phone at a Sheetz gas station in Woodford, Va., on Tuesday afternoon said customers had been streaming in — many on foot, having walked about a quarter-mile from the highway. “We don’t have much of anything left,” said the employee, who gave only his first name, Jason. Asked whether the station was out of fuel, he said, “We’re about to be.” The bad weather also disrupted rail traffic in Virginia. An Amtrak train that was on its way to New York from New Orleans returned to the station in Lynchburg, Va., after coming to a stop north of there on Monday, according to passengers who said they had been told that downed trees were blocking the tracks. Malcolm Kenton, who was on his way to Washington from Greensboro, N.C., said Amtrak gave passengers the choice of leaving when the train returned to Lynchburg. Mr. Kenton disembarked and spent the night at a hotel. “The train ran out of food at 6 p.m.,” he said. “It wasn’t officially announced, but we started hearing discussion that some of the toilets weren’t working. We just weren’t willing to risk having to spend the night on a train with no food and no working toilets.” The storm caused problems around the region, burying parts of Virginia in more than 15 inches of snow, and knocking out power for hundreds of thousands of customers in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee. Monday’s storm led to the deaths of at least five people. In Maryland, two women and a man died after their vehicle collided with a snow plow, according to the Montgomery County Police Department. Local news outlets in Tennessee and Georgia reported that a child in each state had died after trees fell onto their homes. As agencies worked to clear the roadways, drivers finally started to move. Marvin Romero, 34, an audio-video field engineer from Brooklyn, N.Y., said on Tuesday that he was driving with his two daughters, 10 and 8, back from a family vacation in Florida when they hit traffic around 3 p.m. on Monday in Virginia. From about 10 p.m. until Tuesday morning, his Hyundai Tucson compact S.U.V. did not move. At one point, Mr. Romero gave his daughters sparklers to pass the time. At another, he wrapped them in blankets while they slept. “I knew I couldn’t leave my car on all night,” Mr. Romero said. “I was worried about food, gas, my daughters. How are they going to sleep? The closest hotel to us walking was an hour away.” As of 1:45 p.m. on Tuesday, Mr. Romero said that he was moving again. He still had a long drive ahead of him, according to his GPS. “It’s telling me 1 o’clock in the morning right now,” he said. "

So what should you do if you’re one of them? We spoke to physicians and infectious disease experts about the steps you should take after a positive test or if you find out you’ve been in close contact with an infected person. Here’s their advice. If you’re in public or around people when you get the bad news, put on a mask immediately. Then isolate yourself as quickly as possible, even if you don’t have symptoms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends isolating for at least five full days, followed by five days of wearing a mask around others, as long as you don’t have a fever and any other symptoms are improving. If you are seriously ill with Covid or have a weakened immune system, the C.D.C. recommends an isolation period of 10 to 20 days. If you have a fever, the agency advises you to stay home until the fever resolves. Read more about the new C.D.C. guidelines. If you are waiting for test results but have symptoms of Covid-19, the C.D.C. now recommends that you isolate anyway, regardless of vaccination status. If you live with roommates or family, try to separate yourself from other people (and animals) as much as possible. “You should take yourself out of society,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco. “Wall yourself up in a cocoon.” Isolating in a home with other people may be difficult, but do the best you can. That means staying in your room, away from other members of the household, even for meals. Someone should deliver food to your bedroom door if possible. If the home has more than one bathroom, designate one just for the infected person. If the infected person is a child or older person who needs assistance, both the caregiver and the infected person should wear a mask when the caregiver enters the room, and open the windows if possible. If others are in the house, always wear a high-quality mask when you leave your room. Everyone should mask up in shared spaces. After using a shared bathroom, disinfect the toilet seat and handle, as well as the faucet handles, soap dispenser, counter and light switch. Close the lid before you flush, and turn on the exhaust fan. Open windows to improve ventilation in shared areas. The people living in your household should take precautions, but they don’t need to panic about getting infected too, especially if they’re vaccinated and boosted. “The household rate of contracting Covid from someone is not 100 percent by a long shot, even with the more transmissible variants,” said Dr. Paul Sax, an infectious disease expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School. While it can help incrementally to continue to wipe down shared spaces, “the most important thing is keeping people from breathing air that is filled with germs,” said Tara Kirk Sell, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. If you have a HEPA air cleaner, place it in or outside your bedroom. If you’ve tested positive and feel well, you can take a walk outdoors and get fresh air. If you’re in a city where you will cross paths with other people, wear a mask and keep your distance. If you tested positive after taking a rapid home test, you may want to take a second home test using a different brand or go to a testing center to confirm the result. False positives aren’t common with home tests, but they can happen. Even so, you should assume the positive result is correct, wear a mask and avoid close contact with other people until you get retested. If your positive test came from a laboratory, a second test isn’t necessary. If you receive a negative test on your rapid home test, don’t use that as your sole basis for decision making. The C.D.C. advises that a negative result on a rapid home test does not rule out a Covid infection. To improve the results from an antigen test, the agency recommends testing twice over a three-day period with at least 24 hours and no more than 48 hours between tests. No. In most cases, you won’t know which variant of coronavirus you’ve caught and your lab test typically won’t tell you. In general, the guidance on isolation, monitoring and treatment does not change based on which variant infected you. Think about where you’ve been and who might have inhaled your germs. Contact your employer and let them know. Most workplaces have protocols in place for contact tracing when an employee tests positive. You also want to alert anyone with whom you’ve spent time, going back at least two days before you got tested or started having symptoms, said Dr. Sax. The C.D.C. defines a close contact as someone who was less than six feet from you for 15 minutes or more. It may feel overwhelming, or even shameful, to tell people about your positive test, said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. “A lot of people think it’s some failure if you get infected,” Dr. Jha said. “This is an incredibly contagious variant. A lot of people are going to get it. That is not a moral failure.” Don’t forget to tell your doctor too, particularly if you have an underlying medical condition, like high blood pressure or diabetes, that puts you at higher risk. If the infected person is a child, call your pediatrician. You also need to call your child’s school, as well as anyone they’ve had close contact with at play dates, parties or other activities. Monitor your symptoms. You can use a pulse oximeter to keep track of your blood oxygen levels. Most healthy people will get an oxygen reading around 95 to 99 percent. You should seek medical advice if the reading drops quickly or the level dips to 93 percent or lower. The devices can be less accurate for people with darker skin, so pay attention to the trend. If your reading drops by four points, it’s worth checking in with a doctor. You should also see a doctor if you take a turn for the worse, have trouble breathing or have any symptom that causes you concern. You can learn more in our story, Why Days 5 to 10 Are So Important When You Have Coronavirus. Ask your doctor if you are eligible for monoclonal antibodies, a treatment that can help your body fight Covid-19 and lower your risk for severe illness, particularly for people in a high-risk group. For monoclonal antibody therapy to be most effective, it needs to be given soon after diagnosis, even if you’re not feeling bad yet. If you don’t have a regular doctor, you can also contact the infectious disease clinic at your hospital and ask about the treatment, said Dr. Celine Gounder, an epidemiologist at N.Y.U. medical school. Only one monoclonal antibody treatment, sotrovimab made by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology, has performed well against Omicron in laboratory experiments. Although the supply of sotrovimab is very limited, the Biden administration is in talks with GlaxoSmithKline about securing more doses to be delivered by early next year. The Food and Drug Administration has authorized two different oral treatments for people who are vulnerable to becoming severely ill because they are older or have medical conditions such as obesity or diabetes. Paxlovid, developed by Pfizer, is authorized for high-risk patients age 12 and older, and is meant to be taken as 30 pills over five days. Another pill treatment from Merck, known as molnupiravir, has been authorized for people 18 and older, and is meant to be taken as 40 pills over five days. To calculate your five-day isolation period, count your first day of symptoms as Day 0. If you never had symptoms but have a confirmed positive test, count Day 0 as the day you tested. You can leave isolation after five days if you don’t have a fever and any symptoms you had are getting better. If your symptoms persist or get worse, if you are immunocompromised or are severely ill with Covid, consult with your health care provider about when to leave isolation, which may last between 10 and 20 days. After isolation, the C.D.C. advises that you keep wearing a mask around others for an additional five days. Don’t remove your mask to eat or drink around other people, don’t travel and don’t spend time around high risk people until the masking period has ended. Although the agency didn’t recommend testing after isolation, the new guidelines say people should take a rapid antigen test after the five day isolation period if they have “access to a test and want to test.” Vaccinated adults who had booster shots and fully vaccinated children don’t need to quarantine after a potential exposure, but they should get tested five days later and wear masks around other people for 10 days.  People who are unvaccinated should quarantine for five days after exposure and then get tested. Wear masks around other people for 10 days. This also applies to people who are eligible for booster shots but have not received them yet. The C.D.C. has said that unvaccinated students who are exposed to the virus do not need to miss school after a potential exposure as long as two tests taken during the next week are negative.

Early studies suggest antibodies from a past Covid infection alone are not a strong defense against Omicron. “Unfortunately, reinfection after people have had Covid before, can occur, and the protection of previous infections is very variable and unpredictable,” said Dr. David Rubin, the director of PolicyLab at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. “So some people seem to be very protected and don’t get Covid again, and other people can get it again and even get quite severe disease again.”"

It was a significant advancement. Before the tests existed, detection was done through ultrasounds and a number of blood draws over multiple visits. After the tests started in 2011, a number of other companies sought to enter the space — and to differentiate their products, they began to screen for rarer conditions. The screenings for Down syndrome are quite reliable, but an investigation has found that the newer, expanded tests are usually incorrect. Why do these tests end up being wrong, and what can be done about it?"

For months, they pressed Olympics officials for a conversation. The I.O.C., the body that oversees the Games, sidestepped at first. Eventually, officials from the committee agreed to meet — but only for an “active listening exercise,” not to share any information. And the talk would have to remain secret. Finally, late last month, the I.O.C. pulled out entirely from meeting with the activist group, the Coalition to End Forced Labor in the Uyghur Region. “While the I.O.C. will continue strengthening its work in relation to labor rights,” said the email from Magali Martowicz, the Olympic committee’s head of human rights, “we regret to conclude that your organization and the I.O.C. will not be able to engage in a dialogue this time as a result of differences in approach, including regarding scope, process and confidentiality.” Concerns about China’s human rights record loom over the country’s preparations to host the Winter Olympics in Beijing next month. World leaders and activists have focused on the authorities’ suppression of the predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority, in the western Xinjiang region, and allegations that Uyghurs are being pressed into forced labor. The United States, Britain, Canada and Australia have announced diplomatic boycotts. The I.O.C. has consistently deflected calls to exert more pressure on China — a lucrative market and an important financial and organizational partner for the Olympics — for its potential abuses. When Peng Shuai, a three-time Olympian, disappeared from public life after accusing a top Chinese leader of coercing her into sex, the I.O.C. held a video call with her and said she appeared to be safe, despite widespread global concern. When challenged on China’s suppression of civil liberties in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet, officials have argued that the Games are not political. But the correspondence between the I.O.C. and the anti-forced labor coalition, which was reviewed by The New York Times, shows how reluctant the committee is to engage Beijing’s critics even on issues directly related to the operation of the Games. Companies may be unable to guarantee that their products are not made with forced labor, especially given China’s restrictions on outsiders in Xinjiang. But the Olympic committee appears reluctant even to try, members of the coalition said — echoing the concerns of other human rights groups. “They either had nothing to say or show on due diligence on forced labor, or they were unwilling because they won’t cross swords with Beijing,” said Bennett Freeman, a former State Department official who sent the emails to the I.O.C. on the coalition’s behalf. As a result, he said, “it is really impossible at this point for the I.O.C. to rule out Uyghur forced labor content in Olympic-branded merchandise.” The I.O.C. has met with other human rights activists about the Chinese Communist Party’s crackdowns in Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang. But those activists later accused the I.O.C. of dismissing their concerns. The Olympic committee also met with Human Rights Watch in January 2021 but rebuffed the group’s requests for information about its due diligence procedures, said Minky Worden, the group’s director of global initiatives. The I.O.C. has proved more willing to engage with human rights concerns elsewhere, Ms. Worden said. In 2014, the I.O.C., under pressure from activists, prodded the Russian government to investigate claims of unpaid wages to workers who had helped build Winter Games venues in Sochi. Last year, the committee raised concerns with Japanese officials about conditions for construction workers ahead of the Tokyo Olympics. But, Ms. Worden said, “there’s a different system for China.” The Olympic committee has defended its approach to human rights concerns in China, arguing that sports are a tool to building a better world. In an emailed response to questions, it said it was willing to engage with critics, and it defended its sourcing practices, noting that it engages with suppliers and at times conducts audits. It said the organizing committee in Beijing, which is led by Chinese government officials, would release a report addressing responsible sourcing in mid-January. “It is our policy that the I.O.C. hears all concerns that are directly related to the Olympic Games,” the statement said. But “while generic concerns have been expressed in the past about Beijing 2022’s product sourcing, the I.O.C. has not been approached about any specific case or situation, including by the Coalition.” As for the failed meeting attempt, the I.O.C. said it had offered the activists terms for “a constructive engagement” and had been declined.  The Chinese government has denied any accusations of forced labor in Xinjiang, and companies that criticize Beijing’s human rights record have suffered fierce backlash from nationalistic Chinese consumers. Intel, the chip maker, apologized to Chinese customers last month after its announcement that it would avoid products and labor from Xinjiang provoked fury on Chinese social media.  Concerns about Uyghur forced labor largely revolve around the clothing industry, as Xinjiang supplies one-fifth of the world’s cotton or yarn. Investigations by The Times, The Wall Street Journal, Axios and others have found evidence linking China’s forced detention of Uyghurs — which has ensnared as many as one million people in internment camps and coercive labor programs — to the supply chains of leading fashion retailers. The I.O.C. also has ties to companies that use Xinjiang cotton. The committee’s official sportswear uniform supplier is Anta, a Chinese sportswear giant that has affirmed its commitment to Xinjiang cotton. In its emailed statement, the Olympic committee said it had recently carried out third-party audits for the uniforms to be provided by Anta and found “no issue” with forced labor. Pressure on companies to disentangle themselves from such potential abuses is growing. Last month, President Joseph R. Biden signed a bipartisan bill to ban the import of goods made “in whole or in part” in Xinjiang, unless companies could prove that they were not made with forced labor. Informal efforts to arrange a conversation between the I.O.C. and the Coalition to End Forced Labor in the Uyghur Region — a group of more than 300 organizations established last year — began in May, according to Mr. Freeman. Finally, in the fall, the Olympic committee invited the coalition to send a formal request to meet, which it did, on Oct. 8. Officials at first offered a written response instead. In an email on Oct. 29, Ms. Martowicz, the head of human rights, replied to Mr. Freeman to say that the I.O.C.’s sourcing policies banned forced labor. But she did not say how the I.O.C. enforced that ban, other than “from time to time” “engaging with our suppliers” — in other words, the companies themselves — “to request evidence of compliance.” Third-party checks, she added, were something the I.O.C. “will be looking at” in “coming months.” Critics say the I.O.C. has been slow to adopt a human rights framework, compared with corporations or even other global sports organizations, such as FIFA. The Olympic committee has adopted new requirements for host cities to uphold international standards on human rights, but those do not take effect until 2024. Three days after Ms. Martowicz’s email, the coalition asked again for a conversation. Finally, on Dec. 9, Ms. Martowicz said the I.O.C. would meet — with conditions. The talk would be a one-time event. It would be kept confidential before, during and after, the emails showed. And the I.O.C. would listen only. “For the sake of clarity, during the Exercise the I.O.C. will not be sharing information (other than what has already been shared) with the Coalition,” Ms. Martowicz wrote. Zumretay Arkin, program and advocacy manager at the World Uyghur Congress, a Uyghur rights group that is part of the coalition, said she found that condition laughable. “It just tells you that they don’t want to commit to changing things,” she said. On Dec. 14, Mr. Freeman reiterated the call for a two-way conversation and asked to be allowed to talk publicly about the meeting after it happened. A week later, the I.O.C. cut off discussions. Ms. Arkin said she had been skeptical all along about the I.O.C.’s willingness to meet with the coalition. She had participated in the previous, separate meetings between the Olympic committee and Uyghur, Tibetan and Hong Kong activists, which did not have confidentiality requirements, she said. Afterward, the activists had used those talks to further publicly criticize China. “There’s part of me that thinks,” she said of the I.O.C., “they don’t want to offend Beijing anymore.”"

As a play on his last name, he named it Wordle. But after the couple played for months, and after it rapidly became an obsession in his family’s WhatsApp group once he introduced it to relatives, Mr. Wardle thought he might be on to something and released it to the rest of the world in October. On Nov. 1, 90 people played. On Sunday, just over two months later, more than 300,000 people played. It’s been a meteoric rise for the once-a-day game, which invites players to guess a five-letter word in a similar manner as the guess-the-color game Mastermind. After guessing a five-letter word, the game tells you whether any of your letters are in the secret word and whether they are in the correct place. You have six tries to get it right. Few such popular corners of the internet are as low-frills as the website, which Mr. Wardle built himself as a side project. There are no ads or flashing banners; no windows pop up or ask for money. There is merely the game on a black background. “I think people kind of appreciate that there’s this thing online that’s just fun,” Mr. Wardle said in an interview on Monday. “It’s not trying to do anything shady with your data or your eyeballs. It’s just a game that’s fun.” This is not Mr. Wardle’s first brush with suddenly capturing widespread attention. Formerly a software engineer for Reddit, he created two collaborative social experiments on the site, called The Button and Place, that each were phenomena in their moment. But Wordle was built without a team of engineers. It was just him and his partner, Palak Shah, killing time during a pandemic. Mr. Wardle said he first created a similar prototype in 2013, but his friends were unimpressed and he scrapped the idea. In 2020, he and Ms. Shah “got really into” the New York Times Spelling Bee and the daily crossword, “so I wanted to come up with a game that she would enjoy,” he said. The breakthrough, he said, was limiting players to one game per day. That enforced a sense of scarcity, which he said was partially inspired by the Spelling Bee, which leaves people wanting more, he said. Word games have proved immensely popular for The Times and other companies in recent years, and many such as the Spelling Bee have developed devoted fan followings. But since Wordle was built originally for just Mr. Wardle and Ms. Shah, the initial design ignored a lot of the growth-hacking features that are virtually expected of games in the current era. While other games send notifications to your phone hoping you’ll come back throughout the day, Wordle doesn’t want an intense relationship. “It’s something that encourages you to spend three minutes a day,” he said. “And that’s it. Like, it doesn’t want any more of your time than that.” Wordle lacked the ability to share results until mid-December. Mr. Wardle noticed players sharing their results by typing out a grid of green, yellow and black emojis, so he built an automated way for players to brag about their successes in a spoiler-free way. If he were optimizing the game to gain as many players as possible, he would have included a link at the end of the tweet that the tool generates, he said. But after looking into it, he said it would have looked “trashy” and not as visually compelling, and he liked the grid’s mysterious air, which he felt piqued people’s interest. While Ms. Shah was the lucky recipient of the first game, she has played a key role in getting it ready for the public, Mr. Wardle said. An initial list of all of the five-letter words in the English language — about 12,000 — contained a lot of obscure words that would have been near impossible to guess. So he created another game for Ms. Shah: This time, she would sort through those 12,000 or so words, designating whether or not she knew them. That narrowed down the list of Wordle words to about 2,500, which should last for a few years. (Already, a few words have riled up the fans: Some were upset by REBUS and TAPIR, saying they were not familiar enough.) Ms. Shah says she wakes up every day with a new routine: She warms up with the Spelling Bee, which gets her mind right for Wordle. She also loves the New York Times Crossword and cryptic crosswords. Though Wordle is now shared with the world, she said she appreciated that Mr. Wardle originally created it for her. “It’s really sweet,” she said. “This is definitely how Josh shows his love.”"

The agreement was made public as part of a lawsuit filed by the woman, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, against Prince Andrew, who was friendly with Mr. Epstein and who Ms. Giuffre has said raped her when she was 17.  Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, has denied Ms. Giuffre’s allegations, and his lawyers are expected to argue at a hearing on Tuesday that her suit, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan, should be dismissed. Andrew B. Brettler, a lawyer for Prince Andrew, declined to comment on the terms of the 2009 settlement or its potential ramifications for Ms. Giuffre’s lawsuit against his client. Ms. Giuffre says in the suit that she was trafficked and abused by Mr. Epstein and others in his circle, including Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, starting when she was 16.  The prince, 61, was a friend of Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite and longtime companion of Mr. Epstein’s who was convicted last week of conspiring with him to recruit, groom and sexually abuse underage girls.  Ms. Giuffre’s suit against Prince Andrew, which seeks unspecified damages, accuses him of abusing her “at Epstein and Maxwell’s invitation” in New York. She says the prince also abused her in London and on an island Mr. Epstein owned in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Ms. Giuffre did not testify at Ms. Maxwell’s trial. Prince Andrew’s lawyers have argued that Ms. Giuffre’s suit against him is invalid, in part because of her 2009 settlement with Mr. Epstein. In addition to the sum she received, the filing unsealed on Monday shows her agreeing to drop claims against Mr. Epstein and anyone else “who could have been included as a potential defendant.”  In a statement on Monday, David Boies, a lawyer for Ms. Giuffre, said the details of the 2009 agreement were “irrelevant to Ms. Giuffre’s claim against Prince Andrew.” The settlement, Mr. Boies said, did not mention the prince by name and he “did not even know about it.”  Prince Andrew “could not have been a ‘potential defendant’ in the settled case against Jeffrey Epstein both because he was not subject to jurisdiction in Florida and because the Florida case involved federal claims to which he was not a part,” Mr. Boies said. Mr. Boies said that he and Ms. Giuffre’s other lawyers had sought the public release of the settlement filing to rebut claims made by Prince Andrew’s legal team. The prince’s lawyers have argued that Ms. Giuffre was seeking a “payday” by suing him.  A fund created by Mr. Epstein’s estate to compensate his victims has paid out at least $121 million to more than 135 people. Ms. Giuffre, who now runs a nonprofit group called Speak Out, Act, Reclaim, filed her suit against Prince Andrew almost exactly two years after Mr. Epstein killed himself in a federal jail in Manhattan while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges. He had been accused of sexually exploiting dozens of women and girls at his various homes.  Prince Andrew had stepped back from public life in 2019 after a disastrous interview with the BBC about his links to Mr. Epstein. Ms. Giuffre’s suit, which included a picture of her and the prince together, undermined his assertion in the interview that he could not recall meeting her.  The continuing questions about Prince Andrew’s conduct come at a difficult time for Britain’s royal family, which has endured a public rift within its ranks and is confronting worries about the health of Queen Elizabeth, 95, after the 2021 death of her husband, Prince Philip. Britain’s tabloid newspapers have seized on tensions within the royal household that were exposed in a series of interviews in which Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, described royal life as a kind of gilded prison and said that family members held retrograde views on race. Toward the end of last year, the queen canceled some engagements because of concerns over her health, but she did deliver her annual televised Christmas message. She made no mention of either Prince Harry’s decision to step down from duties as a senior member of the royal family or Prince Andrew’s legal battle.    "

On a recent morning, in a former bar converted into a community center, Assetou Elabo was arranging tables for students who would soon join her for homework tutoring.  A few years earlier, the bar’s owner had let drug trafficking proliferate on the site. With patrons, he would watch videos from the Islamic State. And in the basement of the bar, Les Béguines, he would chat online with a friend who had joined the terrorist group in Syria. Then in November 2015, he detonated his explosive vest as part of a series of attacks in and around Paris. For many, the bar epitomized all that had gone wrong in Molenbeek, the neighborhood of nearly 100,000 people that was home to 7 of the 20 terrorists who killed 130 people in France that November and 32 more in Brussels four months later. But if the bar symbolized what Molenbeek had been, the community center shows what the neighborhood is trying to become. Since being opened by local residents in 2018, the center has been dedicated to helping children, students looking for jobs and people with disabilities. Although the neighborhood remains predominantly Muslim, it is more diverse than usually portrayed, with newcomers changing its composition in recent years. “What we do here is the opposite of what the Abdeslam brothers did,” Ms. Elabo, a social worker, said of the bar’s owner, Brahim, and his brother Salah, who helped manage it. After the Paris attacks, Molenbeek was subjected to intense global scrutiny. Television crews from around the world broadcast for days from the neighborhood’s central square or near the bar, making residents feel like they were living on a movie set. Some journalists would stop passers-by and ask to be introduced to a jihadist. Opinion shapers and policymakers would exhort moderate Muslims to do more to combat extremism. Six years later, many in Molenbeek have taken up the challenge. And far from the public attention, they have tried to rebuild their community, although it still faces the same endemic problems — from poverty to unemployment to crime — that contributed to the radicalization of some residents. “We were ashamed after the attacks, but now I proudly say that I’m from Molenbeek,” said Dr. Sara Debulpaep, 47, a pediatrician who has lived here for nearly three decades. Yet as much as some residents want to put the stigma of the attacks behind them, the Molenbeek terrorists are once again in the news. For the past several months in Paris, a trial over the 2015 bombings and shootings has examined what went wrong in Molenbeek, presenting arguments about what drove the attackers and how their plan was allowed to so horribly succeed. In court, academics, lawyers and officials have debated for days the upbringing of the attackers and those accused of complicity. The reasons for the failure of Brussels police officers to monitor and arrest them has been dissected even more closely. Several defendants standing trial in Paris will also appear before a Brussels court in September for the attacks on the city in 2016. Dozens of Molenbeek residents, mostly young people, traveled to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside armed groups like the Nusra Front and ISIS in the early 2010s. At the continuing trial in Paris, one defendant said that upon his release from prison in 2014, his neighborhood felt empty: All his friends had gone to Syria and Iraq. Of the 20 men accused in the Paris attacks, seven grew up or lived in Molenbeek. So did one of ISIS’ top recruiters in Europe. Luc Ysebaert, the head of the local police, said around 50 people were still being monitored by intelligence services in the area. Since the attacks, the government has awarded numerous grants meant to improve life here and expand opportunities for the neighborhood’s young people. Bachir Mrabet, a youth worker at Foyer, one of the main community centers in Molenbeek, said he had begun news literacy workshops after the attacks, as well as theater workshops to let off tensions. He also now organizes youth meetings twice a month instead of once every two months before the bombings. “We’re much more vigilant,” he said. But resources are still tight, and residents still feel stigmatized, said Ali El Abbouti, another youth worker at Foyer who manages his own community center. “We’ve been asked to do even more, to solve all the problems, but with so little resources,” Mr. El Abbouti said. “And we were already doing so much.” He wants to create places where young people are encouraged to express themselves; recent projects have included a podcast in Arabic about the origins of Molenbeek’s first generations of Moroccan immigrants. Volunteers say young people need more guiding examples from older and successful local residents. “They want mentors, they don’t have that around them,” said Meryam Fellah, a 27-year-old chemistry student who provides coaching at the community center once housing the bar. Molenbeek’s major changes aren’t coming only from longtime residents, but also from some of the same outside forces that are reshaping much of Brussels. While residents of Moroccan origins remain a majority in Molenbeek, in recent years more Eastern Europeans, sub-Saharan Africans and Roma people have arrived. The neighbors of Dr. Debulpaep, the pediatrician, include Albanians, Congolese, Guineans, Italians, Poles and Palestinians. Residents say Molenbeek’s diversity is what makes it unique. For example, Molenbeek’s women’s soccer club last year included players from eight nationalities on one of its 12-person youth squads, said Imane El Rhifari, a coach. Some Molenbeek residents say they are now as annoyed by the arrival of Pentecostal churches in the area as they were once worried about some mosques fostering extremism. Affluent new residents from the Dutch-speaking Flanders region of Belgium have moved into expensive housing along a gentrifying strip of artists’ studios and organic shops. In Molenbeek, one can now visit an exhibition on Belgian adult movie theaters in one of Brussels’ trendiest museums. Art projects, underground concerts and cafes are gaining ground. But integrating those patrons and the customers of the kebab restaurants and traditional Islamic wedding shops that dot the neighborhood’s main street remains a challenge, residents say. “There’s very little mixing,” Mr. El Abbouti said on a recent afternoon as he walked past a gated residential complex. And Molenbeek remains one of the poorest and most densely populated areas in Belgium. At 21 percent, the unemployment rate is three times the country’s average. While the terrorist threat has been downgraded, cannabis trafficking has exploded, and so have violent clashes among gangs, said Mr. Ysebaert, the local police chief. “Our problems are very similar to those of large European cities.” During the pandemic, scores of young people have dropped out of school, quit playing sports or stopped going to community centers, youth workers and residents say. “After 16 years old, many give up, and we lose them,” said Touben Zouin, who counsels Molenbeek residents aged 16 to 25. There have been some success stories, too. Just months after the attacks, Ibrahim Ouassari, a local entrepreneur, opened a tech school dedicated to dropouts, where 30 percent of the 400 students trained every year come from the neighborhood. The school, Molengeek, has since grown into one of Belgium’s biggest tech successes, with branches in other Belgian cities, the Netherlands and Italy. Yet Mr. Ouassari conceded there is still a “culture of resignation” in Molenbeek which pushes some young people toward petty crime and which used to tilt some of them toward radicalization. “We haven’t dried up the fertile ground,” he said, “that creates desperate people.”"

The service members — including Navy SEALs and members of the Naval Special Warfare Command — had filed suit against the Biden administration arguing that their “sincerely held religious beliefs forbid each of them from receiving the Covid-19 vaccine for a variety of reasons based upon their Christian faith.” The Pentagon had mandated that all active-duty troops receive the vaccine. The judge, Reed O’Connor of the Northern District of Texas, effectively blocked the department from punishing those troops. “Our nation asks the men and women in our military to serve, suffer, and sacrifice. But we do not ask them to lay aside their citizenry and give up the very rights they have sworn to protect,” Judge O’Connor wrote in his 26-page order. He added: “The Covid-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no Covid-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.” The group represents a small fraction of active-duty troops from the United States, and as of mid-December, most active-duty soldiers and members of the Navy had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Thousands have requested religious exemptions, and none have been granted so far, officials said in December. The decision follows another injunction by a judge in November against President Biden’s national vaccine mandate for health care workers. Judge O’Connor, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, has reliably tossed several Democratic policies that have been challenged on the federal bench. In response to the injunction on Monday, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, wrote on Twitter, “This is a major win!” A spokesperson for the Pentagon could not immediately be reached for comment. But on Monday evening, John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said that defense officials were reviewing the injunction, according to The Washington Post."

Hammond is a pioneering chemical engineer who has researched cancer and other illnesses at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for years. Her work, people in her field said, makes her a natural pick to sit on the board of a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company. Yet it was only in 2020 that Dr. Hammond, who is Black and heads the chemical engineering department at her university, became a director of a publicly traded company. “That was my first time being approached to sit on a public board,” she said. With their ability to steer companies’ biggest decisions and pick key executives, boards wield crucial power in American business and society. They have long been overwhelmingly white and male. Executives and recruiters have often complained that there aren’t enough women and nonwhite people qualified to be directors, a phenomenon often described as a “pipeline” problem. But under pressure to achieve more diversity in senior ranks — from advocates for social change and, at times, their own employees — companies appear to be discovering that a big talent pool of nonwhite people and women for board seats does, in fact, exist. Some, like Dr. Hammond, have been hiding in plain sight. Directors who are Black, Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern or from another nonwhite ethnic group now occupy 4,500 board seats among companies in the Russell 3000 stock index, 25 percent more than they did at the end of 2020 and nearly 50 percent more than at the end of 2019. Those numbers come from an analysis by ISS Corporate Solutions, which advises businesses on corporate governance, executive pay and social and environmental issues. Directors from underrepresented groups occupy 17 percent of board seats, up from 14 percent in 2020, the ISS Corporate Solutions data shows. Women, of all races, have also made gains. They now account for 27 percent of all directors, up from 24 percent. Dr. Hammond’s experience and that of other newly appointed board members suggest there are many more qualified candidates who have been overlooked by companies and executive recruiters. “The biggest problem is that people had not spent enough energy focusing on finding people who could be great candidates for boards,” said Freeman A. Hrabowski III, president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and a longtime member of the boards of T. Rowe Price, the investment firm, and McCormick, the spice and seasoning company. Serving board members have the job of seeking out new directors — and a reason boards are so white and male is that they seek directors who have had experience at the highest levels in corporate America, a group that until the last decade or two has been largely white. Critics of corporate board recruiting also argue that executives tend to prefer recruiting from their own professional and social circles, or on the basis of recommendations from associates and friends. Though the number of white directors fell slightly in 2021, they still account for eight of every 10 board members, and six of 10 are white men. Dr. Hrabowski, who is Black, said that while some companies had worked hard to make their boards more representative of the U.S. population, there was still a long way to go. “It’s fair to say companies are being more creative in finding candidates today,” he added. The recent influx of nonwhite and female directors occurred after the killing of George Floyd in May 2020, and the outpouring of anger and frustration that followed. That prompted many companies to pledge to make changes to address racial injustice and inequity. California, where many companies are based, passed laws that require greater diversity on corporate boards — and these appear to have had an impact. One, passed in 2018, requires boards of public companies with their principal executive office in the state to have at least two female directors, and the other, passed in 2020, says boards must have one or more directors from an “underrepresented community,” which includes people of several races and ethnic groups and people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. Other states have introduced legislation that would require boards to have a certain number of women. In 2021, Black directors were named to fill 535 board seats, to raise their total to 1,919, a nearly 40 percent increase, according to the ISS Corporate Solutions analysis. They now account for 7.4 percent of directorships, up from 4.5 percent at the end of 2019. But directors from other underrepresented groups did not fare as well. The number of Hispanic people on boards, for example, went up 15 percent, yet they make up only 3 percent of the total, far shy of their 18.5 percent share of the population. “It is still not — as you can see from the numbers — growing at the level that it needs to,” said Esther Aguilera, chief executive of the Latino Corporate Directors Association. She added, “We celebrate all diverse appointments, but Latinos are being left behind.” When companies have recently gone looking for qualified directors from underrepresented groups, they have often found strong candidates. Take Dr. Hammond. She is a leading cancer researcher and an expert in the materials that help take drugs to specific parts of the body. “She is a shining example of someone who would have been overboarded a long time ago,” said Terry McGuire, a venture capitalist, using a term for people who sit on a lot of corporate boards. Mr. McGuire is on the board of Alector, a biotech company trying to develop treatments for Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and other brain disorders. In 2019, he suggested that Dr. Hammond consider joining, too, which she did in March 2020. Soon after Alector announced her appointment, several other companies asked if she’d join their boards, Dr. Hammond said. But she declined in part because she felt she would be stretched too thin; she is also on President Biden’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Asked why she thought she hadn’t been approached earlier, Dr. Hammond said, “My guess would be that many knew me but just didn’t think about whether I might be helpful from the perspective of a board member.” People pushing for greater diversity on boards say companies need to expand their searches beyond current and former senior business executives, and emphasize skills over title. “If you look around, everyone wants a sitting or recently retired C.E.O. who’s done very similar things to what their company’s trying to do sometime in the last decade,” said Jennifer Tejada, chief executive of PagerDuty, a software company, and a member of the boards of Estée Lauder and UiPath, a software company. “That’s a very narrow lens to look through.” Under her leadership, PagerDuty’s eight-member board has just two white directors. She emphasized that she hadn’t had to settle for lesser candidates to have a diverse board. Her directors, she noted, include the dean of engineering at the University of Michigan, Alec D. Gallimore, who is Black; Bonita Stewart, who is a board partner at Gradient Ventures, an investment arm of Google, and the first Black woman to be a vice president at Google; and Rathi Murthy, who is Indian and a top technology executive at Expedia Group. To ensure there are enough board candidates from a variety of backgrounds, companies need to do a better job promoting more people from underrepresented groups into senior roles, some executives said. That is especially true of increasing the number of Hispanic board members, said Elena Gomez, the chief financial officer of Toast, a software company, who is on PagerDuty’s board. “What we need to do is get more Latinx people into those management roles, and that starts deeper in how you recruit and train,” Ms. Gomez said. But the push to make boards more diverse has led to a backlash by some conservatives and libertarians. Some are suing to overturn the California laws, arguing that the state is illegally restricting the right of shareholders to select and vote on directors based on merit and skill. “A coercive quota is being imposed on these companies,” said Daniel Ortner, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation. The foundation is representing the National Center for Public Policy Research, a group that says it promotes free-market policies, in a lawsuit challenging the law that requires directors from underrepresented groups. Proponents of greater diversity argue that female and nonwhite board members bring different experience and knowledge, especially about markets and customers that existing directors might not know well. That should, over time, lead to greater profits, higher sales and better morale among employees. “As a mathematician, I always emphasize the importance of problem solving,” Dr. Hrabowski, the university president, said. “And when you have more people in the room with different perspectives, who solve problems in different ways, you get a broader set of solutions.” Dorika Beckett, the chief executive of private health care companies, joined the board of Velocity Financial, a publicly traded mortgage company, in 2020. She said her contributions to board discussions had been well received, adding that she can provide expertise that could help Velocity better serve Black borrowers. “That is something I think I can bring to the executive level,” Ms. Beckett said. Dr. Hammond said her experience as a department head at a top university had been useful in her work on Alector’s compensation committee, which oversees pay and hiring of senior officers. “I feel I can bring a perspective that involves the human side of managing extremely smart people in ways that are unique.”"

With that, here we go: The Omicron variant of the coronavirus struck at the most inconvenient time: just as millions of Americans were traveling for the Christmas and New Year holidays. Suddenly, family gatherings were once again shadowed by menace and risk of infection — but also by a new layer of uncertainty and confusion. All of which served to drive Americans to new heights of exhaustion with the toll the virus has taken on ordinary life. It remains a serious public health emergency, with daily coronavirus cases soaring into the hundreds of thousands. But the pandemic also presents difficult political choices for elected officials, from President Biden on down, just as election season begins in earnest. Democrats could enter the 2022 midterms as the responsible grown-ups who finally tamed a deadly scourge. Or, if Republicans succeed in branding mask and vaccine mandates as nanny-state overreach, voters could punish them in the fall. Most likely, both narratives will compete for attention as the virus itself casts the determining vote. “Everyone up and down the chain is frustrated,” said Frank Luntz, a Republican messaging expert who has spent the last year conducting focus groups on the virus. “And it just doesn’t seem to end.” There is no mistaking the signals that Americans are sending at this moment: But polls also show a deep divide between those vaccinated and not, and Omicron has barely budged the latter. “As a nation, we’re not experiencing the pandemic equally,” said Mollyann Brodie, who oversees polling for the Kaiser Family Foundation. While Omicron — so far — appears to be less vicious than its predecessors, the explosion of cases has evoked grim memories of early 2020, when the coronavirus ripped through unprotected American cities so quickly that health workers had to place corpses in refrigerated trucks. This time, public health officials are having to factor the public’s waning patience into their epidemiological calculations. When asked on CNN to explain why the Centers for Disease Control had reduced the recommended quarantine period from 10 to 5 days, Rochelle Walensky, the agency’s director, first walked through a number of scientific arguments. But she then acknowledged, “It really had a lot to do with what we thought people would be able to tolerate.” Scott Gottlieb, a former F.D.A. commissioner in the Trump administration, credits the Biden administration for its aggressive rollout of the vaccines, and in particular the speed with which it made booster shots available. Still, he said, its ostentatious displays of deference to “the science” have fed charges of hypocrisy whenever decisions appeared to incorporate other considerations. “The Biden administration kind of handcuffed itself coming in because of this narrative that all of the problems under Trump were created by interference in the scientific process,” he said. Now, he added, “I think they have buyer’s remorse.” Omicron’s arrival also has fostered a rare détente between the current president and his predecessor. When Trump recently told an audience in Dallas that he’d gotten a booster shot, some in the crowd began to boo. What happened next was fascinating: He didn’t back down. The booing, Trump said, was coming from “a very tiny group over there.” Then later, at the same event, he said, “We saved tens of millions worldwide by creating the vaccine.” “We should take credit for it,” he went on, nodding to politics. “You play right into their hands” — meaning Democrats — by questioning the vaccine, he warned. In his national address on the pandemic a day later, Biden credited “the prior administration” with speeding the development of a vaccine and noted Trump’s comments about the booster. Asa Hutchinson, the Republican governor of Arkansas, praised the move. “I thought that was a good effort at depoliticizing it,” he said. “And I think that helped.” Luntz urged the White House to put Biden and Trump together on television to promote vaccination. “The two of them should be speaking together in the Oval Office,” he said. We asked both camps, and it’s safe to say there are no plans to do so. Governors up for re-election must weigh two uncertainties: how much the public will tolerate the kinds of restrictions they imposed in the pandemic’s early days, and to what extent the shield wall provided by the vaccine will hold. Some Democrats are already recalibrating. In Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis last month declared the public emergency “over” and said local authorities could determine the measures necessary to keep people safe. As for the unvaccinated, he said, “At this point, if you haven’t been vaccinated, it’s really your own darn fault.” White House officials working on the pandemic say they don’t have that luxury. They closely monitor the number of daily vaccinations and puzzle over how to reach the unreachable. “We tried everything,” said one official who was not authorized to speak on the record. “We paid people; we built mass vaccination sites. At this point, we don’t have time to waste.” Biden campaigned on beating the pandemic and restoring a sense of normalcy. If he can’t do so, Democrats are likely to suffer in the fall. But there’s a chance the pandemic fades by November. Boosters are widely available, and they’re working. Children over five can get vaccinated. And for those who do get sick, treatments exist and are improving. Perhaps Omicron will prove the storm before the calm. “By early February, we could be in a place where Covid is, in fact, ‘like the flu,’” noted Bob Wachter, chair of medicine at the University of California San Francisco. The White House, mindful of the virus’s capacity to disappoint, is leery of anything that smacks of a premature declaration of victory. “One of the worst things we could do is set positive expectations and not meet them,” a second White House official said. Republican strategists see mandates as increasingly unpopular with suburban women, among other key segments of the electorate. Kristin Davison, who managed Glenn Youngkin’s successful campaign in Virginia, pointed to a “sweet spot”: “strongly encouraging people to get the vaccine, but not going so far as to mandate it.” “People are saying, ‘What the hell, we’re over it, come on’,” she said. “That’s where Democrats really are in danger.” And Gottlieb, the former F.D.A. commissioner, said Biden’s vaccine mandate for businesses created a fat political target that outweighed any vaccination gains. “You’re going to see governors run for president against vaccination mandates now,” he said. But for many Americans, who just want life to return to normal and are impatient for solutions, politics are part of the problem. “I’m not really optimistic” about the year ahead, said Ryan Henslee, 43, a father in Hemet, Calif., pointing to misinformation he said was preventing people from getting vaccinated and worsening the nation’s rifts. “If we don’t find a way to get on the same team,” he added, “it’s going to hurt our kids for a lifetime.”"

The European Commission said it had begun consultations with European Union countries on the proposal, which is intended to provide a common set of definitions of what constitutes a “sustainable investment” in Europe. Any final plan can be blocked by a majority of member states or by the European Parliament. “The Commission considers there is a role for natural gas and nuclear as a means to facilitate the transition towards a predominantly renewable-based future,” the statement, released on Saturday, said. The proposal caps one of the most heated political battles in Europe at a time when its leaders have pledged to pull the planet back from the brink of climate catastrophe. It follows months of intense lobbying pitting a pronuclear bloc led by President Emmanuel Macron of France, Europe’s biggest atomic power producer, over objections from Germany and other countries that are wary of a proliferation of nuclear power on European soil. A draft legal text circulated in Brussels over the weekend seeks to strike a middle ground. The proposal would deem natural gas and nuclear power as “transitional” green energy sources to be used to bridge countries’ moves away from coal and carbon-emitting power toward clean energy technologies like wind and solar. Nuclear power would be considered a sustainable investment if countries can safely dispose of radioactive waste — one of the biggest concerns for the German-led bloc. New plants would be considered sustainable investments through 2045 and would have to undergo safety upgrades during their lifetime to ensure “the highest achievable safety standards,” according to the draft. Natural gas plants would be deemed “transitional” green energy sources for investment purposes if they meet certain emissions criteria and replace more polluting fossil fuel plants. The European Union has been working to make sustainability and climate considerations an integral part of its financial rules in order to support the so-called Green Deal, which aims to make Europe a net-zero emitter of greenhouse gases by 2050. The rules are intended to drive private capital and public money to renewable investments and prevent “greenwashing,” when companies make irresponsible claims of helping clean the environment. Supporters say natural gas and nuclear can provide critical sources of electricity as economies transition toward cleaner sources like wind and solar, and new technologies like hydrogen power. But others say neither deserves to be considered a green investment, pointing to carbon dioxide emissions from burning natural gas and the environmental hazards of nuclear plants. The commission’s proposal is expected to face opposition from members of the European Parliament. Bas Eickhout, a Green lawmaker from the Netherlands, said that classifying natural gas as a green investment would mean “the entire climate leadership of the European Union is down the drain.” Mr. Eickhout added: “It would also send the wrong signal to the world. If Europe starts calling an investment in gas green, then what exactly is the reason for the African Union not to go fully into gas as well?” He said the debate has become “a proxy fight” among national leaders for the future of energy in the bloc.  Of the two technologies, however, nuclear power has arguably been the most politically fraught issue. France led a coalition this year that included nations in Eastern Europe — the continent’s most coal-dependent region — to get nuclear energy and natural gas classified as sustainable investments. Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania are among the countries that want to attract more investment for nuclear power as they move away from fossil fuels. Germany, on the other side, along with Austria, Luxembourg, Portugal and Denmark have expressed concerns about a buildup of nuclear power plants and the radioactive waste they produce. “Different visions of low-carbon transition made it up to the political agenda,” said Alexander Lehmann, head of the Sustainable World Academy at Frankfurt School of Finance and Management. “The costs of the transition begin to sink in on people, so diametrically opposed energy policies have become clearer,” he said. “It has brought key oppositions out in the open.” Including nuclear and gas energy in Europe’s sustainable investment rule book — known as a green taxonomy — could have significant implications at home and abroad. In Europe, it would unlock billions of euros in state aid for expensive nuclear energy projects. Banks and pension managers offering investments supporting environmental, social and governance causes — known as ESG funds — would find it easier to include nuclear energy companies and natural gas in sustainable investment funds that they offer to or invest in for clients. “By and large, nuclear was not considered to be ESG-friendly,” said Marisa Drew, the head of sustainable investing at Credit Suisse. E.U. approval, however, would open up “a potentially big wave of investment dollars,” she said. “Trillions of ESG money could find its way in this direction,” she added. Sandrine Dixson-Declève, a co-president of the Club of Rome and a member of the panel that advised the European Commission on nuclear and natural gas, said that neither power source could be considered green. The advisory body, known as the European Commission Advisory Platform on Sustainable Finance, concluded earlier this year that nuclear power plants posed risks of “significant harm” to the environment because of the radioactive waste they generate and concerns over the safety of storing it, she said. “We couldn’t give it a clean bill of health,” she said. Tsvetelina Kuzmanova, an expert on sustainable finance and a policy adviser at E3G, a Brussels think tank, said including nuclear and natural gas in the taxonomy amounted to “calling something that isn’t green, green.” She said a number of other countries are likely to be influenced by the European Union’s final ruling, and warned that it could create “a race to the bottom.”  Further debate means it could take years before the E.U.’s rule book actually comes into force.  Nonetheless, the political tide has increasingly turned in favor of nuclear power as a low-carbon solution to mitigate climate change — especially a new generation of smaller, cheaper plants across the globe, said George Borovas, head of nuclear practice at the global law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth. “There will be a nuclear renaissance,” he said. “It’s not going to be for everyone, but it will be for a number of countries.” Investment money wouldn’t start flowing right away, noted Ms. Drew of Credit Suisse. Banks will need to update their sustainable investment governance for funds offered to clients, to include nuclear and gas alongside renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. And small modular nuclear reactor projects, in particular, still need to get off the ground. “It’s early days. You have a few people with business plans looking for funding,” she noted. But as the industry scales up, so will the investments. A number of companies, from Rolls-Royce to Westinghouse, are working on models that can be put together in factories and assembled on site at the fraction of the cost of traditional behemoth nuclear plants. “That’s a massively different economic proposition,” Ms. Drew said, adding that investors were looking at small nuclear plants as a potential power source for factories, desalination facilities or even cryptocurrency miners. If that happens, she said, “we’re not going to get that genie back in the box.”"

Just days earlier, another independent online media outlet, Stand News, closed after hundreds of police raided its offices and arrested seven people. Two former senior editors at Stand News and the publication itself were charged with conspiracy to publish seditious materials. The latest closures are the final chapters in the demise of independent media in Hong Kong, a city that once had some of the freest and most aggressive news media in Asia. Now, as Beijing continues a sweeping crackdown on the city, the journalists who once covered the city’s protests and politics are increasingly either under arrest or out of work, without anywhere to publish. “What’s happening is not just another closure of a media outlet,” said Lokman Tsui, a former journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “This is part of a larger project by the government of dismantling all critical media, of all independent media in Hong Kong.” Stand News and Citizen News were part of a flourishing media scene that arose covering pro-democracy protest movements in Hong Kong. They carried few advertisements, instead relying on donations. They were built for online readers, often livestreaming protests for hours on end. When the protest movement was stamped out by widespread arrests and a sweeping security law, they turned their focus to the courts, documenting dozens of criminal cases against protesters and opposition politicians. Citizen News was founded five years ago by a handful of editors and reporters with long experience at other news outlets in Hong Kong. The company’s small size sometimes meant they couldn’t match the comprehensiveness of larger publications. But they dug into local issues, often delivering scoops on how the authorities were pressing their legal campaign against the opposition. In September they were the first to report that prosecutors planned to argue that a group that held annual vigils to mourn the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown was subversive because of its slogan, “End one-party dictatorship.” As journalists continued to be arrested, Citizen News’ executives said they realized that publishing such work might no longer be safe. “We haven’t changed,” Daisy Li, the chief editor of Citizen News, told reporters on Monday. “It’s the exterior, objective environment that has changed. As the chief editor, I’m not able to decide whether this story, that reporting or this quote, if published, will violate the law in this changed environment.” The newer digital outlets drew inspiration and staff from Apple Daily, the aggressively independent newspaper founded in 1995 by the tycoon Jimmy Lai. Mr. Lai was vociferously anti-communist and promoted a freewheeling style of tabloid journalism, as aggressive in covering government malfeasance as it was in chasing celebrity gossip. Mr. Lai was long a thorn in Beijing’s side. But after he and several Apple Daily executives were arrested and the publication was forced to close last year, the authorities’ attention turned toward smaller independent outlets like Stand News and Citizen News. While they avoided the tabloid sensibilities of Apple Daily, they were equally focused on scrutinizing the government and giving voice to opposition figures, angering the authorities. “They were super-professional in their news analysis, super-rigorous in their fact-checking and also, this is the important part, they were not afraid to speak truth to power,” Mr. Tsui said. “That’s what’s doing them in right now.” Weeks before the raid on Stand News, Hong Kong’s security secretary, Chris Tang, accused the outlet of “biased, smearing and demonizing” reporting on conditions in the city’s prisons. As independent outlets have shuttered, traditional news media has grown increasingly cautious. Radio Television Hong Kong, or RTHK, a public broadcaster long considered one of Hong Kong’s most reliable news providers, has been remolded by the government into something that critics say more closely resembles Chinese state media, hewing closely to official pronouncements and staid recounting of government activities. When Peng Shuai, the Chinese tennis star, accused a former senior Communist Party official of sexual assault last year, she set off the sort of political scandal that traditionally would have dominated Hong Kong media. But mainstream outlets initially ignored the development. RTHK’s website carried a single story from a month after the allegations first emerged that simply refers to the Women’s Tennis Association’s concerns about her safety, without detailing Ms. Peng’s allegations. Ming Pao, a centrist Chinese-language newspaper, at first carried the news only in its business pages. That article examined the effect on companies connected to the official, Zhang Gaoli, who was formerly a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the top echelon of political power in China. Ming Pao’s chief editor, reached by phone, declined to comment on the coverage. “Peng Shuai is the latest example where you can tell who is not afraid to speak truth to power and who is,” Mr. Tsui said. “That is really revealing to me that none of the main outlets were willing to put it on their cover or even discuss it.” The silencing of independent news outlets has helped expand the influence of Beijing’s own publications. State-controlled newspapers Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao have frequently used their pages to attack pro-democracy politicians, journalists and activists. Opposition politicians have said journalists from those newspapers sometimes tail them for days. Their pages are closely monitored for clues as to what the security services might do next. When their attacks intensify, official actions often follow. Last year, Ta Kung Pao published a series of articles attacking Stand News and accusing it of supporting terrorism for a piece that compared violent resistance campaigns in Northern Ireland and Hong Kong. The arrests of journalists and closings of independent outlets have received widespread criticism from media freedom organizations and Western governments. After the raid on Stand News, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken urged the Hong Kong and Chinese central governments to release detained journalists and media executives. “Journalism is not sedition,” he said. Beijing has accused its critics in the West of seeking to destabilize Hong Kong. “These people have willfully misrepresented the lawful actions taken by the Hong Kong Police Force, vainly attempting to use press freedom as a shield for criminal acts and hamper the rule of law in Hong Kong through the straw-man trick,” the People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s flagship newspaper, said in an editorial. In a letter to The Wall Street Journal, Hong Kong’s chief secretary, John Lee, has said that instead of criticizing the crackdown in editorials, the newspaper should support the arrests. “If you are genuinely interested in press freedom, you should support actions against people who have unlawfully exploited the media as a tool to pursue their political or personal gains,” he wrote."

High-risk patients carrying the Delta variant could benefit greatly from two particular monoclonal antibody treatments shown to reduce hospitalization and death. But those medications would most likely do nothing for patients with Omicron, who would only respond to a third antibody treatment that is in very short supply. While U.S. officials have endorsed using a workaround test that can identify Omicron’s genetic signature, experts say it’s not feasible for large health systems facing a crush of patients to employ in each case. That makes treating patients challenging in places like Maryland, where cases are spiking and Omicron accounts for roughly 58 percent of them. The Delta variant is also holding strong in the Great Plains and swaths of the West, including California. While there is no approved test to determine each individual’s variant, a national network of state and other labs use genome-sequencing tests to track variants broadly in communities. Health systems then use those regional estimates or their own data to decide which antibody treatments to use in their clinics and hospitals. Many of them concluded that a community of largely Delta patients would benefit most from the antibody drugs made by Regeneron and Eli Lilly, while communities where Omicron patients are predominant would benefit from antibodies from GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology. Federal officials have dabbled with making the decision for the nation. On Dec. 23, they stopped shipments of antibody treatments by Eli Lilly and Regeneron after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 73 percent of U.S. Covid cases were Omicron. An outcry followed from Republican political leaders, who argued that some people in their states were still infected with Delta. And on Tuesday, the C.D.C. slashed its estimate of national Omicron cases to 59 percent. On Dec. 31, federal officials resumed national shipping all of the antibody treatments. For the next few weeks, as the country grapples with this uneven mix of both variants, tailoring treatments to each patient will be “extraordinarily difficult,” said Dr. Alex Greninger, assistant director of the clinical virology laboratories at the University of Washington Medical Center. Dr. Greninger is credited with developing one of the first tests to detect the coronavirus in the United States. But he is pessimistic that health systems can pivot quickly to sort out which patients have Delta or Omicron. And although a shortcut test can detect Omicron, there’s no simple way to report the results in bulk, he said. What’s more, the genome sequencing used by public health officials takes nearly a week — too long to target the early antibody treatments that have been found to reduce the need for hospitalizations. That makes patient care particularly difficult right now, said Dr. Mark Siedner, an infectious disease clinician and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital. In Massachusetts and nearby states, an estimated 44.5 percent of cases are Omicron. Dr. Siedner said his health system has stopped using the Regeneron and Eli Lilly antibodies that are not effective against Omicron and are “anxiously awaiting” more doses of the effective treatment by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology. “We’re in a holding pattern and it’s a terrible time to be in that place,” he said. Officials across the United States, from President Biden on down, have been insisting that they are no longer in the shutdown business, and will not order any closures to contain the latest surge in coronavirus cases. But Omicron may be taking the decision out of their hands. So many workers are testing positive or calling in sick that businesses, schools, government agencies and more are being crippled by staff shortages that may force them to close some operations anyway. Airlines began canceling flights in large numbers on Christmas Eve for lack of crews, and the problems have continued into the new year. Broadway shows have been canceled because of outbreaks backstage. Major companies have delayed or entirely jettisoned return-to-office plans. Many colleges are switching back to virtual classes to start the semester. And public school leaders are struggling to respond to a situation that has changed greatly from when students went on holiday breaks before Christmas, barely a week ago. Four large city school systems — Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Newark — have joined a growing list of public schools around the country that put off reopening on Monday, switched to remote instruction, or both. Covid-19 outbreaks and staffing shortages forced their hands. Omicron has driven case numbers to staggering new heights: The United States is averaging more than 484,600 daily cases over the past week, a 238 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are up 41 percent in the past two weeks, while deaths are down by 3 percent. In some cases, the very resources needed to cope with Omicron’s staffing disruptions are themselves being disrupted, from the call-center agents who rebook canceled flights to the frontline medical professionals who care for sick workers. Infected police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and transit workers are leaving shifts unfilled. In New York City, subway lines have been delayed by staff shortages, and the Fire Department has asked residents not to call 911 except in a real emergency. Many elected leaders of both parties have discarded their sharpest pandemic-curbing tools, like closing government offices, schools and businesses, which have come with staggering economic, social and political costs. Instead, elected officials have stressed the importance of vaccination, booster shots and mask-wearing. “I am not prepared to shut down schools or the economy at this time,” Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York, a Democrat, said before New York suffered a string of new daily case records last week. “I will not overreact and send this economy spiraling out of control once again.” Many leading public health experts aren’t seeking shutdowns, either. If anything, many appear to be taking an opposite tack. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced new guidelines to help schools stay open, by allowing children who are exposed to the coronavirus to “test to stay” instead of automatically having to quarantine at home. And it has said that some Americans who test positive can leave isolation after five days, half as long as previous recommendations. A federal judge granted a preliminary injunction on Monday blocking the Department of Defense from taking “any adverse action” against 35 Navy sailors who have refused to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, arguing that it violated their religious freedoms. The service members — including Navy SEALs and members of the Naval Special Warfare Command — had filed suit against the Biden administration arguing that their “sincerely held religious beliefs forbid each of them from receiving the Covid-19 vaccine for a variety of reasons based upon their Christian faith.” The Pentagon had mandated that all active-duty troops receive the vaccine. The judge, Reed O’Connor of the Northern District of Texas, effectively blocked the department from punishing those troops. “Our nation asks the men and women in our military to serve, suffer, and sacrifice. But we do not ask them to lay aside their citizenry and give up the very rights they have sworn to protect,” Judge O’Connor wrote in his 26-page order. He added: “The Covid-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no Covid-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.” The group represents a small fraction of active-duty troops from the United States, and as of mid-December, most active-duty soldiers and members of the Navy had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Thousands have requested religious exemptions, and none have been granted so far, officials said in December. The decision follows another injunction by a judge in November against President Biden’s national vaccine mandate for health care workers. Judge O’Connor, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, has reliably tossed several Democratic policies that have been challenged on the federal bench. In response to the injunction on Monday, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, wrote on Twitter, “This is a major win!” A spokesperson for the Pentagon could not immediately be reached for comment. But on Monday evening, John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said that defense officials were reviewing the injunction, according to The Washington Post. The coronavirus is spreading faster than ever at the start of 2022, but the last days of 2021 brought some encouraging news about the latest wave of infections. With growing evidence that the Omicron variant produces less severe illness than in earlier waves, governments are redoubling their focus on vaccinations and boosters, which are increasingly seen as the world’s ticket to “living with Covid.” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert, said on Sunday that hospitalizations, which are not rising as fast, were a more important barometer than reported cases for the severity of the Omicron wave, a sharp distinction after nearly two years of tallying daily case counts. “As you get further on and the infections become less severe, it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations as opposed to the total number of cases,” Dr. Fauci said. Still, the case numbers remain staggering. The world is recording an average of nearly 1.5 million new cases every day, twice as many per day as were recorded nearly a week ago, although the figures in many places may have been distorted by holiday reporting delays. In the United States, experts forecast that the Omicron wave could crest in mid-January, but not before millions were infected every week. Across Europe, caseloads have soared to new highs and ushered in another bitter winter of social restrictions, mask mandates and shifting travel rules. The holidays made things worse as colder weather and festive gatherings drove people indoors, where the virus circulates more easily. Airports and mass transit hubs were snarled with travelers after many people stayed home last year. And with many government offices closed, testing and case data were not being compiled as regularly, leaving officials and experts, at least temporarily, with an incomplete picture of how bad things were getting. As much of the world returns to work this week, however, several trends are becoming clearer: Although many governments are loath to lock down again, officials are tweaking rules to account for Omicron’s blazing spread. Paris last week became the latest European city to reimpose an outdoor mask mandate. South Korea joined France and others in setting an expiry date for its vaccine passes, hoping to push more people to get boosters. Here are some other trends to watch for: Mayor Eric Adams insisted on Monday morning that New York City’s schools would stay open despite an extraordinary surge in Omicron cases. But about a third of city parents did not send their children back to classrooms on the first day after the holiday break. Attendance was just over 67 percent, slightly higher than the low point of 65 percent the system reached on the day before winter break. Throughout the day on Monday, Adams was adamant that the system would remain open. He repeated the message in a series of television interviews and after his first official school visit since taking office on New Year’s Day. “We’re really excited about the opening of our schools,” Mr. Adams said outside the school, Concourse Village Elementary School in the Bronx. “We want to be extremely clear: the safest place for our children is a school building.” Mr. Adams said that remote learning had been disastrous for too many of the city’s nearly one million schoolchildren in the nation’s largest school district, and had been particularly harmful for children in low-income neighborhoods and homeless students. But the calm that Mr. Adams sought to project was not shared by the many parents and educators who greeted Monday morning with profound trepidation. After roughly a year of remarkably low virus transmission in schools, Covid cases soared in the week before the winter break, prompting the closures of 11 schools and over 400 classrooms, and the contact tracing system for city schools effectively collapsed amid the surge. New York City reported 35,650 new virus cases on Sunday, with a 7-day average test positivity rate of nearly 22 percent, according to state data. Some families and elected officials have called on Mr. Adams to delay the start of school by a few days to allow every child and educator to get tested. And teachers have raised questions about how schools will be properly staffed with so many teachers sick with the virus or quarantining due to exposures. “This is an all hands on deck moment,” Mr. Adams said, acknowledging that administrators who are not normally in the classroom would be used to address staff shortages if necessary. Mr. Adams has endorsed a plan created by former Mayor Bill de Blasio that is designed to keep more classrooms open as the surge continues. The plan calls for distributing 1.5 million rapid at-home test kits to schools. Starting Monday, the city is also doubling its random in-school testing program to give P.C.R. tests to 20 percent of consenting children in each school weekly. But most families have not opted in to allow their children to be tested, which has made the testing pool very small at some schools. The mayor and the new schools chancellor, David C. Banks, are betting that their plan to increase testing will prevent major outbreaks. “We’re going to turn those question marks into an exclamation point: we’re staying open,” Mr. Adams said. Mr. Adams and Mr. Banks have so far resisted calls to mandate booster shots for educators or vaccines for children. The mayor has said a decision will be made this spring about mandating vaccines for students for the fall. “We’re not at the point of mandate,” Mr. Adams said Monday, as he encouraged eligible New Yorkers to get vaccinated and boosted. Michael Mulgrew, president of the city’s teachers’ union, said in an email to members that he had encouraged Mr. Adams to start the year remotely. But on Monday morning, Mr. Mulgrew said he was working closely with the new mayor and that schools had been some of the safest places in the city throughout the pandemic. Later on Monday, Gov. Kathy Hochul reiterated her commitment to keeping New York’s children in schools. “My view is that every child should be back in school unless they are testing positive,” she said. The state has distributed 5.2 million at-home test kits to schools thus far, and another 3.8 million arrived yesterday and have yet to be distributed. Under the current rule, test kits will only be provided to students for known exposures that occur in classrooms, although Ms. Hochul said that policy was under review. She also cautioned against a return to remote learning. “The teachers did the best they could. The parents did the best they could,” she said. “But we ask too much.” In particular, she spoke about the effects of remote learning on children in communities of color, those who lacked resources and those without high-speed internet access — an existing digital divide that she said had widened into a “digital canyon.” “We cannot have that,” Ms. Hochul said. “That was an injustice. We cannot have that anymore.” SACRAMENTO — With the Omicron variant raging across California, millions of schoolchildren returned to classrooms on Monday, ending the holiday break as many had spent it — masked, distanced, apprehensive and in long lines with their parents, scrambling for coronavirus tests. Few schools were closed in a state whose Covid-19 precautions have been among the most aggressive in the nation. California has managed to maintain comparatively low rates of virus-related deaths and hospitalizations. But infections have soared recently because of the highly contagious variant, which appears to result in less severe cases. In hundreds of districts, in-person instruction was conditioned on heightened health requirements and fraught with the understanding that even those might not prevent a return to remote learning. “Frankly, the disruption I’m worried about isn’t Day 1 — it’s Day 2, 3 or 4 if we get 30 or 40 or 50 positive cases,” said Alex Cherniss, the superintendent of the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, where, after days of impassioned community debate, some 10,000 students in coastal Los Angeles County returned to class on Monday. “People are exhausted here,” he said. California’s largest school district, Los Angeles Unified, was not scheduled to resume classes until next week. But on Monday, the district issued new rules requiring baseline testing as a condition of returning to campus, regardless of vaccination status. Previously, testing had been optional for vaccinated and asymptomatic students and employees. In many other districts, reopening classrooms on Monday also hinged on fresh rounds of coronavirus testing. In Marin County, students had been given kits to test for the virus before re-entering campus. In Sacramento County, families stood for hours over the weekend at testing sites hastily erected by school districts or took advantage of an infusion of six million take-home tests the state supplied to districts across California as Omicron was starting to spike. “We did two tests at home and he’s fine,” Emily Ramey said as she dropped off her younger child at a middle school in suburban Sacramento. “I’m just hoping that everyone else tested, too.” Los Angeles Unified already conducts the nation’s largest weekly school-based coronavirus testing program, but health officials in the county have ratcheted up other measures that will affect the hundreds of thousands of students and employees in the school system, along with those in private schools and nearly 80 other public school districts. New health rules starting Jan. 1 mandate, for example, that returning students at all of the county’s districts wear face masks not only indoors but also outside at recess, and that school employees upgrade to medical-grade N95 or KN95 face coverings. Gov. Gavin Newsom has reiterated that the state is “committed” to keeping classrooms open and promised last month to make home testing kits “available to every K-12 public school student as they head back to the classroom from winter break.” But not all districts had received their allotment by Monday. San Francisco schools increased mobile testing sites throughout the city and strongly encouraged students to get tested before returning, in part because they will not receive their allotment of tests from the state until later this week. In Palos Verdes, Mr. Cherniss said concern over Omicron almost prompted the district to delay reopening until next week. But when he announced he was considering it, he said, the outcry from parents was fierce. Eventually, the district opted to reopen as scheduled, but to strongly encourage students to test before returning. “We did a big push over the weekend,” he said. “We handed out 2,000 home tests in less than three hours and did another 2,000 live tests. More than 100 were positive.” The top medical official at the U.S. Capitol urged lawmakers and their staff members on Monday to work remotely and take additional precautions against the coronavirus, after the seven-day positivity rate at the building’s on-site coronavirus test center rose rapidly from less than 1 percent to more than 13 percent. In a letter to congressional offices obtained by The New York Times, Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician, informed lawmakers that there had been an “unprecedented number of cases” among hundreds of people who work in the Capitol complex, with dozens testing positive daily. Of the cases detected, 65 percent were symptomatic, the letter said. As of Dec. 15, a majority of the infections were breakthrough cases, with 61 percent caused by the Omicron variant and 38 percent caused by the Delta variant. The building offers daily testing for lawmakers, their staffs, Capitol workers and journalists who work in the building, and lawmakers were among the first wave of eligible people to receive vaccinations and boosters in the country. The breakthrough infections, Dr. Monahan said, had not led to any hospitalizations, serious complications or deaths. “I urge all individuals also to continue essential measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus,” Dr. Monahan wrote in his letter, encouraging lawmakers to maximize the amount of remote work done in their offices and advising all people in the building to use medical-grade masks. With the Senate set to hold votes on Tuesday, Democrats have now decided to meet virtually for their weekly caucus lunch, according to a senior aide. The House is not set to return until Jan. 10. Dr. Monahan has little authority to enforce his guidance, in an institution where individual congressional offices can set their own policies and guidelines. Mask-wearing in recent months has largely been divided along party lines, with two Republicans, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Andrew Clyde, incurring more than $100,000 combined in fines for flouting the mask mandate on the House floor. The Food and Drug Administration on Monday authorized booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds, a group that became eligible for initial shots in May. Regulators also shortened by a month the amount of time that adult and adolescent recipients of Pfizer’s vaccine should wait between their second and third doses, allowing them to seek booster shots five months after their second injections.  And they allowed some children aged 5 to 11 with immune deficiencies to seek a third shot, including those who have undergone solid organ transplants or have conditions that amount to “an equivalent level of immunocompromise,” the agency said in a statement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee is set to meet Wednesday to review the F.D.A. moves and decide whether to recommend the changes. If it does, the C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, is expected to quickly sign off on them.   The F.D.A. said that it examined data from Israel on more than 6,300 people in the 12- to 15-year-old age group who received booster shots at least five months after a second dose. That data “enabled the F.D.A. to reassess the benefits and risks of the use of a booster in the younger adolescent population in the setting of the current surge in Covid-19 cases,” the agency said. The review showed no new safety concerns, including no new cases of myocarditis, a rare heart-related side effect that has been tied to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, particularly in younger men. The condition involves inflammation of the heart muscle. Dr. Peter Marks, who oversees the agency’s division that regulates vaccines, said that the risk of myocarditis was substantially lower after a booster dose than after a second dose, citing U.S. safety monitoring data. The benefits of a third shot outweighed the potential risks, he said, because it may better protect individuals against both the Delta and Omicron variants. Regulators also relied on Israeli data in shortening the interval between second and third doses of the Pfizer vaccine. No new safety issues have emerged in the United States among more than four million people 16 and older who got a third dose at least five months after a second, the F.D.A. said.  Because studies have shown that a Pfizer booster dose increases protection against the Omicron variant, a shorter interval might offer “better protection sooner,” the agency said. Other studies have shown that the potency of two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine ebbs over time.  “We do know that waning has occurred by five months,” Dr. Janet Woodcock, the F.D.A.’s acting commissioner said at a Monday morning news conference at which she and Dr. Marks gave updates on their deliberations about whether to further expand authorizations for Covid vaccines. The F.D.A. has not received sufficient dataon the benefits of a booster shot of Moderna’s vaccine at five months, and so is sticking to the six-month interval for that vaccine. “We will obviously be receptive to data that are submitted to us from Moderna and we’ll take action on those data with all due speed,” Dr. Marks said. He declined to say whether authorization of a third shot was in the offing for those who received one dose of Johnson & Johnson and a second dose of either Pfizer or Moderna’s vaccine. He said the combination appears “to give a very good immune response,” but that more data is needed over time. Asked about booster shots for 5- to 11- year olds, Dr. Marks said that only about a quarter of them have been vaccinated, mostly in the last two months. “It would be great to get a larger percentage of those kids vaccinated, and then we’ll see how many months afterward we need to get them boosted,” he said. No vaccine is yet authorized for children under five. “We certainly understand that there is a pressing need in that age range,” Dr. Marks said, promising that the F.D.A. “will move with appropriate speed with the appropriate data in hand.” Hospitalizations for the coronavirus are rising steeply in New York State, approaching the peak of last winter’s surge and driving the number of deaths reported in a single day above 100 for the first time since last March, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday. Hospitalizations have now surpassed last winter’s peak in New York City, the governor said. She added that there were some signs that this wave of hospitalizations may not be as severe as past surges, but she said the rapid rise was still “a trend that is troubling.” “We’re not in a good place, I’m going to be really honest with you,” Ms. Hochul said at a news briefing in Rochester, as she announced additional testing sites and the arrival of millions of rapid tests to help schools stay open through the virus spike.  Hospitalizations are being closely watched in New York City, one of the first places to be hit hard by the Omicron variant, as a bellwether for the nation as a whole. Omicron was first reported in New York City a month ago, and led to an enormous surge in new cases, from less than 2,500 per day to nearly 50,000 per day on New Year’s Eve. But in the past 10 days, hospitalizations have started to rise even more steeply than cases in New York City, leaping 130 percent between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve, compared to a 60 percent rise in cases over the same period, state data shows. As of Sunday, more than 4,500 people were hospitalized in the city, 500 of them in intensive care units. Statewide, nearly 9,000 people were hospitalized, and 103 people were reported to have died on Sunday. The number of Covid patients in New York City intensive care units is still lower than the peak of last winter’s surge, before vaccines were widely available, when about 750 people were in intensive care. And hospitalizations remain much lower than when Covid-19 first swept the city in spring 2020 and 12,000 people were hospitalized on the worst days, 3,000 of them in intensive care. Unvaccinated people are far more likely to be hospitalized with Covid-19 than vaccinated people, state data shows. In the week ending Dec. 20, the rate of unvaccinated people hospitalized for Covid statewide was 30 per 100,000, compared to a rate of 2 per 100,000 for the fully vaccinated. The hospitalizations are threatening to wear down a health care system whose ranks are already thinned by infections and attrition during the pandemic, and hospitals are readying emergency staffing plans. More than 20 hospitals across the state have been ordered to stop elective surgeries because they lack the capacity to perform them. But Ms. Hochul said that some hospital executives have told her between 20 and 50 percent of their Covid patients are not suffering from severe symptoms, but that they are testing positive in the hospital incidentally, after being admitted for other reasons such as car accidents. As a result, beginning Tuesday, the state will begin to ask hospitals to break down how many patients are being admitted for acute Covid-19 symptoms, in an effort to further decipher this wave’s severity. “I just want to always want to be honest with New Yorkers about how bad this is,” Ms. Hochul said. “Yes, the sheer numbers of people infected are high, but I want to see if hospitalizations are correlated to that.” With schools open in New York City and much of the state on Monday, and masks still optional in certain fully vaccinated settings, some are calling on the city and state to do more to slow the hospitalizations down. Mark Levine, the Manhattan borough president, called on policymakers to immediately urge people to work from home and avoid large gatherings for the next two weeks, as part of a 16-point plan he released Monday. “Hospitalizations in NYC are rising faster than at any point since March 2020,” he wrote on Twitter. “We can’t just accept this. We have to do more to slow this wave.” The Omicron surge has prompted sharp new limits on the number of journalists allowed to attend White House news briefings. The board of the White House Correspondents Association voted on Sunday to limit attendance to 14 reporters, sitting spaced apart in a room with 49 chairs. Three major news agencies will always be represented, two spots are earmarked for major U.S. television networks, and there will be one pool reporter each for print, radio, TV and foreign outlets. The remaining five seats will be rotated on various schedules among 48 news organizations, including The New York Times. The president of the association, Steve Portnoy of CBS Radio, wrote in an email to members, “Given the virulence of the spread, medical experts have once again advised that it would be prudent to substantially reduce the number of people working in the cramped, poorly ventilated work space that we share.” He said that standing in the briefing room’s aisles, a common practice for reporters without assigned seats, “is not welcome at this time” because photographers need room to maintain social distance as they work. The association is also urging its members to stay away from the White House when not on a specific assignment, to minimize the chances of “an outbreak that might limit our ability to cover the president in close quarters,” Mr. Portnoy wrote. “I promise this won’t last a day longer than necessary,” he said in the email, adding that the board would revisit the situation by Jan. 21. As hospitals already strained by the Delta variant threaten to buckle under a crush of patients infected with the even more contagious Omicron, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci said Americans should focus more on the threat the winter wave poses to hospitals and less on the record number of cases. Over the past week, an average of more than 401,200 cases has been reported each day in the United States, tripling from two weeks ago and the first time the number has topped 400,000, according to a New York Times database (new case numbers are slightly depressed because fewer states are reporting after the New Year holiday). Hospitalizations were by comparison up 33 percent, however, to 92,300, while deaths had dropped 4 percent to an average of 1,249 daily. It’s unclear how many hospitalizations are patients infected with Omicron rather than the Delta variant, which scientists believe is significantly more virulent. According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the week ending Dec. 25, Omicron accounted for over 58 percent of new cases versus over 41 percent for Delta. Dr. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, noted on Sunday on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos” that many new infections, especially in people who are vaccinated and boosted, result in no symptoms or mild symptoms, making the absolute number of cases less important than it was for previous versions of the virus. “As you get further on and the infections become less severe, it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations as opposed to the total number of cases,” Dr. Fauci said. That advice is in keeping with what many epidemiologists have said all along. Despite the daily drumbeat of case counts, the number of positive tests has never been a perfect indicator of the course of the epidemic. The number of cases has exploded because the Omicron variant seems to be much more contagious and able to evade vaccines than other earlier variants, which has spurred more widespread testing. What’s more, the official numbers are almost certainly an undercount, because many people are testing positive on rapid at-home tests or carrying the virus without any symptoms. Yet, as Dr. Fauci told Mr. Stephanopoulos, the concern is not so much the mild or asymptomatic Omicron cases as it is the number of people with severe or fatal infections. “The real bottom line that you want to be concerned about,” he said, “is are we getting protected by the vaccines from severe disease leading to hospitalization?” So far, vaccines and boosters appear to be providing that protection. But the unvaccinated remain at risk. “I’m still very concerned about the tens of millions of people who are not vaccinated at all because even though many of them are going to get asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, a fair number of them are going to get severe disease,” Dr. Fauci said. The Louisiana Department of Health tweeted on Sunday that hospitalizations in the state have topped 1,000, and that 76 percent of those hospitalized “are not up to date” on their vaccination status. Also, even if Omicron is milder, as most evidence suggests, a higher caseload means more health care workers who cannot work because they test positive as well as more chances that people could get sick enough to require medical care. “We have got to be careful about that, because, even if you have a less of a percentage of severity, when you have multi-multi-multi-fold more people getting infected, the net amount is you’re still going to get a lot of people that are going to be needing hospitalization,” Dr. Fauci said.  Hospitals in several states are showing signs of strain and experiencing staffing shortages. “At the moment, the major concern is the effect of Omicron on hospital staffing in conjunction with fatigue and increasing admissions for Covid-19 as well as other things,” said Julio Figueroa, chief of infectious diseases at the Louisiana State School Health Sciences Center.  Hawaii has requested 700 additional health care workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, while some hospitals in the St. Louis area have started to limit visitors again. Leaders in Illinois have urged hospitals to postpone elective surgeries and procedures. The Maryland Hospital Association said that the number of hospital patients had surpassed the state’s Covid peak from last winter. “We believe that the next four to six weeks are really going to be a terrible point in this crisis, and it’s potentially going to be the worst part of the whole two-year fight,” Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland said on the CNN program “State of the Union.” Large city school systems in Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee and Newark have joined a growing list of public schools across the country that have postponed reopening after the holiday break, switched to remote instruction, or have taken both steps because of Covid-19 outbreaks and staffing shortages. Some of the announcements came abruptly, as school leaders struggled to respond to a rapidly changing situation. Some school systems that are open for in-person instruction this week have nonetheless had to shut some school buildings for lack of staff, including eight schools in Columbus, Ohio, and 12 in Pittsburgh. An increasing number of people with compromised immune systems in the U.S. are sidestepping government guidelines to receive unauthorized fourth or fifth shots. The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are in charge of determining when additional doses should be administered, but some patients and their doctors feel that federal agencies have acted too slowly to protect the most vulnerable. Israel has already begun officially offering fourth shots — Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announced on Sunday that the country would offer additional shots to people age 60 and over, as well as to medical workers, becoming the first country to start administering an additional booster so broadly. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidelines in late October to say that immunocompromised people would be eligible for a fourth dose six months after a third. For those who followed the rules, the earliest eligibility for a fourth would be in late February. But as new variants like Omicron arise and vaccination rates continue to be sluggish in many areas, worrying those with weak immune systems, many of them are getting extra shots without being certain of whether they are safe or effective. All secondary school students in England must be tested for the coronavirus before returning to classrooms after the holidays, the British government announced on Monday, in the latest measure aimed at controlling a rise in infections driven by the Omicron variant. Schools have been provided with rapid test kits to administer on site when pupils begin returning to classes this week, officials said, adding that students should continue to test themselves at least twice a week. Older students, including those at universities, had already been advised to test themselves at home before returning to campuses. “We are doing all we can to minimize disruption this virus causes to everyday life, including keeping children in school, and regular testing is a key way to support schools and protect face-to-face teaching,” Britain’s health minister, Sajid Javid, said in a statement. Self-administered rapid antigen tests — known in Britain as lateral-flow tests — have become a ubiquitous part of British life over the past year, provided free by the government through the mail and at pharmacies. Over the holidays, however, supply difficulties and surging demand have often made them more difficult to obtain, with officials blaming a “worldwide shortage.” Officials said on Monday that schools would have access to “a separate supply route” to order additional tests. The government also said that English secondary school students, though not their teachers, would be required to wear masks in classrooms until at least Jan. 26. Masks are already recommended for students in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, where separate devolved governments decide on their own Covid measures.  While those governments reintroduced restrictions on gatherings after Christmas, Mr. Javid and other British officials have said that further restrictions on everyday life in England are not necessary because cases of severe illness are not rising as fast as in previous waves.  Even as Britain recorded its all-time highs in daily cases last week, the health secretary said that the country has “some of the least restrictive measures in Europe,” and argued that high vaccination rates, including a scaled-up booster program, would allow Britons to live with the virus. “Curbs on our freedom must be an absolute last resort and the British people rightly expect us to do everything in our power to avert them,” Mr. Javid wrote in The Daily Mail newspaper on Friday. Data released by British health officials last week added to findings that Omicron might produce less severe illness than previous variants. Still, some experts warned that the sheer number of cases would strain Britain’s health system. Government data showed a 50 percent rise in both hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19 over the past week, with nearly 1,000 people having died within 28 days of a positive test. As of Monday, South Korea’s vaccine passes will have a six-month expiration date, as the health authorities seek to manage the country’s “living with Covid” strategy. Under the vaccine pass system, which started in mid-December, visitors to public places like restaurants, cafes, sports facilities and movie theaters must present proof of vaccination to gain access. (Proof of a recent negative P.C.R. test is also accepted.) With the tightened rules, those who received two doses of the coronavirus vaccine must get a booster shot within six months, or their vaccine passes — issued 14 days after getting a second dose — will be void. (Negative test results issued within 48 hours will still be accepted.) Fines or administrative action against violators will begin starting on Jan. 10, according to Yonhap News Agency. Both people who flout the rule and venues that fail to enforce it could face punishment. The vaccine pass system has spurred debate in South Korea over whether it is forcing people to take the vaccine. The country has fully vaccinated 83 percent of its population, according to Our World in Data, and on Monday Korean health officials reported 3,129 new daily cases of the virus. After weeks of record-breaking case counts, the country has had a 34 percent drop in daily cases over the past week. Other countries have also begun adding expiration dates to a primary vaccine regimen. Starting in February, the European Union Covid Certificate will have a validity period of nine months, and booster shots will be mandatory for travel across several countries on the continent. And beginning next week, the United Arab Emirates is set to bar people from leaving the country unless they have received three doses of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the state news agency WAM. Britain announced a goal to administer boosters to all adults by the end of the month, and Israel last week approved of a fourth shot for people with weak immune systems and others at high risk, including those 60 and over, and health care workers. The United States has been slower in its booster rollout, with only one-third of fully vaccinated adults receiving another shot as of mid-December. Chile will also offer its eligible residents a fourth coronavirus vaccine dose from February, President Sebastián Piñera announced. Health care workers, older people and those with chronic diseases would be given shots first. Vietnam has urged China, one of its major trading partners, to ease the measures local Chinese officials put in place at a key border crossing to fight the coronavirus, saying that the restrictions were leading to congestion and stranding thousands of trucks with goods. Earlier this month officials in Guangxi, an autonomous region in southern China, moved to curb rising coronavirus cases by enforcing more stringent border rules, such as extra checkpoints, mass testing and 24-hour security patrols, and suspending border gate operations and fruit imports. Those measures have disrupted supply chains in Vietnam, “adversely impacted the bilateral trade and caused great losses to businesses and people of both sides,” according to the state-run Vietnam News Agency. Vietnamese and Chinese trade officials held talks online and by phone to address the congestion late last month, V.N.A. reported. Vietnamese officials suggested “restoring customs clearance at the border gates and increasing the time for customs clearance,” the agency reported. Guangxi officials said they would ease customs clearance and convey other proposals to more senior officials, according to local news outlets. Fruit exports from Thailand to China — such as durians and longans — have also been held up by the tightened controls at Guangxi, Thai officials said in a statement on Sunday. After urgent talks with Thai officials, the Chinese authorities agreed to open another land checkpoint, the Pingxiang railway crossing in Guangxi, to allow Thai fruit into the country starting Tuesday, according to the Thai Office of Agricultural Affairs at Guangzhou. Drivers, cars and goods must be free of contamination or the Chinese authorities will immediately close the checkpoint again, Thai officials said. More than two million tons of Thai fruit worth $4.4 billion were exported to China from January to October 2021. As a surge of coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant takes a growing toll on live performance, the Public Theater announced recently that it would cancel its Under the Radar festival, originally scheduled to begin on Jan. 12. In a statement, the theater cited “multiple disruptions related to the rapid community spread of the Omicron variant,” including effects on staff availability, cancellations by artists and audience members, flight interruptions and visa processing delays. Mark Russell, the festival’s director, said in a video interview that his team had worked on plans to streamline Under the Radar — the Public’s annual showcase for experimental work, and one of several New York festivals that have formed around the Association of Performing Arts Professionals conference — so that it could proceed despite the surge. But on Thursday morning, Russell said, he took stock of the test positivity rate and number of cases in New York, and decided it would be irresponsible to press on. “It was not a time for a festival,” he said. “A festival is a celebration. It’s supposed to be a coming together to celebrate this work, and it was not going to be a celebration.” New York City is doubling the capacity of its free quarantine hotel program for people with the coronavirus, the agency that runs the program said Monday, after complaints from people who said their attempts to get a room through a city hotline met with endless waits on hold and delays of days for the rooms themselves. A spokesman for the city’s Test and Trace Corps, which runs the quarantine program, said in an email Monday, “We will have nearly a thousand beds available this week, and will continue to scale as needed.” The city has also been dealing with problems in a separate quarantine hotel program for people in homeless shelters after 11 women with the coronavirus were crammed into one room with just a few mattresses on the floor and some chairs. As the number of new virus cases in the city has skyrocketed, the spokesman, Adam Shrier, said that demand for the hotels had “quickly increased due to the rapidly transmissible Omicron variant.” He said that program had “several hundred beds available,” even as “our work force is suffering the same kind of illness and exposure as our other colleagues on the frontlines.” But he declined to say whether there was a wait for rooms, citing agency policy not to “disclose information about our locations or guests to protect their confidentiality.” Nearly 30,000 people have stayed in hotels since the program started in June 2020. The city calls it “the only free, major hotel isolation program in the country.” But four people who tried to take advantage of the main hotel-quarantine system told The New York Times late last week that they had either waited days before getting a room, given up and paid for one themselves, or been stuck on hold for hours on a city hotline without anyone ever picking up. Others posted on Twitter about long waits. Brittny Gaston of Brooklyn, 26, a medical assistant, said that five days after she requested a hotel room and was not given one, she finally spoke to someone, only to be told that she no longer qualified for the program because she no longer needed to quarantine, even though she still had Covid-19 symptoms and two people in her household had underlying health issues. “I really wanted to cry on the phone,” she said, adding that when she had Covid last February, she was able to get a quarantine hotel room without delay. Inside a homeless shelter in Brooklyn last week, meanwhile, 11 women who had tested positive for the virus were crowded into a small room, two of the women said.  One of the women, Anna Ortiz, who has chronic asthma, heart problems and uses a walker, said she had to sleep on an uncarpeted floor without a blanket or pillow. “I felt like I was being treated like an animal,” said Ms. Ortiz, 51. The city Department of Homeless Services described that situation as an “isolated incident” caused by the nonprofit that operates the shelter, Camba. Isaac McGinn, a spokesman for the Department of Homeless Services, said that Camba staff had not followed proper procedure and that the city had “conveyed to providers and staff the proper process for connecting clients who need it to isolation services to prevent this from happening.” He said that the system had abut 160 vacant beds in isolation units for people who are infected and another 210 beds in quarantine rooms for people who were exposed. A 54-year-old public-school science teacher on Long Island was arrested on New Year’s Eve after being accused of giving a teenager an injection of what appeared to be Covid-19 vaccine without his parents’ consent, the Nassau County police said. The police said that the teacher, Laura Parker Russo, administered a shot of what appeared to be a coronavirus vaccine to 17-year-old boy in her house in Sea Cliff, N.Y. The youth later went home and told his mother, who called the police and said she had not authorized the vaccination. Ms. Russo was charged with unauthorized practice of a profession, the police said. She has been removed from her classroom in the Herricks Public Schools system in New Hyde Park and reassigned pending the outcome of the investigation, schools officials said in a statement. A school website, which has been taken down, said Ms. Russo teaches at Herricks High School. Ms. Russo did not respond immediately to an email sent by The New York Times. She was released after her arrest and is scheduled to appear in criminal court on Jan. 21, the police said. Unauthorized practice of a profession is a felony under the state education law that carries a penalty of up to four years in prison. The majority of states, including New York, require parental consent for minors to receive Covid vaccinations. Some parents have prevented their children from getting inoculated for various reasons, including concerns about possible side effects and safety. Scientists say the vaccines are known to be safe for children 5 and older, and they urge vaccinating them because children can both spread the virus to others and become seriously ill themselves. The spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant has led to an increase in pediatric hospitalizations. And because broad immunity cannot be reached unless minors are vaccinated, federal and state officials hope that more parents will vaccinate their children, especially as many students return to school. Daily reports of new coronavirus cases have quadrupled in Nassau County over the past two weeks, according to The New York Times’s tracker. Hospitalizations in the county have risen 47 percent in that time. Seventy-six percent of Nassau County residents are vaccinated, according to The Times’s tracker, and the rate for 12- to 17-year-olds is only slightly lower, at 72 percent, according to state data. There is no statewide Covid vaccine mandate for schoolchildren in New York. But some private schools require vaccination, and New York City requires it for certain sports and extracurricular activities. In September, Los Angeles became the first school district to mandate vaccines for children 12 and older, with a deadline of Jan. 10, but those plans have since been delayed. The Washington, D.C., Council has voted to mandate vaccines for students 16 and older starting March 1. “This is a major source of tension between what is important for public health and what is important in terms of individual liberties and parental autonomy,” said Denis Nash, an epidemiologist at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. Schools require other vaccines for enrollment, like vaccination against measles. “That’s the big question: Does Covid-19 fall into the same category as some of these other vaccine preventable diseases that we do require for school entry, or does it not?” Dr. Nash said. The Biden administration has largely responded to the near vertical rise in coronavirus cases by pushing for more people to get not only their initial doses of vaccine, but booster shots as well. This week, federal health officials endorsed boosters for youths 12 to 17 who had initially gotten the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The government also changed the definition of “up to date” Covid vaccination to include boosters. But even as the United States has moved rapidly to expand who is eligible for boosters, progress in persuading Covid-fatigued Americans to get them has stalled. About 62 percent of Americans — about 206 million people — are fully vaccinated, according to federal data. But according to a C.D.C. database, only about 35 percent of Americans have received a booster since mid-August, when additional shots were first authorized, even as eligibility has greatly expanded. On Nov. 19, the F.D.A. authorized boosters for everyone 18 and older who had received two doses of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, and on Dec. 9, it authorized boosters of the Pfizer vaccine for 16- and 17-year-olds. Those changes led to more Americans getting boosters, according to the federal database, but that has since leveled off. After the discovery of the Omicron variant in late November, the pace of all vaccinations sped up, but it peaked in early December, and then it plateaued. (Reporting lags around the Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s holidays have affected the daily numbers throughout this period.) Omicron, which is highly transmissible, has shown that it is better at evading vaccines than other variants. But scientists say booster shots can offer substantial protection, especially against severe disease. The United States is averaging a staggering 585,000 cases a day, a record and a 247 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are rising more slowly, up 53 percent in the past two weeks, and a smaller percentage of patients are landing in intensive care units or requiring mechanical ventilation, compared with those in previous waves. Deaths are down by 3 percent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention went even further in encouraging booster shots on Wednesday, when health officials recommended that to remain up to date, people should get three doses of Pfizer’s or Moderna’s vaccines. The agency also recommended that recipients of Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose vaccine receive a second dose, preferably of Moderna’s or Pfizer’s. “There really isn’t debate here in what people should do,” the C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, said in an interview on Tuesday. “If they’re eligible for a boost, they should get boosted.” Still, the expansion of booster shot eligibility has not been met with an equal amount of demand. Dr. Rebekah E. Gee, the former health secretary of Louisiana, chalked up the resistance to boosters to pandemic fatigue. Referring to the pandemic’s many problems, Dr. Gee said some people simply “don’t want this to be there” and are trying to “will it out of existence.”"
164,The New York Times,nytimes,"The pandemic has upended children’s lives. “But until I spent time pulling together data and reading reports, I did not understand just how alarming the situation had become,” David Leonhardt writes. He gives ​an overview in The Morning newsletter.",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3Hsfkyo%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2FQ2NRLXNTRgU-_ZwnqQUjDfvyX0qSSrdJQOx_y6sLTnrNgTeZWlBxyUA&h=AT26XUlmkuv_-MtTnZzFBhTpxauNbPZBvegnjshJopX8qi8EwGz41uFk8iVw6PkCfvEK_43UM3Zl_nkdpLKj8mI100Z5WR0ARqH7AIOnDB_l1zzHH0-hUs_WJ9aqjd5Rl6y3x6ipFrODExy1Ezbl&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT2A6qc_LaIPtHuxc3JeC_ivwc5P8ewchS6qDrDpoVqIgY7fe1pJwzRZ9YTeRpBMcDib2WZa8fxQ-v_M5jwRMqscbNqgmcgbqWjYVE13_giflK5zF7uWe1eTTc1Z7-b5r8ERM2u2dVB9XEE4_LKn9yxQpIFuQ_5WOyteTfQDqwpcAU-f,2d,"Inflation remains rapid as the economy enters 2022, and Democrats have begun pointing to a new culprit for the high and lasting price increases: Greedy corporations. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and the White House spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, have been among those pointing to excessive profits in certain industries as one thing jacking up costs for consumers. They don’t blame overall inflation on price-gouging businesses — but the implication is that higher prices are partly the product of corporate opportunism. The explanation for inflation is the latest in a string Democrats have offered since price gains shot up to uncomfortably high levels last year. It is partly grounded in economic reality, partly in political necessity: Rising prices are burdening and unsettling consumers, making them a liability for a party with a tenuous hold on Congressional control headed into 2022 midterm elections. Prices are increasing at the fastest pace since 1982, and while inflation is broadly expected to fade in the year ahead, the speed and extent of that moderation is uncertain. Even if price gains slow down, they could remain a headache for the Biden administration if they continue to rise more rapidly than was normal before the pandemic — which is what economists increasingly expect. They had hovered around or below 2 percent for years, but Federal Reserve officials think they will reach an average of 2.6 percent by the end of this year. The administration has limited power over prices: It is making tweaks around the edges to help to tamp them down, but keeping a lid on inflation is mostly the job of the Fed, which has signaled it expects to begin raising interest rates this year to help control it. Still, as consumers feel the pinch of higher prices for food, gas and household goods, it’s creating a political messaging problem for Democrats. Lawmakers and the White House had initially argued that fast inflation was a sign that airfares and hotel rates were bouncing back and would fade quickly, but supply chain snarls and booming consumer demand for goods kept them elevated throughout 2021. More recently, price pressures have begun to broaden to service categories, like rent, in which increases tend to be long-lasting — and as wages climb swiftly, it raises the possibility that companies will keep lifting prices to cover their costs. As inflation proves stubbornly sticky, administration officials and prominent lawmakers have refined their message to focus more blame on corporations, especially those in concentrated industries with a handful of powerful firms, like meat processing or gas. Many companies — from car dealerships to beauty stores and beef sellers — are raking in bigger profits as they successfully raise their prices or discount less while still managing to sell as much or more. But economists have pointed out that in many cases, blaming big firms for worsening inflation is overly simplistic. Industries have been relatively concentrated for years, but businesses now have the wherewithal to charge more because consumers are spending strongly. That owes partly to government stimulus checks and other benefits that have put more money in shoppers’ pockets. “It’s what you would fully expect when demand goes up,” said Jason Furman, a Harvard economist and a former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration. The laws of supply and demand have not stopped many on the political left from calling companies out. “Profits at the biggest U.S. companies shot above $3 trillion this year, and the margins keep growing,” Mr. Brown, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said during a recent hearing. “Mega corporations would rather pass higher costs on to consumers than cut into their profits.” Ms. Warren has pointed to robust corporate profits as a sign that companies are partly to blame for rising costs. “Corporations are exploiting the pandemic to gouge consumers with higher prices on everyday essentials, from milk to gasoline,” she posted on Twitter on Nov. 26. “American families shouldn’t be bankrolling corporate America’s record-high profits.” And White House economic advisers have pointed to what they have called price gouging behavior in a few specific, concentrated industries. Mr. Biden has publicly encouraged an examination of oil company pricing, and the administration has announced measures to try to combat price fixing in meat processing, pointing out that four large companies control 85 percent of the beef market. “When too few companies control such a large portion of the market, our food supply chains are susceptible to shocks,” the administration said in a Jan. 3 release, repeating an argument administration officials have increasingly highlighted.  “I would say there are some areas where we have seen corporations benefit, profit from the pandemic,” Ms. Psaki said at a news conference in December. It is the case that big company profits are surging across many industries, a sign that companies are either selling more goods and services or are managing to eke more profit out of each unit that they are selling thanks to higher prices or better productivity. Based on corporate earnings calls and a spate of data, it’s likely a combination of those factors. Using data reported by Standard & Poor’s, the market analyst Edward Yardeni estimates that 2021 was a year of robust profit margins — the amount companies earn after subtracting their costs. After contracting sharply early in the pandemic, margins jumped to a record-high 13.7 percent in the second quarter before ticking down to 13.6 percent in the third. He thinks that owes partly to efficiency improvements, and partly to the fact that some firms have raised prices by more than their costs have climbed, something that they had previously struggled to do without losing customers. “It kind of became culturally acceptable to raise prices,” Mr. Yardeni said. “Consumers could understand that many corporations are under pressure to pass on their costs.” Earnings calls are replete with businesses talking about pushing their rising expenses onto their customers without selling less. Anecdotally, some of the industries hit hardest by pandemic shortages, like used car dealers, report managing to charge even more than their costs are increasing. Car dealer profit margins “remained above their long-run averages,” a recent Fed survey of business contacts found, based on interviews in the central bank’s Chicago district. The Richmond, Va., district’s contacts reported similar trends. But several economists said that, for the most part, blaming business profit seeking for today’s price increases does not make sense. Corporate concentration has been high for years, but inflation had been low for decades. Any rational company would want to raise prices without hurting sales: The pandemic, and the government’s response to it, have given today’s firms the ability to do so. “It is the compound effect of the Covid disruptions and the stimulus package at the same time,” said Thomas Philippon, an economist at New York University who studies corporate concentration. “The firms were always greedy.” While concentration may give companies more ability to capitalize on an unusual moment — perhaps they can react faster as consumer expectations shift — the firms charging more are not all big and dominant. America has plenty of car dealerships. The administration’s policies may be part of the reason that companies are newly managing to charge more without losing business, some economists have argued. Households amassed large saving stockpiles during the pandemic, both because people were stuck at home early on and because the government sent out repeated relief and stimulus checks. Many qualified for expanded unemployment benefits or a more generous Child Tax Credit. Those savings have helped consumers to buy more, even as prices have begun rising. And while people are now spending down their cash piles as support programs expire — and sentiment data shows that they are feeling more and more uncomfortable about the economy as prices climb — rising wages could help to keep consumer spending strong. The mix also matters. Consumers are still funneling their dollars heavily toward goods. That could keep supply chains roiled and prices rising. It is hard to tell whether companies will continue to win out. Their costs are also increasing quickly.  Climbing production expenses may take time to fully show up in corporate earnings, since companies make forward-looking contracts for parts. In addition, fresh labor contracts containing big pay increases are shaping up only now. “I don’t really see any great evidence that businesses are raising prices by any more than you would expect, given the rising cost of inputs and labor,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “There’s a distinction to be made here between pricing power — passing on a cost increase, and pricing power — widening a margin.”"

Fitness companies and weight-loss programs know that they have to sign us up in January, when our willpower is the strongest: By February, we begin to tire; by March, having lost five pounds, we revert to our old habits. The deeper problem, as my father would put it, is the “triumph of hope over expectation.” The only way to change the path of expectation is to face and dissect why our resolutions failed before. That road leads to many unexpected destinations far beyond willpower. As it goes for each of us, so it goes for the nation. Physical trainers know that spot reductions are unfeasible: To lose fat and strengthen muscle, one must follow a workout program for the entire body. The same precept applies to an entire range of individual, organizational and social change. Behaviors we want to alter represent deeper patterns of action and inaction. Changing systems requires a strategic plan. Here’s how it works at the individual level. To lose 20 pounds, I have to eat less. That doesn’t mean focusing on short-term denial, since dieting rarely works in the long term. It means changing my eating habits and having healthy, tasty food readily available. To have healthy, tasty food available, I have to plan my meals on a weekly basis. I also have to make time to cook in advance so that I don’t open the fridge when I’m really hungry and realize that cooking something healthy will mean that it won’t reach my plate for another hour. To have that weekly planning and cooking time, I have to free up a big chunk of Sunday. To free up a big chunk of Sunday, I need to work less so that I don’t spend so much of my weekends catching up on work I could not get to during the week. To work less means summoning the honesty to remove a whole set of psychological barriers to saying no. And changing all of these patterns will affect my family and my colleagues, requiring them to adapt and adjust their own habits. Alternatively, suppose this year you resolve to repair a relationship with a family member or a friend with whom you have fallen out or lost touch. A casual email or phone call is unlikely to suffice. It’s worth asking yourself, why did the relationship fray? Most important, what did you do that led or contributed to the fraying? What now needs to be undone or requires acknowledgment and apology? The process of turning back to someone else is likely to require some uncomfortable time with yourself. What would this process look like at the national level? Take one of our biggest challenges as a nation, polarization and societal division. The news of our views of one another is unrelentingly bleak. The nonprofit research group More in Common recently reported that “less than one in four Americans believe the federal government, American corporations and national media to be honest.” Worse: We fundamentally mistrust one another. We tend to focus on battles over specific issues — gun laws, immigration policy, abortion — but lasting change in the United States must go deeper than efforts to reform individual policy areas. It will require a majority of Americans coming to believe that what we have in common with other Americans is greater than our differences. For many of us, that shift will require a fundamental reckoning with who we are and have been as a nation. White Americans who can see ourselves in the traditional Pilgrim-pioneer narrative, even if our families came to this country under very different circumstances, will have to see the experience of enslavement, genocide, domestic terrorism, second-class citizenship and extortion as our history, too. We must own the ways that the foundational inequities of this country continue to play out today. Squaring that history, and its enduring legacies, with our professed ideals of universal liberty, equality and justice will come only by being radically honest about our past, gathering our courage to reckon, honor, heal and repair. Personal and political change are different processes, differing according to the people and the polities concerned. But both require identifying big long-term goals and the smaller, immediate steps that will allow us to meet them. Perhaps that means we change the books we read, the commentators we turn to, the communities we join or the way we engage in conversation. To tackle national polarization at the individual level, we can try to recover our plural identities. Instead of seeing one another primarily as red or blue, we can find channels of connection as moms, dads, sports fans, fellow denizens of a specific state (Texans are often Texans before they are either Democrats or Republicans), gardeners, people of faith, cancer survivors, science fiction lovers, outdoor enthusiasts. Recognizing that political antagonists are multifaceted people with multiple reasons for their views is a move toward what the journalist Amanda Ripley describes as “complicating the narrative.” And rejecting a simple good-versus-evil frame is a key step in defusing conflict. We could also reconsider our consumption of political news. Cable television and radio talk shows profit from exploiting our divisions. But those divisions are a single dimension of our lives, not the sum of our humanity. We can change our conversational habits, committing to asking questions rather than making statements and to actually listening to the answers. And when discussions get heated, we can ask the person we are trying to persuade, “What kind of evidence would convince you?” We can also ask ourselves the same question. Imagine the country you want to see in 2022 and in the years to come. Choose one change that would give you hope and pride. Find a group working to bring that change about. Join it. And figure out what else in your life you have to do and change to make your resolution real."

Un AirTag es un disco de 31,9 milímetros de diámetro que puede rastrear tu ubicación y que Apple empezó a vender a principios de este año como una forma de “estar al pendiente de tus cosas”. Estrada, de 24 años, no tenía uno, ni tampoco los amigos con los que estaba. La notificación en su celular decía que el AirTag había estado por primera vez con ella cuatro horas antes. Un mapa del historial del AirTag mostraba el recorrido en zigzag que Estrada había hecho por la ciudad mientras hacía mandados. “Me sentí violada”, dijo. “Pensé: ¿quién me está rastreando? ¿Cuál era su intención conmigo? Me dio miedo”. Estrada no está sola en su experiencia. En los últimos meses, la gente ha publicado en TikTok, Reddit y Twitter que ha encontrado AirTags en sus autos y en sus pertenencias. Cada vez es más grande la preocupación de que los dispositivos puedan estar fomentando una nueva forma de acoso, algo que los grupos de defensa de la privacidad predijeron que podría ocurrir cuando Apple presentó los dispositivos en abril. El New York Times habló con siete mujeres que creen haber sido rastreadas con AirTags, incluyendo una joven de 17 años cuya madre colocó a escondidas una en su carro para estar al tanto de su paradero. Algunas autoridades han empezado a examinar más de cerca la amenaza que suponen los AirTags. El Departamento de Policía de West Seneca, en Nueva York, advirtió hace poco a su comunidad sobre el potencial de rastreo de los dispositivos después de que se encontrara un AirTag en la defensa de un auto. La policía de West Seneca informó que Apple cumplió con un citatorio para obtener información sobre el AirTag en el caso, lo que podría dar lugar a la presentación de cargos. Y en Canadá, un departamento de policía local anunció que había investigado cinco incidentes de ladrones que colocaban AirTags en “vehículos de alta gama para poder localizarlos y robarlos después”. Los investigadores creen que los AirTags, equipados con tecnología Bluetooth, podrían estar revelando un problema más generalizado de rastreo con tecnología. Emiten una señal digital que puede ser detectada por dispositivos con el sistema operativo móvil de Apple. Esos dispositivos avisan después dónde se vio por última vez un AirTag. A diferencia de otros productos similares de la competencia, como Tile, Apple ha añadido funciones para evitar abusos, como notificaciones como la que recibió Estrada y señales automáticas con sonido. (Tile tiene previsto lanzar una función para evitar el seguimiento de personas este año, según señaló un portavoz de esa empresa). Sin embargo, los AirTags presentan una amenaza “singularmente dañina” porque la ubicuidad de los productos de Apple permite un seguimiento más exacto de los movimientos de las personas, dijo Eva Galperin, directora de ciberseguridad de la Electronic Frontier Foundation que estudia el llamado “stalkerware”, o software de acoso. “Apple convirtió automáticamente todos los dispositivos iOS en parte de la red que utilizan las AirTags para informar de la ubicación de un AirTag”, explicó Galperin. “La red a la que Apple tiene acceso es mayor y más potente que la que utilizan los demás rastreadores. Es más potente para el rastreo y más peligrosa para el acoso”. Apple no revela las cifras de ventas, pero los diminutos AirTags de 29 dólares han demostrado ser populares, pues se han agotado constantemente desde su presentación en el mercado. Un portavoz de Apple, Alex Kirschner, señaló mediante un comunicado que la empresa se toma “muy en serio” la seguridad de los clientes y está “comprometida con la privacidad y la seguridad de los AirTag”. Explicó que los pequeños dispositivos tienen características que informan a los usuarios si un AirTag desconocido podría estar con ellos y que disuaden a los malos actores de usar un AirTag para fines nefastos. “Si los usuarios sienten que su seguridad está en peligro, los animamos a que se pongan en contacto con las fuerzas de seguridad locales, que pueden trabajar con Apple para proporcionar toda la información disponible sobre el AirTag desconocido”, aseguró Kirschner. La policía podría pedir a Apple que proporcionara información sobre el propietario del AirTag, lo que permitiría identificar al culpable. No obstante, algunas de las personas que hablaron con el Times no pudieron encontrar los AirTags de los que fueron notificados y dijeron que la policía no siempre toma en serio los informes de las notificaciones en sus celulares. Después de salir la noche de un viernes de diciembre con su novio, Erika Torres, una graduada de música en Nueva Orleans, recibió en su iPhone la notificación de que un “dispositivo desconocido” había sido detectado cerca de ella durante un periodo de dos horas, y la había seguido desde el bar hasta su casa. Llamó a la policía y llamó a Apple, pero nunca encontró el AirTag. Un representante de Apple le dijo que otros dispositivos podrían activar la alerta, como los AirPods. Cuando Torres publicó un video sobre su experiencia en YouTube, una decena de personas comentaron que les había sucedido lo mismo. “La cantidad de informes me hace pensar que debe haber algún tipo de falla que está causando que todas estas personas experimenten esto”, dijo Torres. “Espero que no todos estén siendo acosados”. Estrada, quien recibió la notificación mientras estaba en Los Ángeles, acabó encontrando el rastreador del tamaño de una moneda alojado en un espacio detrás de la matrícula de su Dodge Charger 2020. Publicó un video de su experiencia en TikTok, que se hizo viral. “Quizá Apple lanzó este producto con la intención de hacer el bien, pero esto demuestra que la tecnología puede ser utilizada para fines buenos y malos”, dijo Estrada. Estrada refirió que un agente de la policía de Los Ángeles le dijo que su situación no era una emergencia y que, si quería presentar una denuncia, tendría que llevar el dispositivo a la comisaría por la mañana. No quiso esperar y se deshizo de él tras tomar varias fotos. Un portavoz de la policía de Los Ángeles le comentó al Times que el departamento no había sabido de casos en los que se hubiera utilizado un AirTag para rastrear a una persona o un vehículo. Sin embargo, Estrada dijo que después de publicar su video en TikTok, un empleado de Apple, actuando por su cuenta, se puso en contacto con ella. El empleado pudo conectar el AirTag con una mujer cuya dirección estaba en el centro de Los Ángeles. Otra mujer fue notificada por su iPhone que estaba siendo rastreada por un “accesorio desconocido” después de salir de su gimnasio en noviembre. Llamó a la policía cuando llegó a su casa. A la mujer —Michaela Clough residente de Corning, California— se le dijo que solo se podía abrir un reporte si alguien se presentaba en su casa y que las notificaciones de Apple no eran prueba suficiente de que estaba siendo acosada. Más tarde se puso en contacto con un representante de servicio al cliente de Apple que pudo desconectar el dispositivo del iPhone de Clough. El dispositivo nunca fue encontrado. “Estaba asustada y frustrada porque no había nada que pudiera hacer al respecto”, dijo Clough, y señaló que no había regresado a su gimnasio desde entonces. “Durante una semana, solo me quedé en casa”. Las AirTags y otros productos conectados a la red de seguimiento de localización de Apple, llamada Encontrar (Find My), activan alertas a los iPhones desconocidos con los que viajan. La página del producto AirTag en el sitio web de Apple señala que los dispositivos están “diseñados para desalentar el rastreo no deseado” y que reproducirán un sonido después de cierto tiempo de no detectar el dispositivo al que están sincronizados. En junio, después de que surgiera la preocupación por el acoso, Apple actualizó las AirTags para que empezaran a emitir un sonido al cabo de un día de estar alejadas de sus dispositivos vinculados, en lugar de tres días. Aun así, “no emiten un pitido muy fuerte”, dijo Galperin. Una persona que no tenga un iPhone podría tener más dificultades para detectar una AirTag no deseada. Las AirTags no son compatibles con los teléfonos inteligentes Android. A principios de este mes, Apple lanzó una aplicación para Android que puede escanear en busca de AirTags, pero hay que estar lo suficientemente atento para descargarla y utilizarla de forma proactiva. Apple no quiso decir si estaba trabajando con Google en una tecnología que permitiera a los celulares Android detectar de manera automática sus rastreadores. Las personas que dicen haber sido rastreadas han calificado de insuficientes las salvaguardias de Apple. Estrada dijo que se le notificó cuatro horas después de que su teléfono detectara por primera vez el dispositivo. Otros dijeron que pasaron días antes de que se dieran cuenta de un AirTag desconocido. Según Apple, el tiempo de las alertas puede variar en función del sistema operativo del iPhone y de los ajustes de localización. Las inconsistencias de los dispositivos han causado confusión a las personas a las que no necesariamente se les estaba siguiendo con malas intenciones. Mary Ford, una estudiante de secundaria de 17 años de Cary, Carolina del Norte, recibió una notificación a fines de octubre de que estaba siendo rastreada por un AirTag desconocido después de conducir a una cita. Entró en pánico mientras registraba su coche. Ford se percató de que no era una amenaza cuando su madre le reveló que había puesto el rastreador en el vehículo unas dos semanas antes para seguir el paradero de su hija. “Estaba nerviosa porque Mary salía y no podía localizarla”, dijo su madre, Wendy Ford. Aseguró que no había tenido la intención de ocultarle a su hija del AirTag, “pero si hubiera sabido que le enviarían una notificación, probablemente se lo habría dicho”. Jahna Maramba rentó un automóvil del servicio de coches compartidos Turo en noviembre en Los Ángeles, luego recibió una notificación sobre un AirTag desconocido cerca de ella un sábado por la noche cuando estaba con sus amigas. Llevó el carro al estacionamiento de su amiga, donde revisó su exterior durante una hora antes de que el propietario le dijera que había puesto el dispositivo dentro del vehículo. Maramba había estado conduciendo el auto durante dos días. Un portavoz de Turo dijo en un comunicado que la compañía no tiene control sobre la tecnología que utilizan los propietarios de automóviles en los vehículos que alquilan. “Imagínate enterarte a través de una notificación de que está siendo rastreada”, dijo Maramba. “Y no puedes hacer nada al respecto”."

High-risk patients carrying the Delta variant could benefit greatly from two particular monoclonal antibody treatments shown to reduce hospitalization and death. But those medications would most likely do nothing for patients with Omicron, who would only respond to a third antibody treatment that is in very short supply. While U.S. officials have endorsed using a workaround test that can identify Omicron’s genetic signature, experts say it’s not feasible for large health systems facing a crush of patients to employ in each case. That makes treating patients challenging in places like Maryland, where cases are spiking and Omicron accounts for roughly 58 percent of them. The Delta variant is also holding strong in the Great Plains and swaths of the West, including California. While there is no approved test to determine each individual’s variant, a national network of state and other labs use genome-sequencing tests to track variants broadly in communities. Health systems then use those regional estimates or their own data to decide which antibody treatments to use in their clinics and hospitals. Many of them concluded that a community of largely Delta patients would benefit most from the antibody drugs made by Regeneron and Eli Lilly, while communities where Omicron patients are predominant would benefit from antibodies from GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology. Federal officials have dabbled with making the decision for the nation. On Dec. 23, they stopped shipments of antibody treatments by Eli Lilly and Regeneron after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 73 percent of U.S. Covid cases were Omicron. An outcry followed from Republican political leaders, who argued that some people in their states were still infected with Delta. And on Tuesday, the C.D.C. slashed its estimate of national Omicron cases to 59 percent. On Dec. 31, federal officials resumed national shipping all of the antibody treatments. For the next few weeks, as the country grapples with this uneven mix of both variants, tailoring treatments to each patient will be “extraordinarily difficult,” said Dr. Alex Greninger, assistant director of the clinical virology laboratories at the University of Washington Medical Center. Dr. Greninger is credited with developing one of the first tests to detect the coronavirus in the United States. But he is pessimistic that health systems can pivot quickly to sort out which patients have Delta or Omicron. And although a shortcut test can detect Omicron, there’s no simple way to report the results in bulk, he said. What’s more, the genome sequencing used by public health officials takes nearly a week — too long to target the early antibody treatments that have been found to reduce the need for hospitalizations. That makes patient care particularly difficult right now, said Dr. Mark Siedner, an infectious disease clinician and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital. In Massachusetts and nearby states, an estimated 44.5 percent of cases are Omicron. Dr. Siedner said his health system has stopped using the Regeneron and Eli Lilly antibodies that are not effective against Omicron and are “anxiously awaiting” more doses of the effective treatment by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology. “We’re in a holding pattern and it’s a terrible time to be in that place,” he said. Officials across the United States, from President Biden on down, have been insisting that they are no longer in the shutdown business, and will not order any closures to contain the latest surge in coronavirus cases. But Omicron may be taking the decision out of their hands. So many workers are testing positive or calling in sick that businesses, schools, government agencies and more are being crippled by staff shortages that may force them to close some operations anyway. Airlines began canceling flights in large numbers on Christmas Eve for lack of crews, and the problems have continued into the new year. Broadway shows have been canceled because of outbreaks backstage. Major companies have delayed or entirely jettisoned return-to-office plans. Many colleges are switching back to virtual classes to start the semester. And public school leaders are struggling to respond to a situation that has changed greatly from when students went on holiday breaks before Christmas, barely a week ago. Four large city school systems — Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Newark — have joined a growing list of public schools around the country that put off reopening on Monday, switched to remote instruction, or both. Covid-19 outbreaks and staffing shortages forced their hands. Omicron has driven case numbers to staggering new heights: The United States is averaging more than 484,600 daily cases over the past week, a 238 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are up 41 percent in the past two weeks, while deaths are down by 3 percent. In some cases, the very resources needed to cope with Omicron’s staffing disruptions are themselves being disrupted, from the call-center agents who rebook canceled flights to the frontline medical professionals who care for sick workers. Infected police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and transit workers are leaving shifts unfilled. In New York City, subway lines have been delayed by staff shortages, and the Fire Department has asked residents not to call 911 except in a real emergency. Many elected leaders of both parties have discarded their sharpest pandemic-curbing tools, like closing government offices, schools and businesses, which have come with staggering economic, social and political costs. Instead, elected officials have stressed the importance of vaccination, booster shots and mask-wearing. “I am not prepared to shut down schools or the economy at this time,” Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York, a Democrat, said before New York suffered a string of new daily case records last week. “I will not overreact and send this economy spiraling out of control once again.” Many leading public health experts aren’t seeking shutdowns, either. If anything, many appear to be taking an opposite tack. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced new guidelines to help schools stay open, by allowing children who are exposed to the coronavirus to “test to stay” instead of automatically having to quarantine at home. And it has said that some Americans who test positive can leave isolation after five days, half as long as previous recommendations. A federal judge granted a preliminary injunction on Monday blocking the Department of Defense from taking “any adverse action” against 35 Navy sailors who have refused to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, arguing that it violated their religious freedoms. The service members — including Navy SEALs and members of the Naval Special Warfare Command — had filed suit against the Biden administration arguing that their “sincerely held religious beliefs forbid each of them from receiving the Covid-19 vaccine for a variety of reasons based upon their Christian faith.” The Pentagon had mandated that all active-duty troops receive the vaccine. The judge, Reed O’Connor of the Northern District of Texas, effectively blocked the department from punishing those troops. “Our nation asks the men and women in our military to serve, suffer, and sacrifice. But we do not ask them to lay aside their citizenry and give up the very rights they have sworn to protect,” Judge O’Connor wrote in his 26-page order. He added: “The Covid-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no Covid-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.” The group represents a small fraction of active-duty troops from the United States, and as of mid-December, most active-duty soldiers and members of the Navy had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Thousands have requested religious exemptions, and none have been granted so far, officials said in December. The decision follows another injunction by a judge in November against President Biden’s national vaccine mandate for health care workers. Judge O’Connor, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, has reliably tossed several Democratic policies that have been challenged on the federal bench. In response to the injunction on Monday, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, wrote on Twitter, “This is a major win!” A spokesperson for the Pentagon could not immediately be reached for comment. But on Monday evening, John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said that defense officials were reviewing the injunction, according to The Washington Post. The coronavirus is spreading faster than ever at the start of 2022, but the last days of 2021 brought some encouraging news about the latest wave of infections. With growing evidence that the Omicron variant produces less severe illness than in earlier waves, governments are redoubling their focus on vaccinations and boosters, which are increasingly seen as the world’s ticket to “living with Covid.” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert, said on Sunday that hospitalizations, which are not rising as fast, were a more important barometer than reported cases for the severity of the Omicron wave, a sharp distinction after nearly two years of tallying daily case counts. “As you get further on and the infections become less severe, it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations as opposed to the total number of cases,” Dr. Fauci said. Still, the case numbers remain staggering. The world is recording an average of nearly 1.5 million new cases every day, twice as many per day as were recorded nearly a week ago, although the figures in many places may have been distorted by holiday reporting delays. In the United States, experts forecast that the Omicron wave could crest in mid-January, but not before millions were infected every week. Across Europe, caseloads have soared to new highs and ushered in another bitter winter of social restrictions, mask mandates and shifting travel rules. The holidays made things worse as colder weather and festive gatherings drove people indoors, where the virus circulates more easily. Airports and mass transit hubs were snarled with travelers after many people stayed home last year. And with many government offices closed, testing and case data were not being compiled as regularly, leaving officials and experts, at least temporarily, with an incomplete picture of how bad things were getting. As much of the world returns to work this week, however, several trends are becoming clearer: Although many governments are loath to lock down again, officials are tweaking rules to account for Omicron’s blazing spread. Paris last week became the latest European city to reimpose an outdoor mask mandate. South Korea joined France and others in setting an expiry date for its vaccine passes, hoping to push more people to get boosters. Here are some other trends to watch for: Mayor Eric Adams insisted on Monday morning that New York City’s schools would stay open despite an extraordinary surge in Omicron cases. But about a third of city parents did not send their children back to classrooms on the first day after the holiday break. Attendance was just over 67 percent, slightly higher than the low point of 65 percent the system reached on the day before winter break. Throughout the day on Monday, Adams was adamant that the system would remain open. He repeated the message in a series of television interviews and after his first official school visit since taking office on New Year’s Day. “We’re really excited about the opening of our schools,” Mr. Adams said outside the school, Concourse Village Elementary School in the Bronx. “We want to be extremely clear: the safest place for our children is a school building.” Mr. Adams said that remote learning had been disastrous for too many of the city’s nearly one million schoolchildren in the nation’s largest school district, and had been particularly harmful for children in low-income neighborhoods and homeless students. But the calm that Mr. Adams sought to project was not shared by the many parents and educators who greeted Monday morning with profound trepidation. After roughly a year of remarkably low virus transmission in schools, Covid cases soared in the week before the winter break, prompting the closures of 11 schools and over 400 classrooms, and the contact tracing system for city schools effectively collapsed amid the surge. New York City reported 35,650 new virus cases on Sunday, with a 7-day average test positivity rate of nearly 22 percent, according to state data. Some families and elected officials have called on Mr. Adams to delay the start of school by a few days to allow every child and educator to get tested. And teachers have raised questions about how schools will be properly staffed with so many teachers sick with the virus or quarantining due to exposures. “This is an all hands on deck moment,” Mr. Adams said, acknowledging that administrators who are not normally in the classroom would be used to address staff shortages if necessary. Mr. Adams has endorsed a plan created by former Mayor Bill de Blasio that is designed to keep more classrooms open as the surge continues. The plan calls for distributing 1.5 million rapid at-home test kits to schools. Starting Monday, the city is also doubling its random in-school testing program to give P.C.R. tests to 20 percent of consenting children in each school weekly. But most families have not opted in to allow their children to be tested, which has made the testing pool very small at some schools. The mayor and the new schools chancellor, David C. Banks, are betting that their plan to increase testing will prevent major outbreaks. “We’re going to turn those question marks into an exclamation point: we’re staying open,” Mr. Adams said. Mr. Adams and Mr. Banks have so far resisted calls to mandate booster shots for educators or vaccines for children. The mayor has said a decision will be made this spring about mandating vaccines for students for the fall. “We’re not at the point of mandate,” Mr. Adams said Monday, as he encouraged eligible New Yorkers to get vaccinated and boosted. Michael Mulgrew, president of the city’s teachers’ union, said in an email to members that he had encouraged Mr. Adams to start the year remotely. But on Monday morning, Mr. Mulgrew said he was working closely with the new mayor and that schools had been some of the safest places in the city throughout the pandemic. Later on Monday, Gov. Kathy Hochul reiterated her commitment to keeping New York’s children in schools. “My view is that every child should be back in school unless they are testing positive,” she said. The state has distributed 5.2 million at-home test kits to schools thus far, and another 3.8 million arrived yesterday and have yet to be distributed. Under the current rule, test kits will only be provided to students for known exposures that occur in classrooms, although Ms. Hochul said that policy was under review. She also cautioned against a return to remote learning. “The teachers did the best they could. The parents did the best they could,” she said. “But we ask too much.” In particular, she spoke about the effects of remote learning on children in communities of color, those who lacked resources and those without high-speed internet access — an existing digital divide that she said had widened into a “digital canyon.” “We cannot have that,” Ms. Hochul said. “That was an injustice. We cannot have that anymore.” SACRAMENTO — With the Omicron variant raging across California, millions of schoolchildren returned to classrooms on Monday, ending the holiday break as many had spent it — masked, distanced, apprehensive and in long lines with their parents, scrambling for coronavirus tests. Few schools were closed in a state whose Covid-19 precautions have been among the most aggressive in the nation. California has managed to maintain comparatively low rates of virus-related deaths and hospitalizations. But infections have soared recently because of the highly contagious variant, which appears to result in less severe cases. In hundreds of districts, in-person instruction was conditioned on heightened health requirements and fraught with the understanding that even those might not prevent a return to remote learning. “Frankly, the disruption I’m worried about isn’t Day 1 — it’s Day 2, 3 or 4 if we get 30 or 40 or 50 positive cases,” said Alex Cherniss, the superintendent of the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, where, after days of impassioned community debate, some 10,000 students in coastal Los Angeles County returned to class on Monday. “People are exhausted here,” he said. California’s largest school district, Los Angeles Unified, was not scheduled to resume classes until next week. But on Monday, the district issued new rules requiring baseline testing as a condition of returning to campus, regardless of vaccination status. Previously, testing had been optional for vaccinated and asymptomatic students and employees. In many other districts, reopening classrooms on Monday also hinged on fresh rounds of coronavirus testing. In Marin County, students had been given kits to test for the virus before re-entering campus. In Sacramento County, families stood for hours over the weekend at testing sites hastily erected by school districts or took advantage of an infusion of six million take-home tests the state supplied to districts across California as Omicron was starting to spike. “We did two tests at home and he’s fine,” Emily Ramey said as she dropped off her younger child at a middle school in suburban Sacramento. “I’m just hoping that everyone else tested, too.” Los Angeles Unified already conducts the nation’s largest weekly school-based coronavirus testing program, but health officials in the county have ratcheted up other measures that will affect the hundreds of thousands of students and employees in the school system, along with those in private schools and nearly 80 other public school districts. New health rules starting Jan. 1 mandate, for example, that returning students at all of the county’s districts wear face masks not only indoors but also outside at recess, and that school employees upgrade to medical-grade N95 or KN95 face coverings. Gov. Gavin Newsom has reiterated that the state is “committed” to keeping classrooms open and promised last month to make home testing kits “available to every K-12 public school student as they head back to the classroom from winter break.” But not all districts had received their allotment by Monday. San Francisco schools increased mobile testing sites throughout the city and strongly encouraged students to get tested before returning, in part because they will not receive their allotment of tests from the state until later this week. In Palos Verdes, Mr. Cherniss said concern over Omicron almost prompted the district to delay reopening until next week. But when he announced he was considering it, he said, the outcry from parents was fierce. Eventually, the district opted to reopen as scheduled, but to strongly encourage students to test before returning. “We did a big push over the weekend,” he said. “We handed out 2,000 home tests in less than three hours and did another 2,000 live tests. More than 100 were positive.” The top medical official at the U.S. Capitol urged lawmakers and their staff members on Monday to work remotely and take additional precautions against the coronavirus, after the seven-day positivity rate at the building’s on-site coronavirus test center rose rapidly from less than 1 percent to more than 13 percent. In a letter to congressional offices obtained by The New York Times, Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician, informed lawmakers that there had been an “unprecedented number of cases” among hundreds of people who work in the Capitol complex, with dozens testing positive daily. Of the cases detected, 65 percent were symptomatic, the letter said. As of Dec. 15, a majority of the infections were breakthrough cases, with 61 percent caused by the Omicron variant and 38 percent caused by the Delta variant. The building offers daily testing for lawmakers, their staffs, Capitol workers and journalists who work in the building, and lawmakers were among the first wave of eligible people to receive vaccinations and boosters in the country. The breakthrough infections, Dr. Monahan said, had not led to any hospitalizations, serious complications or deaths. “I urge all individuals also to continue essential measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus,” Dr. Monahan wrote in his letter, encouraging lawmakers to maximize the amount of remote work done in their offices and advising all people in the building to use medical-grade masks. With the Senate set to hold votes on Tuesday, Democrats have now decided to meet virtually for their weekly caucus lunch, according to a senior aide. The House is not set to return until Jan. 10. Dr. Monahan has little authority to enforce his guidance, in an institution where individual congressional offices can set their own policies and guidelines. Mask-wearing in recent months has largely been divided along party lines, with two Republicans, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Andrew Clyde, incurring more than $100,000 combined in fines for flouting the mask mandate on the House floor. The Food and Drug Administration on Monday authorized booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds, a group that became eligible for initial shots in May. Regulators also shortened by a month the amount of time that adult and adolescent recipients of Pfizer’s vaccine should wait between their second and third doses, allowing them to seek booster shots five months after their second injections.  And they allowed some children aged 5 to 11 with immune deficiencies to seek a third shot, including those who have undergone solid organ transplants or have conditions that amount to “an equivalent level of immunocompromise,” the agency said in a statement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee is set to meet Wednesday to review the F.D.A. moves and decide whether to recommend the changes. If it does, the C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, is expected to quickly sign off on them.   The F.D.A. said that it examined data from Israel on more than 6,300 people in the 12- to 15-year-old age group who received booster shots at least five months after a second dose. That data “enabled the F.D.A. to reassess the benefits and risks of the use of a booster in the younger adolescent population in the setting of the current surge in Covid-19 cases,” the agency said. The review showed no new safety concerns, including no new cases of myocarditis, a rare heart-related side effect that has been tied to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, particularly in younger men. The condition involves inflammation of the heart muscle. Dr. Peter Marks, who oversees the agency’s division that regulates vaccines, said that the risk of myocarditis was substantially lower after a booster dose than after a second dose, citing U.S. safety monitoring data. The benefits of a third shot outweighed the potential risks, he said, because it may better protect individuals against both the Delta and Omicron variants. Regulators also relied on Israeli data in shortening the interval between second and third doses of the Pfizer vaccine. No new safety issues have emerged in the United States among more than four million people 16 and older who got a third dose at least five months after a second, the F.D.A. said.  Because studies have shown that a Pfizer booster dose increases protection against the Omicron variant, a shorter interval might offer “better protection sooner,” the agency said. Other studies have shown that the potency of two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine ebbs over time.  “We do know that waning has occurred by five months,” Dr. Janet Woodcock, the F.D.A.’s acting commissioner said at a Monday morning news conference at which she and Dr. Marks gave updates on their deliberations about whether to further expand authorizations for Covid vaccines. The F.D.A. has not received sufficient dataon the benefits of a booster shot of Moderna’s vaccine at five months, and so is sticking to the six-month interval for that vaccine. “We will obviously be receptive to data that are submitted to us from Moderna and we’ll take action on those data with all due speed,” Dr. Marks said. He declined to say whether authorization of a third shot was in the offing for those who received one dose of Johnson & Johnson and a second dose of either Pfizer or Moderna’s vaccine. He said the combination appears “to give a very good immune response,” but that more data is needed over time. Asked about booster shots for 5- to 11- year olds, Dr. Marks said that only about a quarter of them have been vaccinated, mostly in the last two months. “It would be great to get a larger percentage of those kids vaccinated, and then we’ll see how many months afterward we need to get them boosted,” he said. No vaccine is yet authorized for children under five. “We certainly understand that there is a pressing need in that age range,” Dr. Marks said, promising that the F.D.A. “will move with appropriate speed with the appropriate data in hand.” Hospitalizations for the coronavirus are rising steeply in New York State, approaching the peak of last winter’s surge and driving the number of deaths reported in a single day above 100 for the first time since last March, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday. Hospitalizations have now surpassed last winter’s peak in New York City, the governor said. She added that there were some signs that this wave of hospitalizations may not be as severe as past surges, but she said the rapid rise was still “a trend that is troubling.” “We’re not in a good place, I’m going to be really honest with you,” Ms. Hochul said at a news briefing in Rochester, as she announced additional testing sites and the arrival of millions of rapid tests to help schools stay open through the virus spike.  Hospitalizations are being closely watched in New York City, one of the first places to be hit hard by the Omicron variant, as a bellwether for the nation as a whole. Omicron was first reported in New York City a month ago, and led to an enormous surge in new cases, from less than 2,500 per day to nearly 50,000 per day on New Year’s Eve. But in the past 10 days, hospitalizations have started to rise even more steeply than cases in New York City, leaping 130 percent between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve, compared to a 60 percent rise in cases over the same period, state data shows. As of Sunday, more than 4,500 people were hospitalized in the city, 500 of them in intensive care units. Statewide, nearly 9,000 people were hospitalized, and 103 people were reported to have died on Sunday. The number of Covid patients in New York City intensive care units is still lower than the peak of last winter’s surge, before vaccines were widely available, when about 750 people were in intensive care. And hospitalizations remain much lower than when Covid-19 first swept the city in spring 2020 and 12,000 people were hospitalized on the worst days, 3,000 of them in intensive care. Unvaccinated people are far more likely to be hospitalized with Covid-19 than vaccinated people, state data shows. In the week ending Dec. 20, the rate of unvaccinated people hospitalized for Covid statewide was 30 per 100,000, compared to a rate of 2 per 100,000 for the fully vaccinated. The hospitalizations are threatening to wear down a health care system whose ranks are already thinned by infections and attrition during the pandemic, and hospitals are readying emergency staffing plans. More than 20 hospitals across the state have been ordered to stop elective surgeries because they lack the capacity to perform them. But Ms. Hochul said that some hospital executives have told her between 20 and 50 percent of their Covid patients are not suffering from severe symptoms, but that they are testing positive in the hospital incidentally, after being admitted for other reasons such as car accidents. As a result, beginning Tuesday, the state will begin to ask hospitals to break down how many patients are being admitted for acute Covid-19 symptoms, in an effort to further decipher this wave’s severity. “I just want to always want to be honest with New Yorkers about how bad this is,” Ms. Hochul said. “Yes, the sheer numbers of people infected are high, but I want to see if hospitalizations are correlated to that.” With schools open in New York City and much of the state on Monday, and masks still optional in certain fully vaccinated settings, some are calling on the city and state to do more to slow the hospitalizations down. Mark Levine, the Manhattan borough president, called on policymakers to immediately urge people to work from home and avoid large gatherings for the next two weeks, as part of a 16-point plan he released Monday. “Hospitalizations in NYC are rising faster than at any point since March 2020,” he wrote on Twitter. “We can’t just accept this. We have to do more to slow this wave.” The Omicron surge has prompted sharp new limits on the number of journalists allowed to attend White House news briefings. The board of the White House Correspondents Association voted on Sunday to limit attendance to 14 reporters, sitting spaced apart in a room with 49 chairs. Three major news agencies will always be represented, two spots are earmarked for major U.S. television networks, and there will be one pool reporter each for print, radio, TV and foreign outlets. The remaining five seats will be rotated on various schedules among 48 news organizations, including The New York Times. The president of the association, Steve Portnoy of CBS Radio, wrote in an email to members, “Given the virulence of the spread, medical experts have once again advised that it would be prudent to substantially reduce the number of people working in the cramped, poorly ventilated work space that we share.” He said that standing in the briefing room’s aisles, a common practice for reporters without assigned seats, “is not welcome at this time” because photographers need room to maintain social distance as they work. The association is also urging its members to stay away from the White House when not on a specific assignment, to minimize the chances of “an outbreak that might limit our ability to cover the president in close quarters,” Mr. Portnoy wrote. “I promise this won’t last a day longer than necessary,” he said in the email, adding that the board would revisit the situation by Jan. 21. As hospitals already strained by the Delta variant threaten to buckle under a crush of patients infected with the even more contagious Omicron, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci said Americans should focus more on the threat the winter wave poses to hospitals and less on the record number of cases. Over the past week, an average of more than 401,200 cases has been reported each day in the United States, tripling from two weeks ago and the first time the number has topped 400,000, according to a New York Times database (new case numbers are slightly depressed because fewer states are reporting after the New Year holiday). Hospitalizations were by comparison up 33 percent, however, to 92,300, while deaths had dropped 4 percent to an average of 1,249 daily. It’s unclear how many hospitalizations are patients infected with Omicron rather than the Delta variant, which scientists believe is significantly more virulent. According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the week ending Dec. 25, Omicron accounted for over 58 percent of new cases versus over 41 percent for Delta. Dr. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, noted on Sunday on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos” that many new infections, especially in people who are vaccinated and boosted, result in no symptoms or mild symptoms, making the absolute number of cases less important than it was for previous versions of the virus. “As you get further on and the infections become less severe, it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations as opposed to the total number of cases,” Dr. Fauci said. That advice is in keeping with what many epidemiologists have said all along. Despite the daily drumbeat of case counts, the number of positive tests has never been a perfect indicator of the course of the epidemic. The number of cases has exploded because the Omicron variant seems to be much more contagious and able to evade vaccines than other earlier variants, which has spurred more widespread testing. What’s more, the official numbers are almost certainly an undercount, because many people are testing positive on rapid at-home tests or carrying the virus without any symptoms. Yet, as Dr. Fauci told Mr. Stephanopoulos, the concern is not so much the mild or asymptomatic Omicron cases as it is the number of people with severe or fatal infections. “The real bottom line that you want to be concerned about,” he said, “is are we getting protected by the vaccines from severe disease leading to hospitalization?” So far, vaccines and boosters appear to be providing that protection. But the unvaccinated remain at risk. “I’m still very concerned about the tens of millions of people who are not vaccinated at all because even though many of them are going to get asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, a fair number of them are going to get severe disease,” Dr. Fauci said. The Louisiana Department of Health tweeted on Sunday that hospitalizations in the state have topped 1,000, and that 76 percent of those hospitalized “are not up to date” on their vaccination status. Also, even if Omicron is milder, as most evidence suggests, a higher caseload means more health care workers who cannot work because they test positive as well as more chances that people could get sick enough to require medical care. “We have got to be careful about that, because, even if you have a less of a percentage of severity, when you have multi-multi-multi-fold more people getting infected, the net amount is you’re still going to get a lot of people that are going to be needing hospitalization,” Dr. Fauci said.  Hospitals in several states are showing signs of strain and experiencing staffing shortages. “At the moment, the major concern is the effect of Omicron on hospital staffing in conjunction with fatigue and increasing admissions for Covid-19 as well as other things,” said Julio Figueroa, chief of infectious diseases at the Louisiana State School Health Sciences Center.  Hawaii has requested 700 additional health care workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, while some hospitals in the St. Louis area have started to limit visitors again. Leaders in Illinois have urged hospitals to postpone elective surgeries and procedures. The Maryland Hospital Association said that the number of hospital patients had surpassed the state’s Covid peak from last winter. “We believe that the next four to six weeks are really going to be a terrible point in this crisis, and it’s potentially going to be the worst part of the whole two-year fight,” Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland said on the CNN program “State of the Union.” Large city school systems in Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee and Newark have joined a growing list of public schools across the country that have postponed reopening after the holiday break, switched to remote instruction, or have taken both steps because of Covid-19 outbreaks and staffing shortages. Some of the announcements came abruptly, as school leaders struggled to respond to a rapidly changing situation. Some school systems that are open for in-person instruction this week have nonetheless had to shut some school buildings for lack of staff, including eight schools in Columbus, Ohio, and 12 in Pittsburgh. An increasing number of people with compromised immune systems in the U.S. are sidestepping government guidelines to receive unauthorized fourth or fifth shots. The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are in charge of determining when additional doses should be administered, but some patients and their doctors feel that federal agencies have acted too slowly to protect the most vulnerable. Israel has already begun officially offering fourth shots — Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announced on Sunday that the country would offer additional shots to people age 60 and over, as well as to medical workers, becoming the first country to start administering an additional booster so broadly. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidelines in late October to say that immunocompromised people would be eligible for a fourth dose six months after a third. For those who followed the rules, the earliest eligibility for a fourth would be in late February. But as new variants like Omicron arise and vaccination rates continue to be sluggish in many areas, worrying those with weak immune systems, many of them are getting extra shots without being certain of whether they are safe or effective. All secondary school students in England must be tested for the coronavirus before returning to classrooms after the holidays, the British government announced on Monday, in the latest measure aimed at controlling a rise in infections driven by the Omicron variant. Schools have been provided with rapid test kits to administer on site when pupils begin returning to classes this week, officials said, adding that students should continue to test themselves at least twice a week. Older students, including those at universities, had already been advised to test themselves at home before returning to campuses. “We are doing all we can to minimize disruption this virus causes to everyday life, including keeping children in school, and regular testing is a key way to support schools and protect face-to-face teaching,” Britain’s health minister, Sajid Javid, said in a statement. Self-administered rapid antigen tests — known in Britain as lateral-flow tests — have become a ubiquitous part of British life over the past year, provided free by the government through the mail and at pharmacies. Over the holidays, however, supply difficulties and surging demand have often made them more difficult to obtain, with officials blaming a “worldwide shortage.” Officials said on Monday that schools would have access to “a separate supply route” to order additional tests. The government also said that English secondary school students, though not their teachers, would be required to wear masks in classrooms until at least Jan. 26. Masks are already recommended for students in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, where separate devolved governments decide on their own Covid measures.  While those governments reintroduced restrictions on gatherings after Christmas, Mr. Javid and other British officials have said that further restrictions on everyday life in England are not necessary because cases of severe illness are not rising as fast as in previous waves.  Even as Britain recorded its all-time highs in daily cases last week, the health secretary said that the country has “some of the least restrictive measures in Europe,” and argued that high vaccination rates, including a scaled-up booster program, would allow Britons to live with the virus. “Curbs on our freedom must be an absolute last resort and the British people rightly expect us to do everything in our power to avert them,” Mr. Javid wrote in The Daily Mail newspaper on Friday. Data released by British health officials last week added to findings that Omicron might produce less severe illness than previous variants. Still, some experts warned that the sheer number of cases would strain Britain’s health system. Government data showed a 50 percent rise in both hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19 over the past week, with nearly 1,000 people having died within 28 days of a positive test. As of Monday, South Korea’s vaccine passes will have a six-month expiration date, as the health authorities seek to manage the country’s “living with Covid” strategy. Under the vaccine pass system, which started in mid-December, visitors to public places like restaurants, cafes, sports facilities and movie theaters must present proof of vaccination to gain access. (Proof of a recent negative P.C.R. test is also accepted.) With the tightened rules, those who received two doses of the coronavirus vaccine must get a booster shot within six months, or their vaccine passes — issued 14 days after getting a second dose — will be void. (Negative test results issued within 48 hours will still be accepted.) Fines or administrative action against violators will begin starting on Jan. 10, according to Yonhap News Agency. Both people who flout the rule and venues that fail to enforce it could face punishment. The vaccine pass system has spurred debate in South Korea over whether it is forcing people to take the vaccine. The country has fully vaccinated 83 percent of its population, according to Our World in Data, and on Monday Korean health officials reported 3,129 new daily cases of the virus. After weeks of record-breaking case counts, the country has had a 34 percent drop in daily cases over the past week. Other countries have also begun adding expiration dates to a primary vaccine regimen. Starting in February, the European Union Covid Certificate will have a validity period of nine months, and booster shots will be mandatory for travel across several countries on the continent. And beginning next week, the United Arab Emirates is set to bar people from leaving the country unless they have received three doses of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the state news agency WAM. Britain announced a goal to administer boosters to all adults by the end of the month, and Israel last week approved of a fourth shot for people with weak immune systems and others at high risk, including those 60 and over, and health care workers. The United States has been slower in its booster rollout, with only one-third of fully vaccinated adults receiving another shot as of mid-December. Chile will also offer its eligible residents a fourth coronavirus vaccine dose from February, President Sebastián Piñera announced. Health care workers, older people and those with chronic diseases would be given shots first. Vietnam has urged China, one of its major trading partners, to ease the measures local Chinese officials put in place at a key border crossing to fight the coronavirus, saying that the restrictions were leading to congestion and stranding thousands of trucks with goods. Earlier this month officials in Guangxi, an autonomous region in southern China, moved to curb rising coronavirus cases by enforcing more stringent border rules, such as extra checkpoints, mass testing and 24-hour security patrols, and suspending border gate operations and fruit imports. Those measures have disrupted supply chains in Vietnam, “adversely impacted the bilateral trade and caused great losses to businesses and people of both sides,” according to the state-run Vietnam News Agency. Vietnamese and Chinese trade officials held talks online and by phone to address the congestion late last month, V.N.A. reported. Vietnamese officials suggested “restoring customs clearance at the border gates and increasing the time for customs clearance,” the agency reported. Guangxi officials said they would ease customs clearance and convey other proposals to more senior officials, according to local news outlets. Fruit exports from Thailand to China — such as durians and longans — have also been held up by the tightened controls at Guangxi, Thai officials said in a statement on Sunday. After urgent talks with Thai officials, the Chinese authorities agreed to open another land checkpoint, the Pingxiang railway crossing in Guangxi, to allow Thai fruit into the country starting Tuesday, according to the Thai Office of Agricultural Affairs at Guangzhou. Drivers, cars and goods must be free of contamination or the Chinese authorities will immediately close the checkpoint again, Thai officials said. More than two million tons of Thai fruit worth $4.4 billion were exported to China from January to October 2021. As a surge of coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant takes a growing toll on live performance, the Public Theater announced recently that it would cancel its Under the Radar festival, originally scheduled to begin on Jan. 12. In a statement, the theater cited “multiple disruptions related to the rapid community spread of the Omicron variant,” including effects on staff availability, cancellations by artists and audience members, flight interruptions and visa processing delays. Mark Russell, the festival’s director, said in a video interview that his team had worked on plans to streamline Under the Radar — the Public’s annual showcase for experimental work, and one of several New York festivals that have formed around the Association of Performing Arts Professionals conference — so that it could proceed despite the surge. But on Thursday morning, Russell said, he took stock of the test positivity rate and number of cases in New York, and decided it would be irresponsible to press on. “It was not a time for a festival,” he said. “A festival is a celebration. It’s supposed to be a coming together to celebrate this work, and it was not going to be a celebration.” New York City is doubling the capacity of its free quarantine hotel program for people with the coronavirus, the agency that runs the program said Monday, after complaints from people who said their attempts to get a room through a city hotline met with endless waits on hold and delays of days for the rooms themselves. A spokesman for the city’s Test and Trace Corps, which runs the quarantine program, said in an email Monday, “We will have nearly a thousand beds available this week, and will continue to scale as needed.” The city has also been dealing with problems in a separate quarantine hotel program for people in homeless shelters after 11 women with the coronavirus were crammed into one room with just a few mattresses on the floor and some chairs. As the number of new virus cases in the city has skyrocketed, the spokesman, Adam Shrier, said that demand for the hotels had “quickly increased due to the rapidly transmissible Omicron variant.” He said that program had “several hundred beds available,” even as “our work force is suffering the same kind of illness and exposure as our other colleagues on the frontlines.” But he declined to say whether there was a wait for rooms, citing agency policy not to “disclose information about our locations or guests to protect their confidentiality.” Nearly 30,000 people have stayed in hotels since the program started in June 2020. The city calls it “the only free, major hotel isolation program in the country.” But four people who tried to take advantage of the main hotel-quarantine system told The New York Times late last week that they had either waited days before getting a room, given up and paid for one themselves, or been stuck on hold for hours on a city hotline without anyone ever picking up. Others posted on Twitter about long waits. Brittny Gaston of Brooklyn, 26, a medical assistant, said that five days after she requested a hotel room and was not given one, she finally spoke to someone, only to be told that she no longer qualified for the program because she no longer needed to quarantine, even though she still had Covid-19 symptoms and two people in her household had underlying health issues. “I really wanted to cry on the phone,” she said, adding that when she had Covid last February, she was able to get a quarantine hotel room without delay. Inside a homeless shelter in Brooklyn last week, meanwhile, 11 women who had tested positive for the virus were crowded into a small room, two of the women said.  One of the women, Anna Ortiz, who has chronic asthma, heart problems and uses a walker, said she had to sleep on an uncarpeted floor without a blanket or pillow. “I felt like I was being treated like an animal,” said Ms. Ortiz, 51. The city Department of Homeless Services described that situation as an “isolated incident” caused by the nonprofit that operates the shelter, Camba. Isaac McGinn, a spokesman for the Department of Homeless Services, said that Camba staff had not followed proper procedure and that the city had “conveyed to providers and staff the proper process for connecting clients who need it to isolation services to prevent this from happening.” He said that the system had abut 160 vacant beds in isolation units for people who are infected and another 210 beds in quarantine rooms for people who were exposed. A 54-year-old public-school science teacher on Long Island was arrested on New Year’s Eve after being accused of giving a teenager an injection of what appeared to be Covid-19 vaccine without his parents’ consent, the Nassau County police said. The police said that the teacher, Laura Parker Russo, administered a shot of what appeared to be a coronavirus vaccine to 17-year-old boy in her house in Sea Cliff, N.Y. The youth later went home and told his mother, who called the police and said she had not authorized the vaccination. Ms. Russo was charged with unauthorized practice of a profession, the police said. She has been removed from her classroom in the Herricks Public Schools system in New Hyde Park and reassigned pending the outcome of the investigation, schools officials said in a statement. A school website, which has been taken down, said Ms. Russo teaches at Herricks High School. Ms. Russo did not respond immediately to an email sent by The New York Times. She was released after her arrest and is scheduled to appear in criminal court on Jan. 21, the police said. Unauthorized practice of a profession is a felony under the state education law that carries a penalty of up to four years in prison. The majority of states, including New York, require parental consent for minors to receive Covid vaccinations. Some parents have prevented their children from getting inoculated for various reasons, including concerns about possible side effects and safety. Scientists say the vaccines are known to be safe for children 5 and older, and they urge vaccinating them because children can both spread the virus to others and become seriously ill themselves. The spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant has led to an increase in pediatric hospitalizations. And because broad immunity cannot be reached unless minors are vaccinated, federal and state officials hope that more parents will vaccinate their children, especially as many students return to school. Daily reports of new coronavirus cases have quadrupled in Nassau County over the past two weeks, according to The New York Times’s tracker. Hospitalizations in the county have risen 47 percent in that time. Seventy-six percent of Nassau County residents are vaccinated, according to The Times’s tracker, and the rate for 12- to 17-year-olds is only slightly lower, at 72 percent, according to state data. There is no statewide Covid vaccine mandate for schoolchildren in New York. But some private schools require vaccination, and New York City requires it for certain sports and extracurricular activities. In September, Los Angeles became the first school district to mandate vaccines for children 12 and older, with a deadline of Jan. 10, but those plans have since been delayed. The Washington, D.C., Council has voted to mandate vaccines for students 16 and older starting March 1. “This is a major source of tension between what is important for public health and what is important in terms of individual liberties and parental autonomy,” said Denis Nash, an epidemiologist at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. Schools require other vaccines for enrollment, like vaccination against measles. “That’s the big question: Does Covid-19 fall into the same category as some of these other vaccine preventable diseases that we do require for school entry, or does it not?” Dr. Nash said. The Biden administration has largely responded to the near vertical rise in coronavirus cases by pushing for more people to get not only their initial doses of vaccine, but booster shots as well. This week, federal health officials endorsed boosters for youths 12 to 17 who had initially gotten the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The government also changed the definition of “up to date” Covid vaccination to include boosters. But even as the United States has moved rapidly to expand who is eligible for boosters, progress in persuading Covid-fatigued Americans to get them has stalled. About 62 percent of Americans — about 206 million people — are fully vaccinated, according to federal data. But according to a C.D.C. database, only about 35 percent of Americans have received a booster since mid-August, when additional shots were first authorized, even as eligibility has greatly expanded. On Nov. 19, the F.D.A. authorized boosters for everyone 18 and older who had received two doses of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, and on Dec. 9, it authorized boosters of the Pfizer vaccine for 16- and 17-year-olds. Those changes led to more Americans getting boosters, according to the federal database, but that has since leveled off. After the discovery of the Omicron variant in late November, the pace of all vaccinations sped up, but it peaked in early December, and then it plateaued. (Reporting lags around the Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s holidays have affected the daily numbers throughout this period.) Omicron, which is highly transmissible, has shown that it is better at evading vaccines than other variants. But scientists say booster shots can offer substantial protection, especially against severe disease. The United States is averaging a staggering 585,000 cases a day, a record and a 247 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are rising more slowly, up 53 percent in the past two weeks, and a smaller percentage of patients are landing in intensive care units or requiring mechanical ventilation, compared with those in previous waves. Deaths are down by 3 percent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention went even further in encouraging booster shots on Wednesday, when health officials recommended that to remain up to date, people should get three doses of Pfizer’s or Moderna’s vaccines. The agency also recommended that recipients of Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose vaccine receive a second dose, preferably of Moderna’s or Pfizer’s. “There really isn’t debate here in what people should do,” the C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, said in an interview on Tuesday. “If they’re eligible for a boost, they should get boosted.” Still, the expansion of booster shot eligibility has not been met with an equal amount of demand. Dr. Rebekah E. Gee, the former health secretary of Louisiana, chalked up the resistance to boosters to pandemic fatigue. Referring to the pandemic’s many problems, Dr. Gee said some people simply “don’t want this to be there” and are trying to “will it out of existence.”"

Today Mr. Finazzo, 35, is in his first semester at Ohio State University. He is getting his second bachelor’s degree, this one in microbiology, hoping to become a research scientist — like the people striving to create a vaccine he watched and read about as he sat on his couch in the pandemic’s earliest, darkest days. “When I saw footage of hospital tents being erected in Central Park, it was like, ‘Wow, life is fragile and precious,’” Mr. Finazzo said, referring to the field hospitals New York City mustered in the spring of 2020. “‘I should probably do something to help out besides make a delicious poison that we like to drink.’” The virus’s toll cannot be overstated: It has stolen over 800,000 American lives, and millions globally. Efforts to thwart it have swept away livelihoods, altered childhoods, and left lasting emotional tolls. At the start of yet another year of Covid-19 in our midst, its latest variant rising, there is for many a sense of familiar foreboding. But all along, in the valley of the shadow of the virus, there has been remarkable resilience. It can be seen in the lightning-fast creation of vaccines that have largely defanged Covid-19, and in recent findings that the methods used now may show promise in the fight against H.I.V. and AIDS. It is in every pivot made by a canny entrepreneur that saved a business, and each government agency that pushed innovative change during chaotic times. And it is in individuals, like Mr. Finazzo, who in the face of seismic societal shifts have not shattered, but shifted too. “The experience of the pandemic has shown we are more resilient than conventional wisdom would suggest,” said George A. Bonanno, a professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University Teachers College and author of “The End of Trauma,” a book about the psychology of human resilience. And while many continue to grapple with grief and trauma, the key to resilient outcomes in the face of disaster is threefold, Dr. Bonanno said: First, distill exactly what is causing distress, then come up with a possible solution. Finally, remain flexible to find a new remedy if that doesn’t work. “I see time and time again that people are resilient,” he said. “The pandemic has shown this in spades.” In the field of medicine, the onslaught of the sick stretched thin hospitals and burned out many medical professionals. But it has also revolutionized some parts of the field, said Dr. Rita A. Manfredi, a clinical professor at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, and a co-author of “The silver linings of COVID-19: Uplifting effects of the pandemic” in “Academic Emergency Medicine,” a medical journal. One example: telemedicine, which officials greatly expanded permissions for during the pandemic, made getting care easier for many people, Dr. Manfredi said. It is likely here to stay. “In any big tragedy, there is always a positive side,” Dr. Manfredi said. “The negative side is obvious, but there is always a positive side.” The coronavirus vaccine itself, made under wartime conditions, may go on to fight other intractable diseases: A study published in December successfully used the same mRNA technology used by the coronavirus vaccine to reduce the infection risk of an H.I.V.-like virus in rhesus macaques — perhaps a glimmer of hope in the fight against AIDS. “This is a promising new finding,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and co-author of the study, said in an interview. “We are infinitely better off now than we were in 2020,” Dr. Fauci continued. “If this were 2020 and we had this kind of a surge of Omicron superimposed upon a Delta surge we would likely have had to shut down the entire country, because we would have no other tools to prevent the spread. Now, we feel we can continue to function as a society.” He added: “Things will get better. It is not going to go on forever.” For some people with disabilities, cultural shifts the pandemic forced, like flexible and remote work — for which they long advocated — have already improved their lives: The employment rate for disabled people is currently at an all-time high, though still profoundly below that of people without disabilities, according to the nonprofit Kessler Foundation, which tracks data that relates to people with disabilities. For Jon Novick, who has achondroplastic dwarfism, office settings can be burdensome. Mr. Novick, 30, said his small stature is not accommodated by standard-issue chairs and desks. Because of his physique, he must get business-professional attire customized, often at an extra expense. In the fall, he got a new job at a Manhattan-based creative agency, but is able to work from his apartment in Astoria, Queens. “I am living in a world that is not quite built for me,” Mr. Novick said. “My perfect office is my home.” The benefit comes alongside frustration for many disabled people like him, that it took a pandemic to make something their community has long pushed for — and was frequently denied — into a norm. “People with disabilities can contribute so much to the work force; we can contribute even more when the playing field is level,” Mr. Novick said. Changed habits forced entire metropolises to change: To give residents of hard-hit New York City space to mingle at a social distance, in May 2020 the city’s Department of Transportation began temporarily closing streets to cars at over 250 locations. The program has faced criticism that the street closures create traffic and take away parking spaces. But for many, the open streets, as they are known, were a welcome new use for the city’s thousands of miles of pavement when they were cooped up at home. The program is now permanent. On 120th Street in Harlem, Tressi Colon, a retired New York Police Department sergeant, helps oversee programming on the open street that includes al fresco community suppers and free lectures from neighbors who work in academia on topics like gentrification. “We were intentional that in the midst of this pandemic that something good will come out of it,” Ms. Colon said. “That was the key.” Across many industries, necessity forced norms to change, often for the better. In the fashion world, where resale was once a synonym for used or unwanted clothing and unsold merchandise sometimes burned, the clogging of supply chains and growing conversation around sustainability caused some designers to reuse fabrics long abandoned on storeroom shelves. Burberry, for example, which before the pandemic got in trouble when it was revealed in 2018 that it incinerated approximately $37 million of unsold product, has now partnered with a luxury rental and resale platform to put its stamp of approval on older garments and accessories sourced from customers, rather than lose them to the secondhand market or let them be thrown away. For her spring 2022 collection, the French designer Marine Serre, a champion of upcycling, made old tabletop linens, toweling and even cutlery into neat suiting and jewelry that was one of the hits of Paris Fashion Week. Book sales rose during the pandemic’s first year of lockdown, but today, even with schools open and more options for entertainment, reading habits seem to have stuck: From January to November 2021, sales of consumer books increased 13 percent over the same period the year before, according to the Association of American Publishers. At least 172 new independent bookstores opened in 2021, the American Booksellers Association said. When Jason Innocent was furloughed from his job as a restaurant kitchen manager, he began to read for pleasure for the first time in his adult life, powering through “1984,” “Macbeth,” “A Raisin in the Sun” and more. Now back at work, he kept the habit — plus practicing new words he reads. A few days before the New Year, Mr. Innocent, 26, stood in a line in downtown Manhattan waiting for a coronavirus test, studying vocabulary. “A lot of people, the pandemic made them upset, but I took a bad situation and turned it into a positive,” Mr. Innocent said, flicking through his vocabulary list. “Even if another shutdown happened, I’m going to find a way to survive.” After watching a television segment on new technology to sterilize N95 masks to combat a national shortage, Mr. Finazzo, the former brewery worker, applied for a job with the company. The satisfaction of helping out cemented his growing interest in a career in science. “I was thinking to myself: Would I want to go and tell my kids or grandkids that I survived the Covid pandemic of 2020 by sitting alone in my apartment getting drunk?” Mr. Finazzo said. “Or did I want to go and utilize this opportunity to be able to help people?”"

Many people had hoped to be heading into work, some for the first time in nearly two years. Brooks Brothers had sent out a promotional email about how to “look great at the office.” But workers across the country remained home, with little idea when they might see their offices again. With Covid case counts soaring, fueled by the highly contagious Omicron variant, businesses are once again weighing when to reopen, and what steps they need to take to do so safely. In recent days, Jefferies, Goldman Sachs, Chevron and many more employers have delayed or changed their January return-to-office plans. Starbucks, Delta Air Lines and BlackRock have amended their Covid safety protocols, responding to shifting guidance from public health authorities. At Jefferies, the investment bank, a memo to the staff on Monday morning from Rich Handler, the chief executive, and Brian Friedman, the president, announced a new plan: “Realistically, we do not foresee us all having a safe opportunity to be together in our offices until at least Monday, January 31st.” The executives added a dose of optimism: “While nobody knows for sure, we believe (and fervently hope) this could be the last truly challenging period of this pandemic.” The memo reflected a view, shared by some business leaders, that the spread of the Omicron variant — which is more infectious, but also more mild, especially for the vaccinated — could usher in the endemic phase of the pandemic, and with it a wave of office reopenings that might actually be executed. Other companies are devising new ways to keep their workplaces open. Starbucks announced on Monday that it would reduce the number of days that vaccinated, asymptomatic workers who test positive must isolate, to five days from 10, following the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The company also said U.S. workers would have to be fully vaccinated by Feb. 9 or submit to weekly testing, in compliance with a Biden administration vaccine rule for large employers. A spokesman for Starbucks said the company gave store and district managers some leeway to decide when specific locations need to make adjustments, like opening for drive-through orders only. “Our retail leaders are empowered to modify operations locally,” said Reggie Borges, the company spokesman. “They’re able to make those adjustments on the fly.” CNN, which had earlier planned a January return for some employees, confirmed to its staff in an email on Sunday that its offices would remain closed except to “those who absolutely need to be there.” Goldman Sachs told U.S. employees on Sunday to work from home until Jan. 18. The investment bank, which called most of its staff back to the office in June, had announced just last week that it would increase its vaccination and testing requirements, even as its Wall Street rivals were returning to remote work. More changes could be coming soon as guidance from public health authorities continues to shift and the administration pushes to keep the economy running. Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Sunday that the C.D.C. was considering recommending that Americans test negative for the coronavirus before leaving isolation, updating a policy change it made just last month. For companies like Delta, that might mean once again altering protocols. For others, that may invite an intense set of negotiations with unions. On Friday, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments over the legality of the Biden administration’s mandate for large employers to require vaccinations or weekly testing. Meanwhile, the very meaning of “fully vaccinated” may soon change. Marcia St. Hilaire-Finn, who runs Bright Start Early Care and Preschool in Washington, D.C., said she recently changed her coronavirus polices and approach, responding to both news about Omicron and new C.D.C. guidance. Previously if an employee or child tested positive, she closed their classroom for 10 days. Now she requires vaccinated asymptomatic employees with Covid to isolate for just five days, though classroom closures last longer because the children are not vaccinated. Over the holidays, Ms. St. Hilaire-Finn offered a $100 bonus to any employee who got a booster shot. She estimates that every staff member will have received a booster shot by the end of this week. “At this point we’re leaning more towards being open than closed,” she said. George Colony, the chief executive of Forrester Research, a consulting firm in Boston, said last month that he was once again pushing back his company’s office return. “We expected to open our U.S. offices in early January,” he said. “That timetable is not going to happen. We are going to stay remote.” Mr. Colony said he was preparing for some Forrester employees to be out of commission in the weeks ahead. “I think many of us are going to get sick here in the next few months,” he said. “I expect more people will be absent, more people will be sick.” When to bring those recovered workers back will be a new challenge. If the C.D.C. recommends that infected workers test negative before returning to work — as many scientists have urged it to do — companies will have to figure out how to supply in-demand tests to employees. While big companies have been buying tests in bulk, smaller employers often do not have that capacity. Deciding whom to prioritize for tests, who pays for them and how to verify the results will bedevil boardrooms in the coming months. Some firms have already begun to incorporate testing into their plans. BlackRock, the asset management firm, told its roughly 7,600 U.S. employees before the holidays that it was “encouraging flexibility” and requiring those who continue to go into the office to be tested weekly. Last week, it announced it would extend that policy through Jan. 28. Whether deciding when to open offices or setting policies for isolation, employers are grappling with a key question: How much risk of exposure and spread are they and their workers willing to tolerate? They don’t all agree. This week, Dr. Brian Monahan, the attending physician for Congress, advised all congressional offices, committees and agencies to maximize remote work and reduce in-person meetings as much as possible, though this is a recommendation. “While some view the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease as ‘endemic,’ the ‘new normal,’ and ‘inevitable,’ these views are premature,” Dr. Monahan wrote in a memo reviewed by The New York Times. “The entire community must continue to take every measure to suppress the rapid spread of this disease.”"
170,The New York Times,nytimes,"Winter break is over in most parts of the U.S., which means schools are reopening — or they’re not.",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3sSr9Kr%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR12TqbaTI52AVGjXuhhRbiI8jMHWZulsXhM2aoHK1Acj2OxRzXBvUeR3IA&h=AT0MnoO4c2uEbNU9ehX3ccdAIyTklttgSA1LbbFjSgPbbqxczprznnV4arZ6tONSPyPV4p7wPc6b9VHQ5sQ2fqNL_TiasG1TSV2DuW6EsF60Ns7kVI6ABGP9DqwD8g_NxTEStA9nAh0AopaKrLr4&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT3E2nfIqv2lkM8Auf0dFDkV72ais0DiazLpOCXTFY0GviIex0iEqNqicEL3RtHYz-FTWHc7_MvwBy5w5FvBpOXh6IioY9yFeeUk16XBCVimA04dNGqNYBMwetrfwqxvMLPwlLZIU7Vi8srsD-uxL7RX7pr820zSgc8RZq4N4ACV2I8Q,2d,"The Omicron surge threatens to upend any sense of peace in the nation’s education system. After a holiday break that saw Covid-19 cases spike unrelentingly, a small but growing list of districts — including Newark, Atlanta, Milwaukee and Cleveland — moved temporarily to remote learning for more than 450,000 children. Districtwide closures, even those that last for a week or two, are a step backward after months in which classrooms largely remained open, even during a fall surge of the Delta variant. And although politicians, including Mayor Eric Adams of New York and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, vowed to keep schools open, there were growing fears from parents and educators that more districts would soon turn to remote learning — even though in-school transmission of Covid-19 has been limited. Those decisions could, in turn, radiate through the country, affecting child care, employment and any confidence that the pandemic’s viselike grip was loosening. “It’s chaos,” said Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, which has polled families throughout the pandemic. “The No. 1 thing that parents and families are crying out for is stability.” Some families were given just a few days or even hours of notice about school closures, leading to the all-too-familiar pandemic scramble to adjust child-care arrangements and work schedules. Atlanta Public Schools, for instance, announced on Saturday that classes would be online for the first week of January, just days after saying that classes would be held in person. Ms. Rodrigues’s own sons were home on Monday morning after their schools, in Somerville, Mass., announced on Saturday a two-hour delayed start to test staff and distribute KN95 masks. The continued burden on parents nationwide is unacceptable, Ms. Rodrigues said, given that a winter surge of the virus was predictable and that policymakers had months to secure and distribute tests and masks. “No grace is extended to us,” she said of parents who would have to go out to work, whether or not their children’s schools were open. The academic, social and emotional toll of school closures has been enormous, and well-documented. During the first year of the pandemic, before vaccines were available, the question of whether children should be in classrooms was one of the most divisive in American life. Today, politicians, labor leaders and teachers overwhelmingly say they want classrooms to remain open. A vast majority of the nation’s school districts — including most of the largest ones — appear to be operating relatively normally. Still, the closures this week appeared to be concentrated in regions, such as the Northeast and upper Midwest, where Democratic Party policymakers and teachers’ unions have taken a more cautious approach to operating schools throughout the pandemic. The nation is averaging more than 400,000 new cases a day for the first time in the pandemic, though hospitalizations are growing at a much slower rate. Many principals have reported large numbers of staff members calling in sick, because they are infected with Covid-19 or other illnesses, caring for sick family members or fearful of the conditions within school buildings. Several of the shuttered districts serve predominantly Black, Hispanic and low-income students, raising concerns about the educational gaps that widened during previous phases of the pandemic. “There is a casualness with which some have approached closing schools that I find deeply concerning, precisely because of the severe harms we’ve seen accumulate over the past year when schools were closed,” said Joseph Allen, a Harvard University professor who studies indoor environmental quality, including in schools. Still, in New York City, where schools were open, about a third of the students did not show up, suggesting significant parental hesitation. And there are signs that some unions are becoming more resistant to in-person teaching. Members of the Chicago Teachers Union are preparing to vote on Tuesday on whether to refuse to report to schools starting the following day. The union, which has repeatedly clashed with Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration, had demanded that every student be tested for the virus before returning from winter break, a step the district did not take. The district, one of the largest in the country, instead gave tens of thousands of students optional take-home P.C.R. tests before winter break, which parents were supposed to bring to a FedEx drop box. On Monday, it became clear that the testing effort had largely failed. Of 35,590 tests recorded by the district in the week ending Saturday, 24,843 had invalid results. Among the minority of tests that did produce results, 18 percent were positive. A district official said test vendors were looking into the reasons for the inconclusive results. At a news conference on Monday, the union’s vice president, Stacy Davis Gates, expressed her anger at having “to continuously fight for the basic necessities, the basic mitigations.” In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis reiterated on Monday that officials would not allow the state’s public schools to close, despite a major spike in coronavirus cases. “You have worse outcomes by closing schools,” said Mr. DeSantis, a Republican who has increased his national profile by rejecting coronavirus lockdowns and mandates for much of the pandemic. “Kids need to be in school.” Furthermore, Mr. DeSantis said, children “do not need to be doing any crazy mitigation” such as testing or wearing masks, unless their parents want them to. He added: “Just let them be kids.” In the New York area, there was a growing divide between the city, where nearly all schools opened on Monday morning with beefed-up virus testing protocols, and the surrounding region, where a growing list of smaller districts shifted to remote learning, generally citing the surging number of Covid-19 cases within the community — not specific instances of in-school spread of the virus. The school board president in Newark, Dawn Haynes, said in a statement, “The lives of all of our students mean more to me than anything else, especially since three of them are actually mine.” In New Rochelle, N.Y., the school superintendent, Jonathan P. Raymond, wrote in a Dec. 31 letter that a week of remote learning would allow the district to await a shipment of rapid tests from the state, and sign up more students for in-school surveillance testing. Some schools announcing their decision to temporarily close cited the closing of other districts — adding to an uneasy sense of falling dominoes. When the superintendent in Mt. Vernon, N.Y., announced a two-week period of remote learning, he pointed to the closure of some schools in Maryland, where, on Dec. 17, Prince George’s County became the first major district to announce an extended shift to virtual teaching. While Omicron is more contagious than previous iterations of the virus, early indications are that it is also less severe. Dr. Allen, from Harvard, said the existing recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still allowed schools to operate safely, especially because children were at such low risk of serious complications from Covid-19. Those measures include vaccination, masking, handwashing, the use of portable air filters and cracking windows. On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine boosters for 12- to 15-year-olds, but child and teenage vaccination rates have been disappointing in many places. The C.D.C. also recommends a strategy called test to stay, in which close contacts of positive virus cases are given frequent rapid tests; only those who test positive must stay home. But many schools still lack the number of rapid antigen tests they need. Dr. Allen acknowledged that rapid tests were in short supply. “We’ve been calling for rapid testing for a year and a half,” he said. “I find it stunning that the country has so failed to prioritize kids.” Still, many parents said that despite the difficulties of closures, they trusted their children’s schools to make the right call. Lorenzo Spencer, whose son is a freshman at Cass Technical High School in Detroit, said he was not surprised by the district’s announcement of a three-day closure — without remote learning — to test its 8,000 employees. “There’s no playbook for what we’re going through,” Mr. Spencer said. “As long as they’re doing what they can do to stay safe, I’m all for it.”"

The agreement was made public as part of a lawsuit filed by the woman, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, against Prince Andrew, who was friendly with Mr. Epstein and who Ms. Giuffre has said raped her when she was 17.  Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, has denied Ms. Giuffre’s allegations, and his lawyers are expected to argue at a hearing on Tuesday that her suit, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan, should be dismissed. Andrew B. Brettler, a lawyer for Prince Andrew, declined to comment on the terms of the 2009 settlement or its potential ramifications for Ms. Giuffre’s lawsuit against his client. Ms. Giuffre says in the suit that she was trafficked and abused by Mr. Epstein and others in his circle, including Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, starting when she was 16.  The prince, 61, was a friend of Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite and longtime companion of Mr. Epstein’s who was convicted last week of conspiring with him to recruit, groom and sexually abuse underage girls.  Ms. Giuffre’s suit against Prince Andrew, which seeks unspecified damages, accuses him of abusing her “at Epstein and Maxwell’s invitation” in New York. She says the prince also abused her in London and on an island Mr. Epstein owned in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Ms. Giuffre did not testify at Ms. Maxwell’s trial. Prince Andrew’s lawyers have argued that Ms. Giuffre’s suit against him is invalid, in part because of her 2009 settlement with Mr. Epstein. In addition to the sum she received, the filing unsealed on Monday shows her agreeing to drop claims against Mr. Epstein and anyone else “who could have been included as a potential defendant.”  In a statement on Monday, David Boies, a lawyer for Ms. Giuffre, said the details of the 2009 agreement were “irrelevant to Ms. Giuffre’s claim against Prince Andrew.” The settlement, Mr. Boies said, did not mention the prince by name and he “did not even know about it.”  Prince Andrew “could not have been a ‘potential defendant’ in the settled case against Jeffrey Epstein both because he was not subject to jurisdiction in Florida and because the Florida case involved federal claims to which he was not a part,” Mr. Boies said. Mr. Boies said that he and Ms. Giuffre’s other lawyers had sought the public release of the settlement filing to rebut claims made by Prince Andrew’s legal team. The prince’s lawyers have argued that Ms. Giuffre was seeking a “payday” by suing him.  A fund created by Mr. Epstein’s estate to compensate his victims has paid out at least $121 million to more than 135 people. Ms. Giuffre, who now runs a nonprofit group called Speak Out, Act, Reclaim, filed her suit against Prince Andrew almost exactly two years after Mr. Epstein killed himself in a federal jail in Manhattan while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges. He had been accused of sexually exploiting dozens of women and girls at his various homes.  Prince Andrew had stepped back from public life in 2019 after a disastrous interview with the BBC about his links to Mr. Epstein. Ms. Giuffre’s suit, which included a picture of her and the prince together, undermined his assertion in the interview that he could not recall meeting her.  The continuing questions about Prince Andrew’s conduct come at a difficult time for Britain’s royal family, which has endured a public rift within its ranks and is confronting worries about the health of Queen Elizabeth, 95, after the 2021 death of her husband, Prince Philip. Britain’s tabloid newspapers have seized on tensions within the royal household that were exposed in a series of interviews in which Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, described royal life as a kind of gilded prison and said that family members held retrograde views on race. Toward the end of last year, the queen canceled some engagements because of concerns over her health, but she did deliver her annual televised Christmas message. She made no mention of either Prince Harry’s decision to step down from duties as a senior member of the royal family or Prince Andrew’s legal battle.    "
172,The New York Times,nytimes,"Many more people, including those who have been vaccinated against Covid, will test positive for the coronavirus as the Omicron variant spreads. So what should you do if you’re one of them? Here's what physicians and infectious disease experts say.",https://nyti.ms/3HyTg5u?fbclid=IwAR2wxduzr45qeQqk6P6qP4FQn8n6gtn57KHzQsvoC6W0mSI0UX3TyokrYk4,2d,"SAN JOSE, Calif. — Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the failed blood testing start-up Theranos, was found guilty of four of 11 charges of fraud on Monday, in a case that came to symbolize the pitfalls of Silicon Valley’s culture of hustle, hype and greed. Ms. Holmes, who had once promised to revolutionize health care, was the most prominent executive to field fraud accusations in a generation of high-flying, money-losing start-ups. A jury of eight men and four women took 50 hours over seven days of deliberations to reach a verdict, convicting her of three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud by lying to investors to raise money for her company. Ms. Holmes was found not guilty on four other counts related to defrauding patients who had used Theranos’s blood tests. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on three counts of deceiving investors, for which Judge Edward J. Davila of California’s Northern District said he planned to declare a mistrial. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, terms that are likely to be served concurrently. Ms. Holmes, 37, is expected to appeal. A sentencing date is expected to be set at a hearing on the three hung charges next week. While the verdict was read, Ms. Holmes — who had falsely claimed that Theranos’s blood tests could detect a variety of ailments with just a few drops of blood — sat motionless. Then she gathered her belongings and whispered to her lawyer. She went down the row of family and friends in the court gallery behind her, hugging each one before leaving through a side door. “It’s been a long case,” Judge Davila told the jury. “We collectively have been through many things.” Stephanie Hinds, a U.S. attorney, said in a statement that the guilty verdicts reflected Ms. Holmes’s “culpability in this large-scale investor fraud.” The verdict stands out for its rarity. Few technology executives are charged with fraud and even fewer are convicted. If sentenced to prison, Ms. Holmes would be the most notable female executive to serve time since Martha Stewart did in 2004 after lying to investigators about a stock sale. And Theranos, which dissolved in 2018, is likely to stand as a warning to other Silicon Valley start-ups that stretch the truth to score funding and business deals. The mixed verdict suggested that jurors believed the evidence presented by prosecutors that showed Ms. Holmes lied to investors about Theranos’s technology in the pursuit of money and fame. They were not swayed by her defense of blaming others for Theranos’s problems and accusing her co-conspirator, Ramesh Balwani, the company’s chief operating officer and her former boyfriend, of abusing her. They were also not swayed by the prosecutor’s case that she had defrauded patients. On Monday, jurors told the court that they were deadlocked on three of the charges of defrauding investors. Judge Davila pushed them to continue deliberating, but they were unable to agree. The verdict arrived in a frenzied period for the tech industry, with investors fighting to get into hot deals and often ignoring potential red flags about the companies they were putting money into. Some have warned that more Theranos-like disasters loom. In recent years, tales of start-up chicanery, from the bungled initial public offering of WeWork to the aggressive boundary-pushing tactics of Uber, have not slowed the flow of money toward charismatic founders spinning tales of business success. Those downfalls captured the public’s attention, but did not result in criminal charges. Yet the Justice Department under President Biden has renewed its focus on white-collar crimes. “We will urge prosecutors to be bold,” Lisa O. Monaco, the deputy attorney general, recently said in a speech. “The fear of losing should not deter them.” Ms. Holmes’s conviction sends a message to other founders and executives to be careful about their statements to investors and the public, said Jessica Roth, a law professor at Cardozo School of Law and former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. It “shines a light on the importance of drawing a distinction between truth and optimistic projections — and keeping that clear in one’s mind,” she said. Ms. Holmes rose to prominence by mimicking the disruptive change-the-world chutzpah of Silicon Valley heroes like Steve Jobs — a playbook that has turned companies like Apple, Tesla, Google and Facebook into some of the most valuable in the world. In the process, she captured the attention of heads of state, top business leaders and wealthy families with idealistic plans to revolutionize the health care industry. She traveled the world on private jets, was feted with awards and glowing magazine cover stories and lauded as the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire. But she crossed into fraud when she lied about the accuracy, types and number of tests Theranos’s machines could do to raise funding and secure business deals. “That’s a crime on Main Street and it’s a crime in Silicon Valley,” Robert Leach, an assistant U.S. attorney, said in opening statements at the trial’s start. The verdict concludes nearly four months of proceedings that alternated between exhilarating and plodding. There were delays because of a coronavirus scare, a burst water pipeline, technology problems in the courtroom and juror travel. One juror was dismissed for playing Sudoku and another for her Buddhist faith. Crowds of spectators, many of whom followed the Theranos saga via podcasts, documentaries, books and news articles, waited for hours for a spot in the courtroom’s limited seats. Inside, jurors heard from dozens of witnesses and viewed hundreds of pieces of evidence used in support of prosecutors’ argument that Ms. Holmes knowingly misled investors and patients on her rise to fame and fortune. Witnesses included James Mattis, the former defense secretary who sat on Theranos’s board, as well as Lisa Peterson, who managed money for the wealthy family of a former education secretary, Betsy DeVos, and invested $100 million in Theranos. Prominent investors including Rupert Murdoch and Larry Ellison, as well as two former secretaries of state, George Shultz and Henry Kissinger, who sat on its board, were discussed but never called to the stand. The case’s evidence outlined Ms. Holmes’s role in faked demonstrations, falsified validation reports, misleading claims about contracts, and overstated financials at Theranos. Jurors heard recordings and watched videos of Ms. Holmes making inflated or misleading claims about Theranos. Before it shut down in 2018, Theranos voided two years’ worth of its blood tests. It paid to settle several investor lawsuits, as well as fraud charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission. But prosecutors argued that Ms. Holmes’s actions went beyond those punishments — they were criminal. She led investors to lose hundreds of millions of dollars and patients to get unreliable test results, they said. “At so many of the forks in the road, she chose the dishonest path,” John Bostic, an assistant U.S. attorney, said in closing arguments. In her defense, Ms. Holmes’s lawyers tried to discredit testimony from whistle-blowers, attacked investors for not doing more research into Theranos and said Ms. Holmes’s failures were not a crime. Ms. Holmes capped the proceedings by taking the stand. Over seven days of testimony, she alternated between accepting responsibility for certain missteps and deflecting blame for other problems to colleagues. She said she believed that Theranos’s tests worked and had relied on the expertise of more qualified people running the company’s lab. And she used her charisma to sell jurors on the same vision of the future that, years earlier, had helped her win over investors, world leaders and the press. “I wanted to talk about what this company could do a year from now, five years from now, 10 years from now,” Ms. Holmes said. “I wanted to talk about what was possible.” Ms. Holmes’s argument that her optimistic projections were no different than that of other Silicon Valley companies contradicted the government’s evidence, which was consistent with traditional fraud cases, Ms. Roth said. “If other founders and executives are engaged in the kinds of deceit that was alleged and proven by considerable evidence in this case, then they should be concerned,” she said. Most strikingly, Ms. Holmes accused Mr. Balwani of emotional and sexual abuse. The pair dated in secret for more than a decade, even owning an estate in Atherton, Calif., together. Ms. Holmes said Mr. Balwani, who is around 20 years older, controlled every aspect of her life, including her schedule, self-presentation and time spent with her family. She also accused him of forcing her to have sex with him. Mr. Balwani has denied the allegations. That testimony, delivered through tears, threatened to turn the tide against the prosecutor’s case by appealing to the jury’s emotions and painting Ms. Holmes as a victim. But it was a risky strategy, experts have said, particularly since Ms. Holmes did not provide an expert witness to put her accusations in context of the wire fraud charges. Mr. Balwani, known as Sunny, will stand trial this year. He has also pleaded not guilty. Ms. Holmes left the courthouse after dark on Monday, holding hands with her mother and partner. Cameras surrounded them, lighting up the dark sidewalk. As reporters shouted questions, Ms. Holmes avoided eye contact and stared straight ahead. The fraud trial of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the failed blood testing start-up Theranos, began with jury selection on Aug. 31 and opening statements on Sept. 8. In the weeks that followed, jurors heard from 32 witnesses, including Ms. Holmes, in proceedings that featured dramatic allegations of abuse and long days discussing scientific terminology. Here were three of the key moments from the trial. On Oct. 12, prosecutors showed a key piece of evidence: Theranos’s technology validation reports, which bore the logos of the pharmaceutical companies Pfizer, Schering-Plough and GlaxoSmithKline. Theranos had used the reports to solicit investors and woo commercial partners, even though the drug companies had neither prepared nor approved the reports. Prosecutors repeatedly pointed to the documents as a clear-cut example of fraud. On Nov. 23, Ms. Holmes, 37, said on the stand that she had added the logos to the reports. It was the first time she acknowledged any personal involvement in the documents. But Ms. Holmes said she had not intended to deceive anyone. She said that she added the logos to the reports “because this work was done in partnership with those companies and I was trying to convey that.” Ms. Holmes teared up and her voice shook as she accused Ramesh Balwani, Theranos’s former chief operating officer and her ex-boyfriend, of emotional and physical abuse in her testimony on Nov. 29. The bombshell accusations came at the end of her direct examination. Ms. Holmes said Mr. Balwani, who is 20 years older than her, controlled her schedule, criticized her mannerisms and forced her to have sex with him. Mr. Balwani, who faces his own fraud trial next year and has pleaded not guilty, has denied the accusations. Ms. Holmes also testified that Mr. Balwani did not control her interactions with investors, journalists or executives. But, she said, “he impacted everything about who I was, and I don’t fully understand that.” Prosecutors later told jurors to put the abuse accusations out of their minds and focus on the fraud charges instead. “The case is about false statements made to investors and false statements made to patients,” Jeff Schenk, an assistant U.S. attorney and a lead prosecutor, said. “You do not need to question whether that abuse happened.” For Ms. Holmes, everything came down to how the jury interpreted her intent. During prosecutors’ closing argument on Dec. 16, Mr. Schenk argued that Ms. Holmes deliberately deceived investors, patients and advertisers with the pharmaceutical validation reports, faked technology demonstrations and inaccurate marketing materials. ​​“She chose fraud over business failure,” Mr. Schenk said. But Kevin Downey, a lawyer for Ms. Holmes, countered in the defense’s closing argument that she had acted in good faith. He said that Ms. Holmes had believed her employees’ positive feedback about Theranos’s technology, that investors had known their bets were risky and that her statements had been misunderstood. “She believed she was building a technology that would change the world,” Mr. Downey said. Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the failed blood testing start-up Theranos, now awaits sentencing after being found guilty of four of 11 charges of fraud on Monday. Ms. Holmes, 37, left the San Jose, Calif., courtroom through a side door after the verdict was read in the case, which was closely scrutinized as a commentary on Silicon Valley. She was found guilty of three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She was found not guilty on four other counts. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on three counts, which were set aside for later. After the verdict was read, defense and prosecution lawyers discussed plans for Ms. Holmes’s sentencing, the status of her release and the fate of the three hung charges. Judge Edward J. Davila of the Northern District of California, who oversaw the case, said he planned to declare a mistrial on those charges, which the government could choose to retry. The parties agreed that Ms. Holmes would not be taken into custody on Monday. A sentencing date is expected to be set at a hearing on the three hung charges next week. Ms. Holmes can appeal the conviction, her sentence or both. She will also be interviewed by the U.S. Probation Office as it prepares a pre-sentence report. A conference will be held next week on the three counts in which the jury could not reach a verdict.  Each count of wire fraud carries up to 20 years in prison, though Ms. Holmes is unlikely to receive the maximum sentence because she has no prior convictions, said Neama Rahmani, the president of the West Coast Trial Lawyers and a former federal prosecutor. But he said her sentence was likely to be on the higher end because of the amount of the money involved. Ms. Holmes raised $945 million for Theranos during the start-up’s lifetime and those investments were ultimately wiped out. Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the blood testing start-up Theranos, faced 11 counts of fraud for lying to investors, patients and others to raise money and the profile for her company. (An additional charge of wire fraud against a patient was dropped during the trial.) Here’s what jurors decided: For years, the blood testing start-up Theranos was a darling of Silicon Valley. Its founder, Elizabeth Holmes, started the company in 2003, dropping out of Stanford a year later. The promise of Theranos was simple: The start-up would revolutionize health care with cheaper, easier blood tests that took only a few drops of blood to diagnose conditions as varied as prostate cancer and pregnancy. Based on that promise, Ms. Holmes raised $945 million from investors and Theranos signed partnerships with Walgreens and Safeway. At its peak, Theranos was valued at $9 billion. That made Ms. Holmes, who owned a substantial portion of the company, a billionaire on paper. Then in 2015, The Wall Street Journal revealed that Theranos relied on third-party machines for many of its blood tests rather than using its own technology. The implication: Theranos was built atop wildly misleading claims. At first, Ms. Holmes stuck by Theranos. She went on “Mad Money” on CNBC in 2015 and told the host Jim Cramer: “First they think you’re crazy, then they fight you, then you change the world.” But in January 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, notified Theranos that a November 2015 lab inspection had uncovered “deficient practices” that posed “immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety.” In June 2016, Walgreens ended its Theranos partnership, suing the company for $140 million and eventually voiding two years of blood tests. In 2018, Ms. Holmes settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission over fraud charges. She was then indicted by the federal government on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Later that year, with Ms. Holmes no longer at the helm, Theranos officially shut down. As Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the blood testing start-up Theranos, arrived in court for each day of her fraud trial, she was accompanied by an entourage of supporters, including family members and former sorority sisters from her time at Stanford University. Along with her mother, Noel Holmes, another person was a consistent presence for Ms. Holmes at the trial: Billy Evans, her partner. Mr. Evans’s family founded the Evans Hotel Group, a hotel chain in Southern California. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2015 and worked at a tech start-up until early 2019, according to his public LinkedIn page. Not much is publicly known about Ms. Holmes’s relationship with Mr. Evans. The two were first seen together at the Burning Man festival in 2018, the year that Theranos shut down. Mr. Evans and Ms. Holmes, 37, had a child together in July; she often toted a diaper bag in court. Mr. Evans often sat with the rest of Ms. Holmes’s family in their reserved row in the courtroom in San Jose, Calif., occasionally leaning over to confer with Noel Holmes during testimony. He and the other members of Ms. Holmes’s entourage kept to themselves and did not interact with the press or the public. He has declined to comment on the trial. It was Silicon Valley’s trial of the decade. Since opening statements began on Sept. 8, Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the failed blood testing start-up Theranos, has been standing trial in federal court in San Jose, Calif., for 11 counts of fraud (a 12th count was removed). She was found guilty on four counts. Her case has captivated the public — and spawned books, documentaries and even a fan club for Ms. Holmes, 37 — because she was a young female entrepreneur in heavily male Silicon Valley and because she appeared to push the boundaries of start-up culture and hubris to the limit. Her story initially seemed like the stuff dreams are made of. Ms. Holmes dropped out of Stanford University at 19 and founded Theranos, which promised to decipher people’s health problems with just a drop of their blood. The company raised $945 million from famous venture capitalists and from powerful tech and media moguls such as Larry Ellison and Rupert Murdoch. At its peak, Theranos was valued at $9 billion. Ms. Holmes was lauded as one of the youngest self-made female billionaires. But it all came crashing down after a 2015 investigation from The Wall Street Journal found that Theranos’s blood-testing technology didn’t work. Theranos shut down in 2018. Ms. Holmes was on trial over a central issue: Did she intentionally mislead doctors, patients and investors as she sought investments and partnerships? The prosecution spent weeks arguing that she purposely deceived investors and others while knowing that Theranos’s blood tests were often inaccurate and that the company relied on third-party commercial machines. In opening statements, Ms. Holmes’s lawyers asserted that she was simply a hardworking entrepreneur whose failure to achieve lofty aims did not constitute a crime. Ms. Holmes vocally defended herself in the media after The Wall Street Journal’s revelations about Theranos. She continued that stance during her testimony in court. The trial played out inside a courtroom presided over by Judge Edward J. Davila of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, with no live broadcast of the proceedings. After more than three months of testimony, a jury of eight men and four women has decided the fate of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the failed blood testing start-up Theranos, who faces 11 counts of fraud. The jury was chosen over three days in September when nearly 200 Northern California residents were winnowed down into a pool of 12 jurors and five alternates. Given the prominence of this case, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a difficult time selecting an impartial jury. Potential jurors were quizzed about their familiarity with Theranos and its rise and fall, which had been widely covered by the news media and had spawned a book, a documentary and two podcasts. One potential juror, who was a producer at a radio news show, was excused because his job exposed him to the news, while another was excused for having seen a Theranos documentary. Lawyers also screened out jurors whose experiences with domestic abuse could sway their view of Ms. Holmes’s case. The defense had indicated in pretrial filings that Ms. Holmes would accuse Ramesh Balwani, Theranos’s former chief operating officer and her former boyfriend, of emotionally and physically abusing her. The final jury was made up of seven men and five women. But once the trial began, that composition changed. One juror was excused on the second day of the trial because she was not able to change her work schedule. Another was excused in the fifth week because she said her Buddhist faith would not allow her to vote to convict Ms. Holmes. A third was excused after another juror reported her for playing Sudoku while the court was in session. All three dismissals were women. That left the jury at eight men and four women. The largely male composition could work in Ms. Holmes’s favor, legal experts said. That dynamic may be compounded by Ms. Holmes’s testimony of domestic abuse, the experts said. “Women tend to be more judgmental of other women,” said Christina Marinakis, a jury consulting adviser at the trial services firm IMS Consulting & Expert Services. “The men, especially given her age and young appearance, may take more of a fatherly approach.” For seven days, Elizabeth Holmes took the stand to defend herself. Nearly three months into her fraud trial, Ms. Holmes, the founder of the blood testing start-up Theranos, got the chance to testify, starting on Nov. 19. Her defense boiled down to two major themes: Her actions were misunderstood, she said. Others around her — most notably Ramesh Balwani, Theranos’s former chief operating officer and her former boyfriend — were responsible for the company’s failure, she said. And finally, she implied, just because Theranos failed did not mean she had committed fraud. Ms. Holmes’s testimony was among the first times she had told her side of the story about Theranos’s rise and fall. The Silicon Valley company raised $945 million from investors by touting supposedly revolutionary blood-testing technology, but collapsed after those claims were shown to be false. Ms. Holmes, 37, was charged with 11 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She was found guilty on four of the charges. Under direct examination, Ms. Holmes reframed what prosecutors had said were examples of fraud. She said she had personally added the logos of pharmaceutical companies to reports that seemingly validated Theranos’s devices, when in reality the drug makers had recommended against using Theranos’s technology. But she said she had added the logos “because this work was done in partnership with those companies” and had not tried to deceive anyone. She also said she had concealed Theranos’s use of third-party blood-testing devices — but to protect the modifications her company had made to them, so other companies could not copy them. Ms. Holmes also blamed others for Theranos’s problems. She said others had overseen Theranos’s clinical lab and its commercial partnerships. She highlighted positive reports from her senior scientists, saying she had thought the devices “performed well.” Ms. Holmes could not have deceived others about the technology’s shortcomings because she herself believed it worked, her lawyers implied. She especially pointed the finger at one person: Mr. Balwani, who faces trial on similar charges later this year. Ms. Holmes said he had emotionally and physically abused her during their decade-long secret relationship, allegations that he has denied. Ms. Holmes said he had controlled her schedule and diet, kept her from her family and forced her to have sex. Ms. Holmes conceded that Mr. Balwani had not controlled her interactions with investors or others she is accused of defrauding, but said his influence over her had been so deep that she did not know how to quantify it. “He impacted everything about who I was, and I don’t fully understand that,” she said. Who is Sunny Balwani, Elizabeth Holmes’s former right hand at Theranos and her former boyfriend? In her testimony, Ms. Holmes has accused Mr. Balwani of emotionally abusing her and controlling her, suggesting that she was manipulated. Very little is known of Mr. Balwani, including why he is called “Sunny.” His given name is Ramesh, which was what he was called in a handful of stories and news releases in 1999, when he was a dot-com guy. It was also on his divorce papers from a Japanese artist in 2002. By the time he was co-authoring patents at Theranos a decade later, he was simply Sunny. Mr. Balwani’s early career was in software. He was a Northern California sales manager for Microsoft, selling the company’s products to executives at other firms. On Oct. 4, 1999, when the dot-com boom was roaring, he joined a start-up called CommerceBid.com as president. CommerceBid built platforms that enabled businesses to pit suppliers against each other to drive down costs. That idea seemed to have unlimited potential, and CommerceBid did not even make it to its first birthday before it was bought by another company in the space, called Commerce One, for $225 million. A few weeks later, Commerce One, whose shares were publicly traded, was worth $20 billion. Then the collapse came. A recession forced businesses to cut spending, and executives wondered if maybe the technology did not work well in any case. By 2004, Commerce One was worth nothing. It was a routine dot-com rags-to-riches-to-rags story, hardly even remembered among the bigger flameouts of the era. Failure in Silicon Valley has been considered a virtue because it teaches valuable lessons. But it often can be rewarding in its own right. Mr. Balwani made it out with a reported $40 million. He later became the chief operating officer at Theranos and had a romantic relationship with Ms. Holmes, which has been detailed in emails submitted to the court. Mr. Balwani also faces fraud charges, and his case is scheduled to go trial next year. Like Ms. Holmes, he has pleaded not guilty. The government’s case against Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, featured several key pieces of evidence that showed she intentionally deceived doctors, patients and investors in the blood testing start-up. They included: In 2010, Theranos created a 55-page report that prominently displayed the logos of the pharmaceutical companies Pfizer, Schering-Plough and GlaxoSmithKline. Investors such as Lisa Peterson, who manages investments for the wealthy DeVos family, and Walter Mosley, whose clients include the Walton family, testified that the report had helped persuade them to invest in Theranos. The problem? Pfizer, Schering-Plough and GlaxoSmithKline had not prepared or signed off on the report. While prosecutors did not establish that Ms. Holmes created the report, witnesses like Daniel Edlin, a former Theranos senior product manager, testified that she had signed off on all investor material. Theranos spent years discussing with the Department of Defense the possible deployment of its technology in the battlefield, but no partnership materialized. Yet Ms. Holmes told potential investors in a letter that Theranos had signed contracts with the U.S. military — claims that helped persuade them to invest, the investors testified. “We really relied on the fact that they had been doing work for pharma companies and the government for years,” Ms. Peterson said. Jurors got to hear those claims for themselves in a taped shareholder call. “We built the business around our partnerships with the pharmaceutical companies and our contracts with the military,” Ms. Holmes said in the recording. Emails between Theranos employees made up the bulk of the prosecution’s exhibits. Some of the emails showed when Theranos hid device failures, removed abnormal results from test reports and fudged demonstrations of its blood testing. In one case, Mr. Edlin asked a colleague for advice on how to demonstrate Theranos’s technology for potential investors. Michael Craig, a Theranos software engineer, recommended that Mr. Edlin use the demo app, a special setting on Theranos’s devices that said “running” or “processing” if an error had taken place, rather than display the mistake. The app would hide failures from the client, Mr. Craig wrote in an email. “Never a bad thing,” Mr. Edlin replied. “Let’s go with demo, thanks.” From the start, prosecutors have argued that Elizabeth Holmes intentionally deceived investors, doctors and patients as she sought investments and partnerships for Theranos, her once highflying blood testing start-up. In opening statements on Sept. 8, Robert Leach, the assistant U.S. attorney who is a lead prosecutor in the case, laid out the government’s central thesis: that Ms. Holmes courted investors and commercial partners with false claims about her company’s technology and its relationships with pharmaceutical companies and the military. “Out of time and out of money, Elizabeth Holmes decided to lie,” he repeatedly declared. To make that case, prosecutors called 29 witnesses to the stand. They included eight former Theranos employees, six investors, three commercial partners, two doctors and three patients. From a star-studded list of nearly 200 people the government had listed as potential witnesses, the highest-profile person to appear was former Defense Secretary James Mattis, who had served on Theranos’s board. Prosecutors presented evidence to show that Ms. Holmes perpetrated deceit, including that she knew of technology demonstrations that hid Theranos’s failures and was aware the company made false claims of working with the military. They also showed that Theranos had used a report with a pharmaceutical company’s logo to imply it had that company’s backing, even though the firm had not signed off on the report. Investors and partners testified that those claims had helped persuade them to give Theranos their business and money. The prosecution also detailed the dysfunction within Theranos’s lab, which handled the blood tests. Theranos had trumpeted its claim that its tests could discern various illnesses in patients with just a drop of blood. But Adam Rosendorff, one of Theranos’s former lab directors, spent six days on the stand explaining that the tests repeatedly produced inaccurate and irregular results. Other lab directors testified that they had essentially been figureheads; one spent just five to 10 hours at Theranos over his tenure. Daniel Edlin, a former senior product manager and Holmes family friend, testified that Ms. Holmes had signed off on Theranos’s marketing and investor materials. He also said Ramesh Balwani, the chief operating officer and Ms. Holmes’s onetime boyfriend, who is known as Sunny, had deferred to her when the two of them disagreed. “Generally, she was the C.E.O., so she had the final decision-making authority,” Mr. Edlin said. The trial of Elizabeth Holmes had everything: a charismatic, attractive and youthful female defendant; celebrities; sex; vast sums of money; the long shadow of Steve Jobs; lives of real people at risk. If it’s one of the most famous criminal cases ever to come out of Silicon Valley, it also sometimes seems like the only one. Prosecutors in Northern California brought 57 white-collar crime cases in fiscal year 2020. Even after accounting for the effect of Covid, cases have plunged from the peak of 350 in 1995. Not every white-collar case is a tech case or related to start-ups, which means there are only a handful of times each year when someone in Silicon Valley is accused of a crime. There are a lot of complicated reasons for this shortage of courtroom action. A frequent explanation is that it is the fault of a lackluster U.S. attorney’s office in San Francisco. Few prosecutors come to the Bay Area to make their reputations, and those that do — like Robert Mueller 20 years ago — soon move on to better jobs. Mr. Mueller took over the F.B.I. It’s not just a local issue. Fighting white-collar crime has been less of a priority for the Department of Justice since the Sept. 11 attacks brought fears of widespread terrorism. And for all the growing awareness of the power of tech companies, there is little public demand to hold them accountable. When David Anderson stepped down as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California early this year, he did an interview with a radio station. None of the questions from the host or from callers dealt with Silicon Valley. Mr. Anderson, a Trump appointee, had talked about making Silicon Valley a priority for his prosecutors. His first public appearance was on a panel titled “White Collar Crime in a High-Tech World.” But he was in office for two years, too few to really make an impact. The district has had an acting U.S. attorney, Stephanie Hinds, since March. Yet another reason is that Silicon Valley is a very rich place. That does not make government prosecutions impossible. But it ensures that top-flight defense attorneys can be brought in, making cases like Ms. Holmes’s neither short nor simple. Finally, there is a sense in Silicon Valley that failure — whether a company that went under or an investment that was lost — is best kept in the family, far away from prosecutors, regulators and the media. Investors are supposed to be sophisticated, and a case like Ms. Holmes’s can reveal just how foolish and naïve they were. The same is true of employees. Better to just forget about anything suspicious than allege fraudulent activity. After all, you wouldn’t want to miss out on the next opportunity. Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the failed blood testing start-up Theranos, surrounded herself with a constellation of moguls, four-star generals, venture capitalists and others during her time running the company. Ultimately, Theranos was undone after whistle-blowers who were concerned that the company was lying about its technology spoke to the media and to regulators. Here are some of the central figures in the rise and fall of Theranos and Ms. Holmes’s fraud trial. In 2018, the United States charged Elizabeth Holmes and her business partner, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, with nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The indictment accused the pair of engaging in a “scheme, plan and artifice to defraud investors as to a material matter.” In other words, they were accused of lying about Theranos’s business and technology to get money. The lies outlined in the indictment included claims Theranos made about its relationship with the military and the status of its partnership with Walgreens. Prosecutors also said that Theranos faked demonstrations of its technology and falsified validation reports from pharmaceutical companies and the financial health of its business. Wire fraud is a felony that carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and potential fines. Theranos also paid a $500,000 fine to settle civil securities fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018. It also settled multiple lawsuits with investors and partners before dissolving that year. Since the criminal indictment, the cases of Ms. Holmes and Mr. Balwani have been separated. Mr. Balwani faces trial next year. Further, some of the charges against Ms. Holmes have been dropped and others added.  She pleaded not guilty."

Her screen filled with dozens of calls and messages from friends, all sharing the same screenshot of the profile created of her on the app, a fake auction site called “Bulli Bai.” Ms. Bég, a former journalist with an active online presence, wasn’t alone. More than 100 other prominent Indian Muslim women, including artists, journalists, activists and lawyers, found that online images of themselves were being used without permission on the app, which went up on Saturday and was taken down again within about 24 hours. In June a similar app, called “Sulli Deals,” appeared. (Both terms are derogatory slang for Muslim women.) That one remained up for weeks and was taken down only after complaints from victims. Though the police opened an investigation, no one has been charged in that case. India’s online space is rife with misogyny and harassment of women. But the two “auctions” have amplified concern about the organized nature of the virtual bullying, and how targeted smears and threats of violence, particularly sexual violence, are deployed to try to silence women, especially those critical of some of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policies. “The intimidation is aimed at forcing Muslim women who raise their voices against the injustice to withdraw from public life,” said Ms. Bég, 26, who is pursuing a graduate degree at Columbia University. “But you don’t back off, even if everything gets overwhelming.” Muslim women were at the forefront of one of India’s largest protest movements in recent decades. In early 2020, before the coronavirus pandemic began in earnest in India, thousands blocked roads and held demonstrations in protest of a new citizenship law that was seen as prejudiced against Muslims. Women featured in the “auction” included Fatima Nafees, the mother of a student activist who disappeared more than five years ago after a fight with members of a right-wing student organization; a film star turned social activist, a researcher, and several other prominent Muslim women. Both the app that went up in June and the more recent one were hosted by GitHub, a Microsoft-owned open software development site based in San Francisco. On Sunday, India’s federal minister for communications, Ashwini Vaishnaw, said that GitHub had blocked the user behind the recent app. GitHub has not commented publicly on the episode. Karti Chidambaram, a member of India’s Parliament and a leader of the opposition Congress party, wrote on Twitter that he was appalled that those responsible apparently felt emboldened because of the government’s lack of action on the previous auction. “It is unacceptable that this project of dangerous anti-Muslim misogyny is back,” he said. On Monday, the police in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh said they had opened an investigation and filed a criminal complaint against several Twitter handles and developers of the app, based on the complaint of a Muslim woman. But many complaints said the lack of progress on the previous investigations had inspired little confidence. For years, Ms. Bég has been a vocal critic of India’s governing Hindu nationalists and their anti-minority policies under Mr. Modi. She has faced intense internet trolling, including death threats, on Twitter. Over the years, as the pressure has intensified, she said, she started self-censoring, avoiding critical posts on the policies of the Hindu nationalists. She said she had been worried about the rising intolerance, but the latest episode showcased how the online machinery was being used to make vocal Muslim women withdraw from public life, essentially eliminating any counternarrative. Hasiba Amin, a social media coordinator of the opposition Congress party, who was also featured on the auction app, says the fact that the violence and death threats against minorities online have recently gone beyond virtual is what keeps her awake. “What guarantees do we have from the government that tomorrow the threats and intimidation online is not going to turn into the real-time sexual violence on the streets?” she asked."

Sheriff Joe Pelle of Boulder County said at a news briefing on Monday that the property owned by Twelve Tribes, which was founded in Tennessee in the 1970s, had become a target of the inquiry after investigators ruled out the possibility that downed power lines might have sparked the fire. Still, Sheriff Pelle warned against jumping to conclusions regarding the fire’s origins, emphasizing that the investigation was in its early stages and that it could take weeks or even months to determine the exact cause. He said investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the U.S. Forest Service were assisting his department’s inquiry. “We’re going to take our time and be methodical because the stakes are huge,” Sheriff Pelle said. The efforts to determine what caused the fire are adding to the challenges that authorities are facing in Colorado, after heavy snowfall over the weekend blanketed the suburban areas that had been torched by the Marshall fire. About 35,000 people were forced to evacuate the area last week, and many families remain in shelters after more than 900 homes were destroyed. Authorities are still searching for two people missing in the blaze, which figured among the most destructive in Colorado history. A severe multiyear drought nurtured the brittle-dry conditions that allowed the fire to sweep through residential areas. Discussion of the Twelve Tribes property emerged on social media on Thursday, around the time the Marshall fire began spreading, when video of a structure on fire there started circulating. By Sunday, officials confirmed that the fire began on private property at the Boulder County intersection of Marshall Road and Highway 93, which is owned by Twelve Tribes. Sheriff Pelle confirmed on Monday that investigators were examining the site in addition to adjacent areas. Several witnesses who live nearby said they had alerted the authorities about the fire at the site before hurricane-force winds spread flames around Boulder County. Anne Michaels, a kindergarten teacher who lives in the area, said she was driving by the property on Thursday while talking to her mother on her mobile phone when she noticed something was wrong. “I said, ‘Mom, I see smoke,’” said Ms. Michaels, 43, adding that the smoke was clearly coming from the Twelve Tribes property. She said she called 911 shortly afterward to alert the authorities. Mike Zoltowski, another witness who reported seeing the fire on the property, while staying at a friend’s neighboring home, said he saw a fire crew on Thursday unsuccessfully try to put out what appeared to be a shed on fire before leaving the site. “As soon as I turned around and came back, they were gone,” Mr. Zoltowski told a local television station. “And that’s when I realized something is seriously wrong here, because the shed was still burning.” A spokeswoman for Twelve Tribes said on Monday that an investigation was taking place but declined to comment further. Twelve Tribes originated from a youth Bible study group in the 1970s in Chattanooga, Tenn. Since then, it has grown into an international network of self-governing communities scattered across North and South America, Europe and Australia. The settlement in Boulder is one of two in Colorado. The group promotes itself as an assemblage of up to 3,000 people united by a common belief in God, or Yahshua, and strict adherence to the Old and New Testaments of the Bible, according to its website. Men are expected to wear long beards and tie their hair back, while women dress modestly. Its members often work at several businesses owned by the group across the country, which include a deli in Boulder. Sheriff Pelle said earlier that a search warrant had been executed as part of the fire investigation, but did not say what location had been searched. He said that the initial assumptions that downed power lines might have sparked the fire were ruled out after fire investigators and work crews from Xcel Energy, which provides power to the area, determined that the lines in question were used to transmit not electricity but telecommunications data. In the meantime, the sheriff said investigators were trying to piece together what happened by speaking to as many people as possible. “What I’ve seen today coming in and out of this building meeting with these investigators are dozens of people,” Sheriff Pelle said at the briefing. He said investigators were “essentially working by hand and with small tools to try to get through those locations” to try to ascertain the origin of the blaze. “It is very, very difficult work given the debris, the heat,” he said, describing the investigation as “in full force and in full swing.” Evacuees were waiting for answers. Forrest Smith, 67, who escaped from his home with the clothes on his back, a coffee mug and his smartphone, said he welcomed the investigation into the blaze. But Mr. Smith, who was staying at a Red Cross shelter after the fire gutted his home, expressed doubt that the investigation would result in holding anyone accountable. “First of all, they’ve got to prove who did it,” said Mr. Smith, a retired truck driver. In any event, he said: “You can’t take it back. What’s done is done.”"

Members of both organizations were quickly arrested on attention-grabbing charges, accused of plotting to interfere with the certification of the 2020 vote count. Now congressional investigators are examining the role of another right-wing paramilitary group that was involved in a less publicly visible yet still expansive effort to keep President Donald J. Trump in power: the 1st Amendment Praetorian. Known in shorthand as 1AP, the group spent much of the postelection period working in the shadows with pro-Trump lawyers, activists, business executives and military veterans to undermine public confidence in the election and to bolster Mr. Trump’s hopes of remaining in the White House. By their own account, members of the 1st Amendment Praetorian helped to funnel data on purported election fraud to lawyers suing to overturn the vote count. They guarded celebrities like Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, at “Stop the Steal” rallies, where huge crowds gathered to demand that Mr. Trump remain in office. And they supported an explosive proposal to persuade the president to declare an emergency and seize the country’s voting machines in a bid to stay in power. None of 1AP’s top operatives have been arrested in connection with the Capitol riot, and it remains unclear how much influence they exerted or how seriously criminal investigators are focused on them. Still, the group had men on the ground outside the building on Jan. 6 and others at the Willard Hotel, near some of Mr. Trump’s chief allies. And in the days leading up to the assault, 1AP’s Twitter account posted messages suggesting that the group knew violence was imminent. “There may be some young National Guard captains facing some very, very tough choices in the next 48 hours,” read one message posted by the group on Jan. 4. Last month, citing some of these concerns, the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack issued a subpoena to Robert Patrick Lewis, the leader of 1AP. On the same day, it sent similar requests to Enrique Tarrio, the chairman of the Proud Boys, and Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers. As part of their inquiry, congressional investigators have obtained numerous audio recordings of 1AP members and are trying to determine how they fit into the broader investigation. Mr. Lewis did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but in recent months he has told parts of his story in online videos and podcasts. Made up largely of Special Forces veterans and former intelligence officials, 1AP was founded in September 2020 to protect Trump supporters from harassment at rallies and to safeguard free speech rights from “tyrannical, Marxist subversive groups,” Mr. Lewis wrote in a thread of tweets announcing the creation of the group. In a video attached to the thread, he said it would be “a tactical mistake” to discuss how many members 1AP had, noting only that it was several times more than the dozen in a standard Special Forces operational unit. By the time he founded 1st Amendment Praetorian, Mr. Lewis, who once served as a medic for a Special Forces team, had been out of the Army for a decade and reinvented himself as an author and commentator with an interest in military issues and right-wing politics. Among his works were two action novels describing how the Green Berets saved the American homeland from a fictional invasion and a memoir depicting his rise from poverty and adoption to success in the 10th Special Forces Group, an elite unit stationed in Germany. 1AP’s first “mission” — protecting conservative V.I.P.s — came in October 2020, when the group provided security at a march in Washington led by the Walk Away Foundation, an organization that seeks to persuade Democratic voters to leave the party, Mr. Lewis said in a YouTube video posted that December. The foundation’s leader, Brandon Straka, a former hairstylist in New York, was among those arrested in the Capitol attack. Court papers suggest that he recently began to cooperate with the government. At that event and others, 1AP provided more than bodyguards, Mr. Lewis said. Its protective detail also included “low-viz operators” dressed in plainclothes moving in the crowd. “We had eyes and ears everywhere,” he added. As the presidential election drew closer, Mr. Lewis branched out beyond personal protection and started giving interviews, casting himself as a security expert, to right-wing news outlets, including those connected to the QAnon conspiracy theory. Among his claims — so far unsubstantiated — was that “professional analysts” working for 1AP had infiltrated “encrypted forums” visited by members of the loose left-wing collective known as antifa and had discovered plans for a nationwide attack. “Our intelligence shows that no matter who wins the election, they are planning a massive ‘antifa Tet offensive’ bent on destroying the global order,” he told Fox News two days before Election Day. Once the votes were cast, Mr. Lewis turned his attention back toward guarding pro-Trump luminaries at rallies in Washington, where throngs of people showed up in support of the lie that the election had been rigged. One of his clients was Ali Alexander, a prominent “Stop the Steal” organizer, who was a featured speaker at the so-called Million MAGA March on Nov. 14, 2020. (Mr. Alexander has since given testimony to the House select committee.) Around the same time, 1AP became involved in another project connected to challenging the election. Members of the group, as Mr. Lewis put it in his video in December, began to scour the internet for “OSINT” — or open source intelligence — about allegations of election fraud. Whatever evidence they found, he said, they sent to Sidney Powell, a Dallas-based lawyer who filed four federal lawsuits in late 2020 contesting the results of the presidential vote. The lawsuits, which ultimately failed and resulted in a federal judge imposing sanctions on Ms. Powell, described without any credible evidence a plot by a cabal of international powers to hack U.S. voting machines and flip the count away from Mr. Trump. By mid-December 2020, 1AP took a job protecting one of Ms. Powell’s former clients, Mr. Flynn, at a second large pro-Trump rally in Washington. The rally was put together, public permits say, by Cindy Chafian, an organizer for the pro-Trump group Women for America First, which arranged for caravans of the president’s supporters to rally across the country after the election. (Ms. Chafian has also been subpoenaed by the House select committee.) This rally — on Dec. 12, 2020 — helped to solidify 1AP’s relationship with Mr. Flynn and Ms. Chafian. It also brought the group into contact with the Oath Keepers, who joined their protective detail, according to a television interview that the militia’s leader, Mr. Rhodes, gave that day. In the interview, Mr. Rhodes described how the two groups worked together at the rally. He then urged Mr. Trump to “wage war” against “traitors” at home by imposing martial law. That was the same message that Ms. Powell, Mr. Flynn and others in their orbit were advising at the time. Mr. Lewis says he played his own small part in the effort to persuade Mr. Trump to declare martial law. On Dec. 18, he said on a podcast last year, he drove Ms. Powell and Mr. Flynn to the White House to meet with Mr. Trump. It is not clear whether Mr. Lewis attended the meeting, where Ms. Powell and Mr. Flynn urged the president to declare a national emergency and demand a recount of key swing states on live TV, according to the business executive Patrick M. Byrne, who was also there. It was not long after the White House meeting that Mr. Lewis, like others, turned his attention toward Jan. 6, which was widely seen as the final opportunity for Mr. Trump and his allies to stop the certification of the presidential vote. On Jan. 5, Mr. Lewis gave a speech at an event organized by Ms. Chafian at Freedom Plaza in Washington, telling the crowd that they should not be “intimidated” by the “enemy at the gates.” Another organizer of events that day, Dustin Stockton, said that he saw Mr. Lewis and Ms. Chafian with other members of 1AP in a room at the Willard Hotel, not far from the “war room” where some of Mr. Trump’s top allies had gathered. On the day of the Capitol attack, at least one of Mr. Lewis’s lieutenants, Geoffrey Flohr, a former Michigan police officer, was outside the building walking the grounds and talking on his cellphone just before the riot erupted, according to public videos. (Mr. Flohr did not respond to messages seeking comment.) Ms. Chafian and her husband, Scott Chafian, were also in the mob outside the building. Another member of 1AP posted on Twitter that afternoon, claiming he was in an “overwatch position” in Arlington County, Va., where prosecutors say the Oath Keepers had placed at a hotel an armed “quick reaction force” that was prepared to move into Washington if needed. As for Mr. Lewis, he told The Daily Beast last year that he was at the Willard again on Jan. 6, away from the chaos at the Capitol. “Today is the day the true battles begin,” he wrote on Twitter just as the Capitol was breached."

Anything else was for amateurs. The devices, with the quirky-sounding name BlackBerry and the QWERTY keyboard that conditioned many people to type with their thumbs, were more ubiquitous than iPhones during the late 2000s. But as of Tuesday, Blackberry models that use the company’s operating systems will go the way of the Commodore computer and the LaserDisc. So will their trademark trackballs and Tic Tac-sized letter keys. As part of an “end of life” decommissioning program that was initially announced in 2020, BlackBerry said that as of Jan. 4, 2022, it would no longer support the devices as the Canadian company completes its yearslong shift from making mobile phones to a software-based business model. For some, the deadline represents a wistful conclusion to an era before touch screens, Apple Pay and TikTok, when BlackBerries dominated offices, airport lounges and the West Wing. President Barack Obama famously clung to his BlackBerry after taking office, prompting the White House to strip it down for security reasons. Kevin Michaluk, the founder of CrackBerry, a website and forum dedicated to the once-popular devices, waxed nostalgic on Monday about the rise and fall of the technology. In 2016, BlackBerry abandoned making phones, devices that the company, previously named Research in Motion, had come to define. “The initial sadness for me has been lived several times,” said Mr. Michaluk, who uses the nickname CrackBerry Kevin. “To use my real name, people don’t know who the hell I am.” Mr. Michaluk, 41, who lives in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said that BlackBerry devices, featuring model names like the Curve, Bold, Storm and Pearl, enhanced productivity without all of the distractions that come with iPhones. “It feels like they’re causing A.D.D. for most of us, rather than productivity right now,” he said of iPhones. “We went from analog phones to the pendulum swinging too far. You can’t actually get anything done on it because you’re constantly bombarded by sensory overload.” In a message posted on its website on Dec. 22, BlackBerry reminded users that devices running legacy services over cellular networks or WiFi would no longer be able to receive or send text messages or other data, make phone calls or contact 911. The company, which thanked its users for their loyalty over the years, did not immediately comment further on Monday. On its website, the company pointed out that Android-powered models like the BlackBerry KEY2, which was manufactured by the Chinese company TCL under a partnership that ended in 2020, would not be affected by the change. That might come as a relief to Carrie Bradshaw, Sarah Jessica Parker’s character in “And Just Like That,” the reboot of “Sex and the City,” who uses a BlackBerry KEY2. Few people came to be more synonymous with BlackBerry than did Mr. Obama, whose reliance — ahem, addiction — to his mobile device presented a conundrum when he was elected to the presidency in 2008. Writing in his 2020 memoir, “A Promised Land,” Mr. Obama recalled, “My team did throw me one bone when it came to freedom: I was able to keep my BlackBerry — or, rather, I was given a new, specially modified device, approved only after several weeks of negotiations with various cybersecurity personnel.” Mr. Obama said that he could send or receive emails only from a list of 20 or so vetted contacts on his BlackBerry, which had its headphone jack and microphone removed and did not work as a phone. “Michelle joked that my BlackBerry was like one of those play phones you give toddlers,” he said, “where they get to press buttons and it makes noises and things light up but nothing actually happens.” Adam Matlock, 37, who runs TechOdyssey, a technology review channel on YouTube, said on Monday that he received many messages from BlackBerry users expressing concerns about no longer being able to use the devices. “They’ve been holding onto it for so long because there’s no replacement,” he said. “I always felt like BlackBerries, they were special because they had a keyboard and were not trying to be another phone with a touch screen.” Even if BlackBerry didn’t decommission its older devices, Mr. Matlock said, they would be virtually impossible to run once major wireless carriers like Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile phase out 3G technology during the next few years. “I think it’s unfortunate that they’re ending support for it,” he said. “I understand the decision because the platform itself is pretty much obsolete at this point.” Mr. Matlock, who lives in Houston, keeps some of his vintage devices in his office, he said, like the BlackBerry 7100g. “They always felt kind of special to me,” he said. Mr. Michaluk, or CrackBerry Kevin, said his favorite model was the BlackBerry Bold 9000 because it had leather on the back. “I have a little shelf with a little kickstand that it leans against,” he said. “Let’s call it a tasteful shrine.” One of the first models that he owned was the BlackBerry 8700, which had a jog wheel on the side that let users scroll through menus and messages. “It was a little tank,” he said. “You could throw the thing across the room like a baseball, and it would keep working.” Mr. Michaluk now uses an iPhone. “I’m now OK with that,” he said."

Exercise, meditation, prayer, breakfast (whey and, as she spelled it, “bannanna”) followed. By 6:45 a.m., a time when slackers were still fumbling for the alarm clock, she was at the office of Theranos, the blood-testing company she founded in 2003. Ms. Holmes had many rules at Theranos: “I am never a minute late. I show no excitement. ALL ABOUT BUSINESS. I am not impulsive. I know the outcome of every encounter. I do not hesitate. I constantly make decisions and change them as needed. I speak rarely. I call bullshit immediately.” It worked. Ms. Holmes’s resolve was so forceful, and fit so neatly into the Silicon Valley cliché of achieving the impossible by refusing to admit it was impossible, that it inspired belief right up to the moment on Monday when a jury officially convicted her of four counts of fraud. The verdict signaled the end of an era. In Silicon Valley, where the line between talk and achievement is often vague, there is finally a limit to faking it. From Stanford University dropout to Theranos’s $9 billion valuation to conviction, it is an epic rise and fall that will be chewed over in the coffee shops and juice bars of Palo Alto, Calif., until the tech industry departs for a new life in Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos’ off-world colonies. For a decade, Ms. Holmes fooled savvy investors, hundreds of smart employees, an all-star board and a media eager to anoint a new star even, or especially, if she had no qualifications. Just as Silicon Valley is a cartoonish version of American notions about the virtues of hard work and getting rich quick, so Ms. Holmes was a heightened version of Silicon Valley. As her self-improvement scheme made clear, she was trying to turn herself into a machine that had no time for anything but work. This was not for her own benefit, of course, but humanity’s. She perfectly encapsulated the Silicon Valley credo that tech was here to serve us, and never mind exactly how it did it, the billions it was making or whether it even worked. Whenever anyone — a regulator, an investor, a reporter — wanted to know a little more about exactly how the Theranos machines functioned, the company cried “trade secrets.” The real secret, of course, was that Theranos didn’t have any trade secrets because its machines didn’t work. But her answer worked for a long time. Hiding fraud behind the imperatives of secrecy wasn’t the only way Ms. Holmes’s actions were rooted in tradition. Her self-improvement plan dated back to Ben Franklin but found its most indelible expression in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s creation of Jay Gatsby, the mysterious, alluring, handsome millionaire who also ran a few swindles. Gatsby was practically Ms. Holmes’s brother. He, too, got where he was with a schedule and rules, in his case written inside a book when he was a striving youth: 5 p.m.-6 p.m.: Practice elocution, poise and how to obtain it 7 p.m.-9 p.m.: Study needed inventions The parallels with Ms. Holmes extended even to Gatsby’s equally loose grasp of spelling. “No more smokeing or chewing,” he admonished himself. Gatsby was a bootlegger but also used Wall Street to cheat. He sold fake bonds. Ms. Holmes chose Silicon Valley, the last and greatest of all human dreams. In the first decade of the century, it promised to reinvent transportation, friendship, commerce, politics, money. Blood-testing must have seemed like a breeze by comparison, especially since Ms. Holmes was a natural salesperson, as good at bending reality as Steve Jobs himself. Here she was in an interview with the radio show Tech Nation in 2005, explaining what Theranos was all about: “We focused on creating a customized medicine tool that could be used in the home by every patient, so that every day, a patient can get real-time analysis of their blood samples.” Who could not applaud such an invention? Theranos was making a messy, uncertain and time-consuming medical process into something effortless and painless. “A little teeny needle that pulls a little teeny drop of blood,” she said. Software would do the rest. Tech Nation’s host, Moira Gunn, has a master’s degree in computer science and a doctor of philosophy in mechanical engineering, but she was dazzled. “How old are you, Elizabeth?” she asked. “I’m 21,” Ms. Holmes said. Her age was brought up not to knock down her claims but to underline how impressive they were. “I’m gonna go tell my two children, they better get off their duffs,” Ms. Gunn exclaimed. Ms. Holmes said Theranos’s device was in “the production phase.” She added, “We hope to release it, actually, to a pharmaceutical partner around mid-to-late this year.” Thirteen years later, when the company dissolved, it had never successfully released a device. In 2005, however, even reinventing blood-testing at 21 was not enough, so deep were our expectations of genius. Ms. Holmes was asked about her future, and gave the stock Silicon Valley response: You ain’t seen nothing yet. Theranos already had the “next generations” of its device in prototype, she said. It was miniaturized to make it even faster, to make it “more high-throughput.” It would be automated: “You don’t even have to touch your finger on the device.” So in one of the first media interviews Ms. Holmes ever did, she said Theranos had a working device that would be able to analyze your health without actually touching you. No one called her on it. No wonder she and her deputy and boyfriend, Ramesh Balwani, the company’s chief operating officer who was known as “Sunny,” thought they could brazen it out in the Silicon Valley tradition until they had something that actually worked. This is a credulous age. William Perry, a Theranos board member, was secretary of defense under President Bill Clinton, a mathematician, engineer and Stanford professor. Not, in other words, a fool with regard to Silicon Valley. Yet he told The New Yorker in 2014 that Ms. Holmes “has sometimes been called another Steve Jobs, but I think that’s an inadequate comparison. She has a social consciousness that Steve never had. He was a genius; she’s one with a big heart.” Mr. Perry declined to comment. Mr. Jobs, who died in 2011, might as well have been a recruiter for Theranos. Adam Rosendorff, a lab director at Theranos, testified during Ms. Holmes’s trial that he thought the company was going to be “the next Apple.” He applied for the job after reading a biography of the Apple co-founder. “The whole excitement around Steve Jobs was very compelling to me,” he said. “I wanted to make a more global impact on health care and I thought that joining a diagnostics company would help me do that.” Mr. Rosendorff grew disillusioned before Theranos’s misleading claims were exposed, but Mr. Perry stuck it out until December 2016, when the start-up was forced to change its board in a futile attempt to survive. With believers like these, Ms. Holmes’s dream must have seemed so close that she could hardly fail to grasp it. A couple more late nights from the engineering team, a few more magazine covers declaring her a genius, and it would be as good as done. So where does this conviction leave the rest of us — her marks, her enablers, her investors and former fans? Ripe for the next huckster that comes along, probably. Some Silicon Valley promises are so sweet we just can’t get enough of them. Immortality. Crypto. Flying cars. Mars. Digital harmony. Wealth beyond compare. As Fitzgerald wrote, we will always be a sucker for the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us."

High-risk patients carrying the Delta variant could benefit greatly from two particular monoclonal antibody treatments shown to reduce hospitalization and death. But those medications would most likely do nothing for patients with Omicron, who would only respond to a third antibody treatment that is in very short supply. While U.S. officials have endorsed using a workaround test that can identify Omicron’s genetic signature, experts say it’s not feasible for large health systems facing a crush of patients to employ in each case. That makes treating patients challenging in places like Maryland, where cases are spiking and Omicron accounts for roughly 58 percent of them. The Delta variant is also holding strong in the Great Plains and swaths of the West, including California. While there is no approved test to determine each individual’s variant, a national network of state and other labs use genome-sequencing tests to track variants broadly in communities. Health systems then use those regional estimates or their own data to decide which antibody treatments to use in their clinics and hospitals. Many of them concluded that a community of largely Delta patients would benefit most from the antibody drugs made by Regeneron and Eli Lilly, while communities where Omicron patients are predominant would benefit from antibodies from GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology. Federal officials have dabbled with making the decision for the nation. On Dec. 23, they stopped shipments of antibody treatments by Eli Lilly and Regeneron after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 73 percent of U.S. Covid cases were Omicron. An outcry followed from Republican political leaders, who argued that some people in their states were still infected with Delta. And on Tuesday, the C.D.C. slashed its estimate of national Omicron cases to 59 percent. On Dec. 31, federal officials resumed national shipping all of the antibody treatments. For the next few weeks, as the country grapples with this uneven mix of both variants, tailoring treatments to each patient will be “extraordinarily difficult,” said Dr. Alex Greninger, assistant director of the clinical virology laboratories at the University of Washington Medical Center. Dr. Greninger is credited with developing one of the first tests to detect the coronavirus in the United States. But he is pessimistic that health systems can pivot quickly to sort out which patients have Delta or Omicron. And although a shortcut test can detect Omicron, there’s no simple way to report the results in bulk, he said. What’s more, the genome sequencing used by public health officials takes nearly a week — too long to target the early antibody treatments that have been found to reduce the need for hospitalizations. That makes patient care particularly difficult right now, said Dr. Mark Siedner, an infectious disease clinician and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital. In Massachusetts and nearby states, an estimated 44.5 percent of cases are Omicron. Dr. Siedner said his health system has stopped using the Regeneron and Eli Lilly antibodies that are not effective against Omicron and are “anxiously awaiting” more doses of the effective treatment by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology. “We’re in a holding pattern and it’s a terrible time to be in that place,” he said. Officials across the United States, from President Biden on down, have been insisting that they are no longer in the shutdown business, and will not order any closures to contain the latest surge in coronavirus cases. But Omicron may be taking the decision out of their hands. So many workers are testing positive or calling in sick that businesses, schools, government agencies and more are being crippled by staff shortages that may force them to close some operations anyway. Airlines began canceling flights in large numbers on Christmas Eve for lack of crews, and the problems have continued into the new year. Broadway shows have been canceled because of outbreaks backstage. Major companies have delayed or entirely jettisoned return-to-office plans. Many colleges are switching back to virtual classes to start the semester. And public school leaders are struggling to respond to a situation that has changed greatly from when students went on holiday breaks before Christmas, barely a week ago. Four large city school systems — Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Newark — have joined a growing list of public schools around the country that put off reopening on Monday, switched to remote instruction, or both. Covid-19 outbreaks and staffing shortages forced their hands. Omicron has driven case numbers to staggering new heights: The United States is averaging more than 484,600 daily cases over the past week, a 238 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are up 41 percent in the past two weeks, while deaths are down by 3 percent. In some cases, the very resources needed to cope with Omicron’s staffing disruptions are themselves being disrupted, from the call-center agents who rebook canceled flights to the frontline medical professionals who care for sick workers. Infected police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and transit workers are leaving shifts unfilled. In New York City, subway lines have been delayed by staff shortages, and the Fire Department has asked residents not to call 911 except in a real emergency. Many elected leaders of both parties have discarded their sharpest pandemic-curbing tools, like closing government offices, schools and businesses, which have come with staggering economic, social and political costs. Instead, elected officials have stressed the importance of vaccination, booster shots and mask-wearing. “I am not prepared to shut down schools or the economy at this time,” Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York, a Democrat, said before New York suffered a string of new daily case records last week. “I will not overreact and send this economy spiraling out of control once again.” Many leading public health experts aren’t seeking shutdowns, either. If anything, many appear to be taking an opposite tack. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced new guidelines to help schools stay open, by allowing children who are exposed to the coronavirus to “test to stay” instead of automatically having to quarantine at home. And it has said that some Americans who test positive can leave isolation after five days, half as long as previous recommendations. A federal judge granted a preliminary injunction on Monday blocking the Department of Defense from taking “any adverse action” against 35 Navy sailors who have refused to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, arguing that it violated their religious freedoms. The service members — including Navy SEALs and members of the Naval Special Warfare Command — had filed suit against the Biden administration arguing that their “sincerely held religious beliefs forbid each of them from receiving the Covid-19 vaccine for a variety of reasons based upon their Christian faith.” The Pentagon had mandated that all active-duty troops receive the vaccine. The judge, Reed O’Connor of the Northern District of Texas, effectively blocked the department from punishing those troops. “Our nation asks the men and women in our military to serve, suffer, and sacrifice. But we do not ask them to lay aside their citizenry and give up the very rights they have sworn to protect,” Judge O’Connor wrote in his 26-page order. He added: “The Covid-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no Covid-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.” The group represents a small fraction of active-duty troops from the United States, and as of mid-December, most active-duty soldiers and members of the Navy had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Thousands have requested religious exemptions, and none have been granted so far, officials said in December. The decision follows another injunction by a judge in November against President Biden’s national vaccine mandate for health care workers. Judge O’Connor, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, has reliably tossed several Democratic policies that have been challenged on the federal bench. In response to the injunction on Monday, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, wrote on Twitter, “This is a major win!” A spokesperson for the Pentagon could not immediately be reached for comment. But on Monday evening, John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said that defense officials were reviewing the injunction, according to The Washington Post. The coronavirus is spreading faster than ever at the start of 2022, but the last days of 2021 brought some encouraging news about the latest wave of infections. With growing evidence that the Omicron variant produces less severe illness than in earlier waves, governments are redoubling their focus on vaccinations and boosters, which are increasingly seen as the world’s ticket to “living with Covid.” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert, said on Sunday that hospitalizations, which are not rising as fast, were a more important barometer than reported cases for the severity of the Omicron wave, a sharp distinction after nearly two years of tallying daily case counts. “As you get further on and the infections become less severe, it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations as opposed to the total number of cases,” Dr. Fauci said. Still, the case numbers remain staggering. The world is recording an average of nearly 1.5 million new cases every day, twice as many per day as were recorded nearly a week ago, although the figures in many places may have been distorted by holiday reporting delays. In the United States, experts forecast that the Omicron wave could crest in mid-January, but not before millions were infected every week. Across Europe, caseloads have soared to new highs and ushered in another bitter winter of social restrictions, mask mandates and shifting travel rules. The holidays made things worse as colder weather and festive gatherings drove people indoors, where the virus circulates more easily. Airports and mass transit hubs were snarled with travelers after many people stayed home last year. And with many government offices closed, testing and case data were not being compiled as regularly, leaving officials and experts, at least temporarily, with an incomplete picture of how bad things were getting. As much of the world returns to work this week, however, several trends are becoming clearer: Although many governments are loath to lock down again, officials are tweaking rules to account for Omicron’s blazing spread. Paris last week became the latest European city to reimpose an outdoor mask mandate. South Korea joined France and others in setting an expiry date for its vaccine passes, hoping to push more people to get boosters. Here are some other trends to watch for: Mayor Eric Adams insisted on Monday morning that New York City’s schools would stay open despite an extraordinary surge in Omicron cases. But about a third of city parents did not send their children back to classrooms on the first day after the holiday break. Attendance was just over 67 percent, slightly higher than the low point of 65 percent the system reached on the day before winter break. Throughout the day on Monday, Adams was adamant that the system would remain open. He repeated the message in a series of television interviews and after his first official school visit since taking office on New Year’s Day. “We’re really excited about the opening of our schools,” Mr. Adams said outside the school, Concourse Village Elementary School in the Bronx. “We want to be extremely clear: the safest place for our children is a school building.” Mr. Adams said that remote learning had been disastrous for too many of the city’s nearly one million schoolchildren in the nation’s largest school district, and had been particularly harmful for children in low-income neighborhoods and homeless students. But the calm that Mr. Adams sought to project was not shared by the many parents and educators who greeted Monday morning with profound trepidation. After roughly a year of remarkably low virus transmission in schools, Covid cases soared in the week before the winter break, prompting the closures of 11 schools and over 400 classrooms, and the contact tracing system for city schools effectively collapsed amid the surge. New York City reported 35,650 new virus cases on Sunday, with a 7-day average test positivity rate of nearly 22 percent, according to state data. Some families and elected officials have called on Mr. Adams to delay the start of school by a few days to allow every child and educator to get tested. And teachers have raised questions about how schools will be properly staffed with so many teachers sick with the virus or quarantining due to exposures. “This is an all hands on deck moment,” Mr. Adams said, acknowledging that administrators who are not normally in the classroom would be used to address staff shortages if necessary. Mr. Adams has endorsed a plan created by former Mayor Bill de Blasio that is designed to keep more classrooms open as the surge continues. The plan calls for distributing 1.5 million rapid at-home test kits to schools. Starting Monday, the city is also doubling its random in-school testing program to give P.C.R. tests to 20 percent of consenting children in each school weekly. But most families have not opted in to allow their children to be tested, which has made the testing pool very small at some schools. The mayor and the new schools chancellor, David C. Banks, are betting that their plan to increase testing will prevent major outbreaks. “We’re going to turn those question marks into an exclamation point: we’re staying open,” Mr. Adams said. Mr. Adams and Mr. Banks have so far resisted calls to mandate booster shots for educators or vaccines for children. The mayor has said a decision will be made this spring about mandating vaccines for students for the fall. “We’re not at the point of mandate,” Mr. Adams said Monday, as he encouraged eligible New Yorkers to get vaccinated and boosted. Michael Mulgrew, president of the city’s teachers’ union, said in an email to members that he had encouraged Mr. Adams to start the year remotely. But on Monday morning, Mr. Mulgrew said he was working closely with the new mayor and that schools had been some of the safest places in the city throughout the pandemic. Later on Monday, Gov. Kathy Hochul reiterated her commitment to keeping New York’s children in schools. “My view is that every child should be back in school unless they are testing positive,” she said. The state has distributed 5.2 million at-home test kits to schools thus far, and another 3.8 million arrived yesterday and have yet to be distributed. Under the current rule, test kits will only be provided to students for known exposures that occur in classrooms, although Ms. Hochul said that policy was under review. She also cautioned against a return to remote learning. “The teachers did the best they could. The parents did the best they could,” she said. “But we ask too much.” In particular, she spoke about the effects of remote learning on children in communities of color, those who lacked resources and those without high-speed internet access — an existing digital divide that she said had widened into a “digital canyon.” “We cannot have that,” Ms. Hochul said. “That was an injustice. We cannot have that anymore.” SACRAMENTO — With the Omicron variant raging across California, millions of schoolchildren returned to classrooms on Monday, ending the holiday break as many had spent it — masked, distanced, apprehensive and in long lines with their parents, scrambling for coronavirus tests. Few schools were closed in a state whose Covid-19 precautions have been among the most aggressive in the nation. California has managed to maintain comparatively low rates of virus-related deaths and hospitalizations. But infections have soared recently because of the highly contagious variant, which appears to result in less severe cases. In hundreds of districts, in-person instruction was conditioned on heightened health requirements and fraught with the understanding that even those might not prevent a return to remote learning. “Frankly, the disruption I’m worried about isn’t Day 1 — it’s Day 2, 3 or 4 if we get 30 or 40 or 50 positive cases,” said Alex Cherniss, the superintendent of the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, where, after days of impassioned community debate, some 10,000 students in coastal Los Angeles County returned to class on Monday. “People are exhausted here,” he said. California’s largest school district, Los Angeles Unified, was not scheduled to resume classes until next week. But on Monday, the district issued new rules requiring baseline testing as a condition of returning to campus, regardless of vaccination status. Previously, testing had been optional for vaccinated and asymptomatic students and employees. In many other districts, reopening classrooms on Monday also hinged on fresh rounds of coronavirus testing. In Marin County, students had been given kits to test for the virus before re-entering campus. In Sacramento County, families stood for hours over the weekend at testing sites hastily erected by school districts or took advantage of an infusion of six million take-home tests the state supplied to districts across California as Omicron was starting to spike. “We did two tests at home and he’s fine,” Emily Ramey said as she dropped off her younger child at a middle school in suburban Sacramento. “I’m just hoping that everyone else tested, too.” Los Angeles Unified already conducts the nation’s largest weekly school-based coronavirus testing program, but health officials in the county have ratcheted up other measures that will affect the hundreds of thousands of students and employees in the school system, along with those in private schools and nearly 80 other public school districts. New health rules starting Jan. 1 mandate, for example, that returning students at all of the county’s districts wear face masks not only indoors but also outside at recess, and that school employees upgrade to medical-grade N95 or KN95 face coverings. Gov. Gavin Newsom has reiterated that the state is “committed” to keeping classrooms open and promised last month to make home testing kits “available to every K-12 public school student as they head back to the classroom from winter break.” But not all districts had received their allotment by Monday. San Francisco schools increased mobile testing sites throughout the city and strongly encouraged students to get tested before returning, in part because they will not receive their allotment of tests from the state until later this week. In Palos Verdes, Mr. Cherniss said concern over Omicron almost prompted the district to delay reopening until next week. But when he announced he was considering it, he said, the outcry from parents was fierce. Eventually, the district opted to reopen as scheduled, but to strongly encourage students to test before returning. “We did a big push over the weekend,” he said. “We handed out 2,000 home tests in less than three hours and did another 2,000 live tests. More than 100 were positive.” The top medical official at the U.S. Capitol urged lawmakers and their staff members on Monday to work remotely and take additional precautions against the coronavirus, after the seven-day positivity rate at the building’s on-site coronavirus test center rose rapidly from less than 1 percent to more than 13 percent. In a letter to congressional offices obtained by The New York Times, Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician, informed lawmakers that there had been an “unprecedented number of cases” among hundreds of people who work in the Capitol complex, with dozens testing positive daily. Of the cases detected, 65 percent were symptomatic, the letter said. As of Dec. 15, a majority of the infections were breakthrough cases, with 61 percent caused by the Omicron variant and 38 percent caused by the Delta variant. The building offers daily testing for lawmakers, their staffs, Capitol workers and journalists who work in the building, and lawmakers were among the first wave of eligible people to receive vaccinations and boosters in the country. The breakthrough infections, Dr. Monahan said, had not led to any hospitalizations, serious complications or deaths. “I urge all individuals also to continue essential measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus,” Dr. Monahan wrote in his letter, encouraging lawmakers to maximize the amount of remote work done in their offices and advising all people in the building to use medical-grade masks. With the Senate set to hold votes on Tuesday, Democrats have now decided to meet virtually for their weekly caucus lunch, according to a senior aide. The House is not set to return until Jan. 10. Dr. Monahan has little authority to enforce his guidance, in an institution where individual congressional offices can set their own policies and guidelines. Mask-wearing in recent months has largely been divided along party lines, with two Republicans, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Andrew Clyde, incurring more than $100,000 combined in fines for flouting the mask mandate on the House floor. The Food and Drug Administration on Monday authorized booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds, a group that became eligible for initial shots in May. Regulators also shortened by a month the amount of time that adult and adolescent recipients of Pfizer’s vaccine should wait between their second and third doses, allowing them to seek booster shots five months after their second injections.  And they allowed some children aged 5 to 11 with immune deficiencies to seek a third shot, including those who have undergone solid organ transplants or have conditions that amount to “an equivalent level of immunocompromise,” the agency said in a statement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee is set to meet Wednesday to review the F.D.A. moves and decide whether to recommend the changes. If it does, the C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, is expected to quickly sign off on them.   The F.D.A. said that it examined data from Israel on more than 6,300 people in the 12- to 15-year-old age group who received booster shots at least five months after a second dose. That data “enabled the F.D.A. to reassess the benefits and risks of the use of a booster in the younger adolescent population in the setting of the current surge in Covid-19 cases,” the agency said. The review showed no new safety concerns, including no new cases of myocarditis, a rare heart-related side effect that has been tied to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, particularly in younger men. The condition involves inflammation of the heart muscle. Dr. Peter Marks, who oversees the agency’s division that regulates vaccines, said that the risk of myocarditis was substantially lower after a booster dose than after a second dose, citing U.S. safety monitoring data. The benefits of a third shot outweighed the potential risks, he said, because it may better protect individuals against both the Delta and Omicron variants. Regulators also relied on Israeli data in shortening the interval between second and third doses of the Pfizer vaccine. No new safety issues have emerged in the United States among more than four million people 16 and older who got a third dose at least five months after a second, the F.D.A. said.  Because studies have shown that a Pfizer booster dose increases protection against the Omicron variant, a shorter interval might offer “better protection sooner,” the agency said. Other studies have shown that the potency of two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine ebbs over time.  “We do know that waning has occurred by five months,” Dr. Janet Woodcock, the F.D.A.’s acting commissioner said at a Monday morning news conference at which she and Dr. Marks gave updates on their deliberations about whether to further expand authorizations for Covid vaccines. The F.D.A. has not received sufficient dataon the benefits of a booster shot of Moderna’s vaccine at five months, and so is sticking to the six-month interval for that vaccine. “We will obviously be receptive to data that are submitted to us from Moderna and we’ll take action on those data with all due speed,” Dr. Marks said. He declined to say whether authorization of a third shot was in the offing for those who received one dose of Johnson & Johnson and a second dose of either Pfizer or Moderna’s vaccine. He said the combination appears “to give a very good immune response,” but that more data is needed over time. Asked about booster shots for 5- to 11- year olds, Dr. Marks said that only about a quarter of them have been vaccinated, mostly in the last two months. “It would be great to get a larger percentage of those kids vaccinated, and then we’ll see how many months afterward we need to get them boosted,” he said. No vaccine is yet authorized for children under five. “We certainly understand that there is a pressing need in that age range,” Dr. Marks said, promising that the F.D.A. “will move with appropriate speed with the appropriate data in hand.” Hospitalizations for the coronavirus are rising steeply in New York State, approaching the peak of last winter’s surge and driving the number of deaths reported in a single day above 100 for the first time since last March, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday. Hospitalizations have now surpassed last winter’s peak in New York City, the governor said. She added that there were some signs that this wave of hospitalizations may not be as severe as past surges, but she said the rapid rise was still “a trend that is troubling.” “We’re not in a good place, I’m going to be really honest with you,” Ms. Hochul said at a news briefing in Rochester, as she announced additional testing sites and the arrival of millions of rapid tests to help schools stay open through the virus spike.  Hospitalizations are being closely watched in New York City, one of the first places to be hit hard by the Omicron variant, as a bellwether for the nation as a whole. Omicron was first reported in New York City a month ago, and led to an enormous surge in new cases, from less than 2,500 per day to nearly 50,000 per day on New Year’s Eve. But in the past 10 days, hospitalizations have started to rise even more steeply than cases in New York City, leaping 130 percent between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve, compared to a 60 percent rise in cases over the same period, state data shows. As of Sunday, more than 4,500 people were hospitalized in the city, 500 of them in intensive care units. Statewide, nearly 9,000 people were hospitalized, and 103 people were reported to have died on Sunday. The number of Covid patients in New York City intensive care units is still lower than the peak of last winter’s surge, before vaccines were widely available, when about 750 people were in intensive care. And hospitalizations remain much lower than when Covid-19 first swept the city in spring 2020 and 12,000 people were hospitalized on the worst days, 3,000 of them in intensive care. Unvaccinated people are far more likely to be hospitalized with Covid-19 than vaccinated people, state data shows. In the week ending Dec. 20, the rate of unvaccinated people hospitalized for Covid statewide was 30 per 100,000, compared to a rate of 2 per 100,000 for the fully vaccinated. The hospitalizations are threatening to wear down a health care system whose ranks are already thinned by infections and attrition during the pandemic, and hospitals are readying emergency staffing plans. More than 20 hospitals across the state have been ordered to stop elective surgeries because they lack the capacity to perform them. But Ms. Hochul said that some hospital executives have told her between 20 and 50 percent of their Covid patients are not suffering from severe symptoms, but that they are testing positive in the hospital incidentally, after being admitted for other reasons such as car accidents. As a result, beginning Tuesday, the state will begin to ask hospitals to break down how many patients are being admitted for acute Covid-19 symptoms, in an effort to further decipher this wave’s severity. “I just want to always want to be honest with New Yorkers about how bad this is,” Ms. Hochul said. “Yes, the sheer numbers of people infected are high, but I want to see if hospitalizations are correlated to that.” With schools open in New York City and much of the state on Monday, and masks still optional in certain fully vaccinated settings, some are calling on the city and state to do more to slow the hospitalizations down. Mark Levine, the Manhattan borough president, called on policymakers to immediately urge people to work from home and avoid large gatherings for the next two weeks, as part of a 16-point plan he released Monday. “Hospitalizations in NYC are rising faster than at any point since March 2020,” he wrote on Twitter. “We can’t just accept this. We have to do more to slow this wave.” The Omicron surge has prompted sharp new limits on the number of journalists allowed to attend White House news briefings. The board of the White House Correspondents Association voted on Sunday to limit attendance to 14 reporters, sitting spaced apart in a room with 49 chairs. Three major news agencies will always be represented, two spots are earmarked for major U.S. television networks, and there will be one pool reporter each for print, radio, TV and foreign outlets. The remaining five seats will be rotated on various schedules among 48 news organizations, including The New York Times. The president of the association, Steve Portnoy of CBS Radio, wrote in an email to members, “Given the virulence of the spread, medical experts have once again advised that it would be prudent to substantially reduce the number of people working in the cramped, poorly ventilated work space that we share.” He said that standing in the briefing room’s aisles, a common practice for reporters without assigned seats, “is not welcome at this time” because photographers need room to maintain social distance as they work. The association is also urging its members to stay away from the White House when not on a specific assignment, to minimize the chances of “an outbreak that might limit our ability to cover the president in close quarters,” Mr. Portnoy wrote. “I promise this won’t last a day longer than necessary,” he said in the email, adding that the board would revisit the situation by Jan. 21. As hospitals already strained by the Delta variant threaten to buckle under a crush of patients infected with the even more contagious Omicron, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci said Americans should focus more on the threat the winter wave poses to hospitals and less on the record number of cases. Over the past week, an average of more than 401,200 cases has been reported each day in the United States, tripling from two weeks ago and the first time the number has topped 400,000, according to a New York Times database (new case numbers are slightly depressed because fewer states are reporting after the New Year holiday). Hospitalizations were by comparison up 33 percent, however, to 92,300, while deaths had dropped 4 percent to an average of 1,249 daily. It’s unclear how many hospitalizations are patients infected with Omicron rather than the Delta variant, which scientists believe is significantly more virulent. According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the week ending Dec. 25, Omicron accounted for over 58 percent of new cases versus over 41 percent for Delta. Dr. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, noted on Sunday on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos” that many new infections, especially in people who are vaccinated and boosted, result in no symptoms or mild symptoms, making the absolute number of cases less important than it was for previous versions of the virus. “As you get further on and the infections become less severe, it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations as opposed to the total number of cases,” Dr. Fauci said. That advice is in keeping with what many epidemiologists have said all along. Despite the daily drumbeat of case counts, the number of positive tests has never been a perfect indicator of the course of the epidemic. The number of cases has exploded because the Omicron variant seems to be much more contagious and able to evade vaccines than other earlier variants, which has spurred more widespread testing. What’s more, the official numbers are almost certainly an undercount, because many people are testing positive on rapid at-home tests or carrying the virus without any symptoms. Yet, as Dr. Fauci told Mr. Stephanopoulos, the concern is not so much the mild or asymptomatic Omicron cases as it is the number of people with severe or fatal infections. “The real bottom line that you want to be concerned about,” he said, “is are we getting protected by the vaccines from severe disease leading to hospitalization?” So far, vaccines and boosters appear to be providing that protection. But the unvaccinated remain at risk. “I’m still very concerned about the tens of millions of people who are not vaccinated at all because even though many of them are going to get asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, a fair number of them are going to get severe disease,” Dr. Fauci said. The Louisiana Department of Health tweeted on Sunday that hospitalizations in the state have topped 1,000, and that 76 percent of those hospitalized “are not up to date” on their vaccination status. Also, even if Omicron is milder, as most evidence suggests, a higher caseload means more health care workers who cannot work because they test positive as well as more chances that people could get sick enough to require medical care. “We have got to be careful about that, because, even if you have a less of a percentage of severity, when you have multi-multi-multi-fold more people getting infected, the net amount is you’re still going to get a lot of people that are going to be needing hospitalization,” Dr. Fauci said.  Hospitals in several states are showing signs of strain and experiencing staffing shortages. “At the moment, the major concern is the effect of Omicron on hospital staffing in conjunction with fatigue and increasing admissions for Covid-19 as well as other things,” said Julio Figueroa, chief of infectious diseases at the Louisiana State School Health Sciences Center.  Hawaii has requested 700 additional health care workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, while some hospitals in the St. Louis area have started to limit visitors again. Leaders in Illinois have urged hospitals to postpone elective surgeries and procedures. The Maryland Hospital Association said that the number of hospital patients had surpassed the state’s Covid peak from last winter. “We believe that the next four to six weeks are really going to be a terrible point in this crisis, and it’s potentially going to be the worst part of the whole two-year fight,” Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland said on the CNN program “State of the Union.” Large city school systems in Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee and Newark have joined a growing list of public schools across the country that have postponed reopening after the holiday break, switched to remote instruction, or have taken both steps because of Covid-19 outbreaks and staffing shortages. Some of the announcements came abruptly, as school leaders struggled to respond to a rapidly changing situation. Some school systems that are open for in-person instruction this week have nonetheless had to shut some school buildings for lack of staff, including eight schools in Columbus, Ohio, and 12 in Pittsburgh. An increasing number of people with compromised immune systems in the U.S. are sidestepping government guidelines to receive unauthorized fourth or fifth shots. The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are in charge of determining when additional doses should be administered, but some patients and their doctors feel that federal agencies have acted too slowly to protect the most vulnerable. Israel has already begun officially offering fourth shots — Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announced on Sunday that the country would offer additional shots to people age 60 and over, as well as to medical workers, becoming the first country to start administering an additional booster so broadly. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidelines in late October to say that immunocompromised people would be eligible for a fourth dose six months after a third. For those who followed the rules, the earliest eligibility for a fourth would be in late February. But as new variants like Omicron arise and vaccination rates continue to be sluggish in many areas, worrying those with weak immune systems, many of them are getting extra shots without being certain of whether they are safe or effective. All secondary school students in England must be tested for the coronavirus before returning to classrooms after the holidays, the British government announced on Monday, in the latest measure aimed at controlling a rise in infections driven by the Omicron variant. Schools have been provided with rapid test kits to administer on site when pupils begin returning to classes this week, officials said, adding that students should continue to test themselves at least twice a week. Older students, including those at universities, had already been advised to test themselves at home before returning to campuses. “We are doing all we can to minimize disruption this virus causes to everyday life, including keeping children in school, and regular testing is a key way to support schools and protect face-to-face teaching,” Britain’s health minister, Sajid Javid, said in a statement. Self-administered rapid antigen tests — known in Britain as lateral-flow tests — have become a ubiquitous part of British life over the past year, provided free by the government through the mail and at pharmacies. Over the holidays, however, supply difficulties and surging demand have often made them more difficult to obtain, with officials blaming a “worldwide shortage.” Officials said on Monday that schools would have access to “a separate supply route” to order additional tests. The government also said that English secondary school students, though not their teachers, would be required to wear masks in classrooms until at least Jan. 26. Masks are already recommended for students in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, where separate devolved governments decide on their own Covid measures.  While those governments reintroduced restrictions on gatherings after Christmas, Mr. Javid and other British officials have said that further restrictions on everyday life in England are not necessary because cases of severe illness are not rising as fast as in previous waves.  Even as Britain recorded its all-time highs in daily cases last week, the health secretary said that the country has “some of the least restrictive measures in Europe,” and argued that high vaccination rates, including a scaled-up booster program, would allow Britons to live with the virus. “Curbs on our freedom must be an absolute last resort and the British people rightly expect us to do everything in our power to avert them,” Mr. Javid wrote in The Daily Mail newspaper on Friday. Data released by British health officials last week added to findings that Omicron might produce less severe illness than previous variants. Still, some experts warned that the sheer number of cases would strain Britain’s health system. Government data showed a 50 percent rise in both hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19 over the past week, with nearly 1,000 people having died within 28 days of a positive test. As of Monday, South Korea’s vaccine passes will have a six-month expiration date, as the health authorities seek to manage the country’s “living with Covid” strategy. Under the vaccine pass system, which started in mid-December, visitors to public places like restaurants, cafes, sports facilities and movie theaters must present proof of vaccination to gain access. (Proof of a recent negative P.C.R. test is also accepted.) With the tightened rules, those who received two doses of the coronavirus vaccine must get a booster shot within six months, or their vaccine passes — issued 14 days after getting a second dose — will be void. (Negative test results issued within 48 hours will still be accepted.) Fines or administrative action against violators will begin starting on Jan. 10, according to Yonhap News Agency. Both people who flout the rule and venues that fail to enforce it could face punishment. The vaccine pass system has spurred debate in South Korea over whether it is forcing people to take the vaccine. The country has fully vaccinated 83 percent of its population, according to Our World in Data, and on Monday Korean health officials reported 3,129 new daily cases of the virus. After weeks of record-breaking case counts, the country has had a 34 percent drop in daily cases over the past week. Other countries have also begun adding expiration dates to a primary vaccine regimen. Starting in February, the European Union Covid Certificate will have a validity period of nine months, and booster shots will be mandatory for travel across several countries on the continent. And beginning next week, the United Arab Emirates is set to bar people from leaving the country unless they have received three doses of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the state news agency WAM. Britain announced a goal to administer boosters to all adults by the end of the month, and Israel last week approved of a fourth shot for people with weak immune systems and others at high risk, including those 60 and over, and health care workers. The United States has been slower in its booster rollout, with only one-third of fully vaccinated adults receiving another shot as of mid-December. Chile will also offer its eligible residents a fourth coronavirus vaccine dose from February, President Sebastián Piñera announced. Health care workers, older people and those with chronic diseases would be given shots first. Vietnam has urged China, one of its major trading partners, to ease the measures local Chinese officials put in place at a key border crossing to fight the coronavirus, saying that the restrictions were leading to congestion and stranding thousands of trucks with goods. Earlier this month officials in Guangxi, an autonomous region in southern China, moved to curb rising coronavirus cases by enforcing more stringent border rules, such as extra checkpoints, mass testing and 24-hour security patrols, and suspending border gate operations and fruit imports. Those measures have disrupted supply chains in Vietnam, “adversely impacted the bilateral trade and caused great losses to businesses and people of both sides,” according to the state-run Vietnam News Agency. Vietnamese and Chinese trade officials held talks online and by phone to address the congestion late last month, V.N.A. reported. Vietnamese officials suggested “restoring customs clearance at the border gates and increasing the time for customs clearance,” the agency reported. Guangxi officials said they would ease customs clearance and convey other proposals to more senior officials, according to local news outlets. Fruit exports from Thailand to China — such as durians and longans — have also been held up by the tightened controls at Guangxi, Thai officials said in a statement on Sunday. After urgent talks with Thai officials, the Chinese authorities agreed to open another land checkpoint, the Pingxiang railway crossing in Guangxi, to allow Thai fruit into the country starting Tuesday, according to the Thai Office of Agricultural Affairs at Guangzhou. Drivers, cars and goods must be free of contamination or the Chinese authorities will immediately close the checkpoint again, Thai officials said. More than two million tons of Thai fruit worth $4.4 billion were exported to China from January to October 2021. As a surge of coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant takes a growing toll on live performance, the Public Theater announced recently that it would cancel its Under the Radar festival, originally scheduled to begin on Jan. 12. In a statement, the theater cited “multiple disruptions related to the rapid community spread of the Omicron variant,” including effects on staff availability, cancellations by artists and audience members, flight interruptions and visa processing delays. Mark Russell, the festival’s director, said in a video interview that his team had worked on plans to streamline Under the Radar — the Public’s annual showcase for experimental work, and one of several New York festivals that have formed around the Association of Performing Arts Professionals conference — so that it could proceed despite the surge. But on Thursday morning, Russell said, he took stock of the test positivity rate and number of cases in New York, and decided it would be irresponsible to press on. “It was not a time for a festival,” he said. “A festival is a celebration. It’s supposed to be a coming together to celebrate this work, and it was not going to be a celebration.” New York City is doubling the capacity of its free quarantine hotel program for people with the coronavirus, the agency that runs the program said Monday, after complaints from people who said their attempts to get a room through a city hotline met with endless waits on hold and delays of days for the rooms themselves. A spokesman for the city’s Test and Trace Corps, which runs the quarantine program, said in an email Monday, “We will have nearly a thousand beds available this week, and will continue to scale as needed.” The city has also been dealing with problems in a separate quarantine hotel program for people in homeless shelters after 11 women with the coronavirus were crammed into one room with just a few mattresses on the floor and some chairs. As the number of new virus cases in the city has skyrocketed, the spokesman, Adam Shrier, said that demand for the hotels had “quickly increased due to the rapidly transmissible Omicron variant.” He said that program had “several hundred beds available,” even as “our work force is suffering the same kind of illness and exposure as our other colleagues on the frontlines.” But he declined to say whether there was a wait for rooms, citing agency policy not to “disclose information about our locations or guests to protect their confidentiality.” Nearly 30,000 people have stayed in hotels since the program started in June 2020. The city calls it “the only free, major hotel isolation program in the country.” But four people who tried to take advantage of the main hotel-quarantine system told The New York Times late last week that they had either waited days before getting a room, given up and paid for one themselves, or been stuck on hold for hours on a city hotline without anyone ever picking up. Others posted on Twitter about long waits. Brittny Gaston of Brooklyn, 26, a medical assistant, said that five days after she requested a hotel room and was not given one, she finally spoke to someone, only to be told that she no longer qualified for the program because she no longer needed to quarantine, even though she still had Covid-19 symptoms and two people in her household had underlying health issues. “I really wanted to cry on the phone,” she said, adding that when she had Covid last February, she was able to get a quarantine hotel room without delay. Inside a homeless shelter in Brooklyn last week, meanwhile, 11 women who had tested positive for the virus were crowded into a small room, two of the women said.  One of the women, Anna Ortiz, who has chronic asthma, heart problems and uses a walker, said she had to sleep on an uncarpeted floor without a blanket or pillow. “I felt like I was being treated like an animal,” said Ms. Ortiz, 51. The city Department of Homeless Services described that situation as an “isolated incident” caused by the nonprofit that operates the shelter, Camba. Isaac McGinn, a spokesman for the Department of Homeless Services, said that Camba staff had not followed proper procedure and that the city had “conveyed to providers and staff the proper process for connecting clients who need it to isolation services to prevent this from happening.” He said that the system had abut 160 vacant beds in isolation units for people who are infected and another 210 beds in quarantine rooms for people who were exposed. A 54-year-old public-school science teacher on Long Island was arrested on New Year’s Eve after being accused of giving a teenager an injection of what appeared to be Covid-19 vaccine without his parents’ consent, the Nassau County police said. The police said that the teacher, Laura Parker Russo, administered a shot of what appeared to be a coronavirus vaccine to 17-year-old boy in her house in Sea Cliff, N.Y. The youth later went home and told his mother, who called the police and said she had not authorized the vaccination. Ms. Russo was charged with unauthorized practice of a profession, the police said. She has been removed from her classroom in the Herricks Public Schools system in New Hyde Park and reassigned pending the outcome of the investigation, schools officials said in a statement. A school website, which has been taken down, said Ms. Russo teaches at Herricks High School. Ms. Russo did not respond immediately to an email sent by The New York Times. She was released after her arrest and is scheduled to appear in criminal court on Jan. 21, the police said. Unauthorized practice of a profession is a felony under the state education law that carries a penalty of up to four years in prison. The majority of states, including New York, require parental consent for minors to receive Covid vaccinations. Some parents have prevented their children from getting inoculated for various reasons, including concerns about possible side effects and safety. Scientists say the vaccines are known to be safe for children 5 and older, and they urge vaccinating them because children can both spread the virus to others and become seriously ill themselves. The spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant has led to an increase in pediatric hospitalizations. And because broad immunity cannot be reached unless minors are vaccinated, federal and state officials hope that more parents will vaccinate their children, especially as many students return to school. Daily reports of new coronavirus cases have quadrupled in Nassau County over the past two weeks, according to The New York Times’s tracker. Hospitalizations in the county have risen 47 percent in that time. Seventy-six percent of Nassau County residents are vaccinated, according to The Times’s tracker, and the rate for 12- to 17-year-olds is only slightly lower, at 72 percent, according to state data. There is no statewide Covid vaccine mandate for schoolchildren in New York. But some private schools require vaccination, and New York City requires it for certain sports and extracurricular activities. In September, Los Angeles became the first school district to mandate vaccines for children 12 and older, with a deadline of Jan. 10, but those plans have since been delayed. The Washington, D.C., Council has voted to mandate vaccines for students 16 and older starting March 1. “This is a major source of tension between what is important for public health and what is important in terms of individual liberties and parental autonomy,” said Denis Nash, an epidemiologist at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. Schools require other vaccines for enrollment, like vaccination against measles. “That’s the big question: Does Covid-19 fall into the same category as some of these other vaccine preventable diseases that we do require for school entry, or does it not?” Dr. Nash said. The Biden administration has largely responded to the near vertical rise in coronavirus cases by pushing for more people to get not only their initial doses of vaccine, but booster shots as well. This week, federal health officials endorsed boosters for youths 12 to 17 who had initially gotten the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The government also changed the definition of “up to date” Covid vaccination to include boosters. But even as the United States has moved rapidly to expand who is eligible for boosters, progress in persuading Covid-fatigued Americans to get them has stalled. About 62 percent of Americans — about 206 million people — are fully vaccinated, according to federal data. But according to a C.D.C. database, only about 35 percent of Americans have received a booster since mid-August, when additional shots were first authorized, even as eligibility has greatly expanded. On Nov. 19, the F.D.A. authorized boosters for everyone 18 and older who had received two doses of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, and on Dec. 9, it authorized boosters of the Pfizer vaccine for 16- and 17-year-olds. Those changes led to more Americans getting boosters, according to the federal database, but that has since leveled off. After the discovery of the Omicron variant in late November, the pace of all vaccinations sped up, but it peaked in early December, and then it plateaued. (Reporting lags around the Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s holidays have affected the daily numbers throughout this period.) Omicron, which is highly transmissible, has shown that it is better at evading vaccines than other variants. But scientists say booster shots can offer substantial protection, especially against severe disease. The United States is averaging a staggering 585,000 cases a day, a record and a 247 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are rising more slowly, up 53 percent in the past two weeks, and a smaller percentage of patients are landing in intensive care units or requiring mechanical ventilation, compared with those in previous waves. Deaths are down by 3 percent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention went even further in encouraging booster shots on Wednesday, when health officials recommended that to remain up to date, people should get three doses of Pfizer’s or Moderna’s vaccines. The agency also recommended that recipients of Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose vaccine receive a second dose, preferably of Moderna’s or Pfizer’s. “There really isn’t debate here in what people should do,” the C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, said in an interview on Tuesday. “If they’re eligible for a boost, they should get boosted.” Still, the expansion of booster shot eligibility has not been met with an equal amount of demand. Dr. Rebekah E. Gee, the former health secretary of Louisiana, chalked up the resistance to boosters to pandemic fatigue. Referring to the pandemic’s many problems, Dr. Gee said some people simply “don’t want this to be there” and are trying to “will it out of existence.”"
179,The New York Times,nytimes,"A federal judge blocked the U.S. Department of Defense from taking “any adverse action” against 35 Navy sailors who have refused to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, arguing that it violated their religious freedoms.",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3HwLBo7%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR37AF9mNjSPQuqkJm4oUyADnaeMs7nSPcXdwYlN-DUwIkI7eKTdve0Im8w&h=AT3kSoy7PGJzV9imQhvAKupcLJU5NsAeydZc1bC7iFqqn7fEj8BNaz2dsNW8A--H_NJnTe7slCjEQX9-bOAz6MOmTxAX_n8ijRhqXvHNf57wy-GbaK6s6d4tWFIQweH57dYcngTHq2dRIaXq3YJf&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT2d_a_EhxBaNKQXyKbrX3b_kXzBDqkJRzz2Fc9X0CuOZdNko-agqV3oIk4LDm-k922h6y3V1_rSgG4xjzcJTgjcuCHuLpN8Y9A0k18Z-1UOYFQpm0rPkUz7jC_XYJLecYVhtBcGWtcMG8bxvwFlC0FxMmjwvefC4Cmb4qYWxXs2ZhQZ,2d,"SAN JOSE, Calif. — Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the failed blood testing start-up Theranos, was found guilty of four of 11 charges of fraud on Monday, in a case that came to symbolize the pitfalls of Silicon Valley’s culture of hustle, hype and greed. Ms. Holmes, who had once promised to revolutionize health care, was the most prominent executive to field fraud accusations in a generation of high-flying, money-losing start-ups. A jury of eight men and four women took 50 hours over seven days of deliberations to reach a verdict, convicting her of three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud by lying to investors to raise money for her company. Ms. Holmes was found not guilty on four other counts related to defrauding patients who had used Theranos’s blood tests. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on three counts of deceiving investors, for which Judge Edward J. Davila of California’s Northern District said he planned to declare a mistrial. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, terms that are likely to be served concurrently. Ms. Holmes, 37, is expected to appeal. A sentencing date is expected to be set at a hearing on the three hung charges next week. While the verdict was read, Ms. Holmes — who had falsely claimed that Theranos’s blood tests could detect a variety of ailments with just a few drops of blood — sat motionless. Then she gathered her belongings and whispered to her lawyer. She went down the row of family and friends in the court gallery behind her, hugging each one before leaving through a side door. “It’s been a long case,” Judge Davila told the jury. “We collectively have been through many things.” Stephanie Hinds, a U.S. attorney, said in a statement that the guilty verdicts reflected Ms. Holmes’s “culpability in this large-scale investor fraud.” The verdict stands out for its rarity. Few technology executives are charged with fraud and even fewer are convicted. If sentenced to prison, Ms. Holmes would be the most notable female executive to serve time since Martha Stewart did in 2004 after lying to investigators about a stock sale. And Theranos, which dissolved in 2018, is likely to stand as a warning to other Silicon Valley start-ups that stretch the truth to score funding and business deals. The mixed verdict suggested that jurors believed the evidence presented by prosecutors that showed Ms. Holmes lied to investors about Theranos’s technology in the pursuit of money and fame. They were not swayed by her defense of blaming others for Theranos’s problems and accusing her co-conspirator, Ramesh Balwani, the company’s chief operating officer and her former boyfriend, of abusing her. They were also not swayed by the prosecutor’s case that she had defrauded patients. On Monday, jurors told the court that they were deadlocked on three of the charges of defrauding investors. Judge Davila pushed them to continue deliberating, but they were unable to agree. The verdict arrived in a frenzied period for the tech industry, with investors fighting to get into hot deals and often ignoring potential red flags about the companies they were putting money into. Some have warned that more Theranos-like disasters loom. In recent years, tales of start-up chicanery, from the bungled initial public offering of WeWork to the aggressive boundary-pushing tactics of Uber, have not slowed the flow of money toward charismatic founders spinning tales of business success. Those downfalls captured the public’s attention, but did not result in criminal charges. Yet the Justice Department under President Biden has renewed its focus on white-collar crimes. “We will urge prosecutors to be bold,” Lisa O. Monaco, the deputy attorney general, recently said in a speech. “The fear of losing should not deter them.” Ms. Holmes’s conviction sends a message to other founders and executives to be careful about their statements to investors and the public, said Jessica Roth, a law professor at Cardozo School of Law and former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. It “shines a light on the importance of drawing a distinction between truth and optimistic projections — and keeping that clear in one’s mind,” she said. Ms. Holmes rose to prominence by mimicking the disruptive change-the-world chutzpah of Silicon Valley heroes like Steve Jobs — a playbook that has turned companies like Apple, Tesla, Google and Facebook into some of the most valuable in the world. In the process, she captured the attention of heads of state, top business leaders and wealthy families with idealistic plans to revolutionize the health care industry. She traveled the world on private jets, was feted with awards and glowing magazine cover stories and lauded as the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire. But she crossed into fraud when she lied about the accuracy, types and number of tests Theranos’s machines could do to raise funding and secure business deals. “That’s a crime on Main Street and it’s a crime in Silicon Valley,” Robert Leach, an assistant U.S. attorney, said in opening statements at the trial’s start. The verdict concludes nearly four months of proceedings that alternated between exhilarating and plodding. There were delays because of a coronavirus scare, a burst water pipeline, technology problems in the courtroom and juror travel. One juror was dismissed for playing Sudoku and another for her Buddhist faith. Crowds of spectators, many of whom followed the Theranos saga via podcasts, documentaries, books and news articles, waited for hours for a spot in the courtroom’s limited seats. Inside, jurors heard from dozens of witnesses and viewed hundreds of pieces of evidence used in support of prosecutors’ argument that Ms. Holmes knowingly misled investors and patients on her rise to fame and fortune. Witnesses included James Mattis, the former defense secretary who sat on Theranos’s board, as well as Lisa Peterson, who managed money for the wealthy family of a former education secretary, Betsy DeVos, and invested $100 million in Theranos. Prominent investors including Rupert Murdoch and Larry Ellison, as well as two former secretaries of state, George Shultz and Henry Kissinger, who sat on its board, were discussed but never called to the stand. The case’s evidence outlined Ms. Holmes’s role in faked demonstrations, falsified validation reports, misleading claims about contracts, and overstated financials at Theranos. Jurors heard recordings and watched videos of Ms. Holmes making inflated or misleading claims about Theranos. Before it shut down in 2018, Theranos voided two years’ worth of its blood tests. It paid to settle several investor lawsuits, as well as fraud charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission. But prosecutors argued that Ms. Holmes’s actions went beyond those punishments — they were criminal. She led investors to lose hundreds of millions of dollars and patients to get unreliable test results, they said. “At so many of the forks in the road, she chose the dishonest path,” John Bostic, an assistant U.S. attorney, said in closing arguments. In her defense, Ms. Holmes’s lawyers tried to discredit testimony from whistle-blowers, attacked investors for not doing more research into Theranos and said Ms. Holmes’s failures were not a crime. Ms. Holmes capped the proceedings by taking the stand. Over seven days of testimony, she alternated between accepting responsibility for certain missteps and deflecting blame for other problems to colleagues. She said she believed that Theranos’s tests worked and had relied on the expertise of more qualified people running the company’s lab. And she used her charisma to sell jurors on the same vision of the future that, years earlier, had helped her win over investors, world leaders and the press. “I wanted to talk about what this company could do a year from now, five years from now, 10 years from now,” Ms. Holmes said. “I wanted to talk about what was possible.” Ms. Holmes’s argument that her optimistic projections were no different than that of other Silicon Valley companies contradicted the government’s evidence, which was consistent with traditional fraud cases, Ms. Roth said. “If other founders and executives are engaged in the kinds of deceit that was alleged and proven by considerable evidence in this case, then they should be concerned,” she said. Most strikingly, Ms. Holmes accused Mr. Balwani of emotional and sexual abuse. The pair dated in secret for more than a decade, even owning an estate in Atherton, Calif., together. Ms. Holmes said Mr. Balwani, who is around 20 years older, controlled every aspect of her life, including her schedule, self-presentation and time spent with her family. She also accused him of forcing her to have sex with him. Mr. Balwani has denied the allegations. That testimony, delivered through tears, threatened to turn the tide against the prosecutor’s case by appealing to the jury’s emotions and painting Ms. Holmes as a victim. But it was a risky strategy, experts have said, particularly since Ms. Holmes did not provide an expert witness to put her accusations in context of the wire fraud charges. Mr. Balwani, known as Sunny, will stand trial this year. He has also pleaded not guilty. Ms. Holmes left the courthouse after dark on Monday, holding hands with her mother and partner. Cameras surrounded them, lighting up the dark sidewalk. As reporters shouted questions, Ms. Holmes avoided eye contact and stared straight ahead. The fraud trial of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the failed blood testing start-up Theranos, began with jury selection on Aug. 31 and opening statements on Sept. 8. In the weeks that followed, jurors heard from 32 witnesses, including Ms. Holmes, in proceedings that featured dramatic allegations of abuse and long days discussing scientific terminology. Here were three of the key moments from the trial. On Oct. 12, prosecutors showed a key piece of evidence: Theranos’s technology validation reports, which bore the logos of the pharmaceutical companies Pfizer, Schering-Plough and GlaxoSmithKline. Theranos had used the reports to solicit investors and woo commercial partners, even though the drug companies had neither prepared nor approved the reports. Prosecutors repeatedly pointed to the documents as a clear-cut example of fraud. On Nov. 23, Ms. Holmes, 37, said on the stand that she had added the logos to the reports. It was the first time she acknowledged any personal involvement in the documents. But Ms. Holmes said she had not intended to deceive anyone. She said that she added the logos to the reports “because this work was done in partnership with those companies and I was trying to convey that.” Ms. Holmes teared up and her voice shook as she accused Ramesh Balwani, Theranos’s former chief operating officer and her ex-boyfriend, of emotional and physical abuse in her testimony on Nov. 29. The bombshell accusations came at the end of her direct examination. Ms. Holmes said Mr. Balwani, who is 20 years older than her, controlled her schedule, criticized her mannerisms and forced her to have sex with him. Mr. Balwani, who faces his own fraud trial next year and has pleaded not guilty, has denied the accusations. Ms. Holmes also testified that Mr. Balwani did not control her interactions with investors, journalists or executives. But, she said, “he impacted everything about who I was, and I don’t fully understand that.” Prosecutors later told jurors to put the abuse accusations out of their minds and focus on the fraud charges instead. “The case is about false statements made to investors and false statements made to patients,” Jeff Schenk, an assistant U.S. attorney and a lead prosecutor, said. “You do not need to question whether that abuse happened.” For Ms. Holmes, everything came down to how the jury interpreted her intent. During prosecutors’ closing argument on Dec. 16, Mr. Schenk argued that Ms. Holmes deliberately deceived investors, patients and advertisers with the pharmaceutical validation reports, faked technology demonstrations and inaccurate marketing materials. ​​“She chose fraud over business failure,” Mr. Schenk said. But Kevin Downey, a lawyer for Ms. Holmes, countered in the defense’s closing argument that she had acted in good faith. He said that Ms. Holmes had believed her employees’ positive feedback about Theranos’s technology, that investors had known their bets were risky and that her statements had been misunderstood. “She believed she was building a technology that would change the world,” Mr. Downey said. Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the failed blood testing start-up Theranos, now awaits sentencing after being found guilty of four of 11 charges of fraud on Monday. Ms. Holmes, 37, left the San Jose, Calif., courtroom through a side door after the verdict was read in the case, which was closely scrutinized as a commentary on Silicon Valley. She was found guilty of three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She was found not guilty on four other counts. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on three counts, which were set aside for later. After the verdict was read, defense and prosecution lawyers discussed plans for Ms. Holmes’s sentencing, the status of her release and the fate of the three hung charges. Judge Edward J. Davila of the Northern District of California, who oversaw the case, said he planned to declare a mistrial on those charges, which the government could choose to retry. The parties agreed that Ms. Holmes would not be taken into custody on Monday. A sentencing date is expected to be set at a hearing on the three hung charges next week. Ms. Holmes can appeal the conviction, her sentence or both. She will also be interviewed by the U.S. Probation Office as it prepares a pre-sentence report. A conference will be held next week on the three counts in which the jury could not reach a verdict.  Each count of wire fraud carries up to 20 years in prison, though Ms. Holmes is unlikely to receive the maximum sentence because she has no prior convictions, said Neama Rahmani, the president of the West Coast Trial Lawyers and a former federal prosecutor. But he said her sentence was likely to be on the higher end because of the amount of the money involved. Ms. Holmes raised $945 million for Theranos during the start-up’s lifetime and those investments were ultimately wiped out. Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the blood testing start-up Theranos, faced 11 counts of fraud for lying to investors, patients and others to raise money and the profile for her company. (An additional charge of wire fraud against a patient was dropped during the trial.) Here’s what jurors decided: For years, the blood testing start-up Theranos was a darling of Silicon Valley. Its founder, Elizabeth Holmes, started the company in 2003, dropping out of Stanford a year later. The promise of Theranos was simple: The start-up would revolutionize health care with cheaper, easier blood tests that took only a few drops of blood to diagnose conditions as varied as prostate cancer and pregnancy. Based on that promise, Ms. Holmes raised $945 million from investors and Theranos signed partnerships with Walgreens and Safeway. At its peak, Theranos was valued at $9 billion. That made Ms. Holmes, who owned a substantial portion of the company, a billionaire on paper. Then in 2015, The Wall Street Journal revealed that Theranos relied on third-party machines for many of its blood tests rather than using its own technology. The implication: Theranos was built atop wildly misleading claims. At first, Ms. Holmes stuck by Theranos. She went on “Mad Money” on CNBC in 2015 and told the host Jim Cramer: “First they think you’re crazy, then they fight you, then you change the world.” But in January 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, notified Theranos that a November 2015 lab inspection had uncovered “deficient practices” that posed “immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety.” In June 2016, Walgreens ended its Theranos partnership, suing the company for $140 million and eventually voiding two years of blood tests. In 2018, Ms. Holmes settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission over fraud charges. She was then indicted by the federal government on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Later that year, with Ms. Holmes no longer at the helm, Theranos officially shut down. As Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the blood testing start-up Theranos, arrived in court for each day of her fraud trial, she was accompanied by an entourage of supporters, including family members and former sorority sisters from her time at Stanford University. Along with her mother, Noel Holmes, another person was a consistent presence for Ms. Holmes at the trial: Billy Evans, her partner. Mr. Evans’s family founded the Evans Hotel Group, a hotel chain in Southern California. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2015 and worked at a tech start-up until early 2019, according to his public LinkedIn page. Not much is publicly known about Ms. Holmes’s relationship with Mr. Evans. The two were first seen together at the Burning Man festival in 2018, the year that Theranos shut down. Mr. Evans and Ms. Holmes, 37, had a child together in July; she often toted a diaper bag in court. Mr. Evans often sat with the rest of Ms. Holmes’s family in their reserved row in the courtroom in San Jose, Calif., occasionally leaning over to confer with Noel Holmes during testimony. He and the other members of Ms. Holmes’s entourage kept to themselves and did not interact with the press or the public. He has declined to comment on the trial. It was Silicon Valley’s trial of the decade. Since opening statements began on Sept. 8, Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the failed blood testing start-up Theranos, has been standing trial in federal court in San Jose, Calif., for 11 counts of fraud (a 12th count was removed). She was found guilty on four counts. Her case has captivated the public — and spawned books, documentaries and even a fan club for Ms. Holmes, 37 — because she was a young female entrepreneur in heavily male Silicon Valley and because she appeared to push the boundaries of start-up culture and hubris to the limit. Her story initially seemed like the stuff dreams are made of. Ms. Holmes dropped out of Stanford University at 19 and founded Theranos, which promised to decipher people’s health problems with just a drop of their blood. The company raised $945 million from famous venture capitalists and from powerful tech and media moguls such as Larry Ellison and Rupert Murdoch. At its peak, Theranos was valued at $9 billion. Ms. Holmes was lauded as one of the youngest self-made female billionaires. But it all came crashing down after a 2015 investigation from The Wall Street Journal found that Theranos’s blood-testing technology didn’t work. Theranos shut down in 2018. Ms. Holmes was on trial over a central issue: Did she intentionally mislead doctors, patients and investors as she sought investments and partnerships? The prosecution spent weeks arguing that she purposely deceived investors and others while knowing that Theranos’s blood tests were often inaccurate and that the company relied on third-party commercial machines. In opening statements, Ms. Holmes’s lawyers asserted that she was simply a hardworking entrepreneur whose failure to achieve lofty aims did not constitute a crime. Ms. Holmes vocally defended herself in the media after The Wall Street Journal’s revelations about Theranos. She continued that stance during her testimony in court. The trial played out inside a courtroom presided over by Judge Edward J. Davila of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, with no live broadcast of the proceedings. After more than three months of testimony, a jury of eight men and four women has decided the fate of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the failed blood testing start-up Theranos, who faces 11 counts of fraud. The jury was chosen over three days in September when nearly 200 Northern California residents were winnowed down into a pool of 12 jurors and five alternates. Given the prominence of this case, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a difficult time selecting an impartial jury. Potential jurors were quizzed about their familiarity with Theranos and its rise and fall, which had been widely covered by the news media and had spawned a book, a documentary and two podcasts. One potential juror, who was a producer at a radio news show, was excused because his job exposed him to the news, while another was excused for having seen a Theranos documentary. Lawyers also screened out jurors whose experiences with domestic abuse could sway their view of Ms. Holmes’s case. The defense had indicated in pretrial filings that Ms. Holmes would accuse Ramesh Balwani, Theranos’s former chief operating officer and her former boyfriend, of emotionally and physically abusing her. The final jury was made up of seven men and five women. But once the trial began, that composition changed. One juror was excused on the second day of the trial because she was not able to change her work schedule. Another was excused in the fifth week because she said her Buddhist faith would not allow her to vote to convict Ms. Holmes. A third was excused after another juror reported her for playing Sudoku while the court was in session. All three dismissals were women. That left the jury at eight men and four women. The largely male composition could work in Ms. Holmes’s favor, legal experts said. That dynamic may be compounded by Ms. Holmes’s testimony of domestic abuse, the experts said. “Women tend to be more judgmental of other women,” said Christina Marinakis, a jury consulting adviser at the trial services firm IMS Consulting & Expert Services. “The men, especially given her age and young appearance, may take more of a fatherly approach.” For seven days, Elizabeth Holmes took the stand to defend herself. Nearly three months into her fraud trial, Ms. Holmes, the founder of the blood testing start-up Theranos, got the chance to testify, starting on Nov. 19. Her defense boiled down to two major themes: Her actions were misunderstood, she said. Others around her — most notably Ramesh Balwani, Theranos’s former chief operating officer and her former boyfriend — were responsible for the company’s failure, she said. And finally, she implied, just because Theranos failed did not mean she had committed fraud. Ms. Holmes’s testimony was among the first times she had told her side of the story about Theranos’s rise and fall. The Silicon Valley company raised $945 million from investors by touting supposedly revolutionary blood-testing technology, but collapsed after those claims were shown to be false. Ms. Holmes, 37, was charged with 11 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She was found guilty on four of the charges. Under direct examination, Ms. Holmes reframed what prosecutors had said were examples of fraud. She said she had personally added the logos of pharmaceutical companies to reports that seemingly validated Theranos’s devices, when in reality the drug makers had recommended against using Theranos’s technology. But she said she had added the logos “because this work was done in partnership with those companies” and had not tried to deceive anyone. She also said she had concealed Theranos’s use of third-party blood-testing devices — but to protect the modifications her company had made to them, so other companies could not copy them. Ms. Holmes also blamed others for Theranos’s problems. She said others had overseen Theranos’s clinical lab and its commercial partnerships. She highlighted positive reports from her senior scientists, saying she had thought the devices “performed well.” Ms. Holmes could not have deceived others about the technology’s shortcomings because she herself believed it worked, her lawyers implied. She especially pointed the finger at one person: Mr. Balwani, who faces trial on similar charges later this year. Ms. Holmes said he had emotionally and physically abused her during their decade-long secret relationship, allegations that he has denied. Ms. Holmes said he had controlled her schedule and diet, kept her from her family and forced her to have sex. Ms. Holmes conceded that Mr. Balwani had not controlled her interactions with investors or others she is accused of defrauding, but said his influence over her had been so deep that she did not know how to quantify it. “He impacted everything about who I was, and I don’t fully understand that,” she said. Who is Sunny Balwani, Elizabeth Holmes’s former right hand at Theranos and her former boyfriend? In her testimony, Ms. Holmes has accused Mr. Balwani of emotionally abusing her and controlling her, suggesting that she was manipulated. Very little is known of Mr. Balwani, including why he is called “Sunny.” His given name is Ramesh, which was what he was called in a handful of stories and news releases in 1999, when he was a dot-com guy. It was also on his divorce papers from a Japanese artist in 2002. By the time he was co-authoring patents at Theranos a decade later, he was simply Sunny. Mr. Balwani’s early career was in software. He was a Northern California sales manager for Microsoft, selling the company’s products to executives at other firms. On Oct. 4, 1999, when the dot-com boom was roaring, he joined a start-up called CommerceBid.com as president. CommerceBid built platforms that enabled businesses to pit suppliers against each other to drive down costs. That idea seemed to have unlimited potential, and CommerceBid did not even make it to its first birthday before it was bought by another company in the space, called Commerce One, for $225 million. A few weeks later, Commerce One, whose shares were publicly traded, was worth $20 billion. Then the collapse came. A recession forced businesses to cut spending, and executives wondered if maybe the technology did not work well in any case. By 2004, Commerce One was worth nothing. It was a routine dot-com rags-to-riches-to-rags story, hardly even remembered among the bigger flameouts of the era. Failure in Silicon Valley has been considered a virtue because it teaches valuable lessons. But it often can be rewarding in its own right. Mr. Balwani made it out with a reported $40 million. He later became the chief operating officer at Theranos and had a romantic relationship with Ms. Holmes, which has been detailed in emails submitted to the court. Mr. Balwani also faces fraud charges, and his case is scheduled to go trial next year. Like Ms. Holmes, he has pleaded not guilty. The government’s case against Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, featured several key pieces of evidence that showed she intentionally deceived doctors, patients and investors in the blood testing start-up. They included: In 2010, Theranos created a 55-page report that prominently displayed the logos of the pharmaceutical companies Pfizer, Schering-Plough and GlaxoSmithKline. Investors such as Lisa Peterson, who manages investments for the wealthy DeVos family, and Walter Mosley, whose clients include the Walton family, testified that the report had helped persuade them to invest in Theranos. The problem? Pfizer, Schering-Plough and GlaxoSmithKline had not prepared or signed off on the report. While prosecutors did not establish that Ms. Holmes created the report, witnesses like Daniel Edlin, a former Theranos senior product manager, testified that she had signed off on all investor material. Theranos spent years discussing with the Department of Defense the possible deployment of its technology in the battlefield, but no partnership materialized. Yet Ms. Holmes told potential investors in a letter that Theranos had signed contracts with the U.S. military — claims that helped persuade them to invest, the investors testified. “We really relied on the fact that they had been doing work for pharma companies and the government for years,” Ms. Peterson said. Jurors got to hear those claims for themselves in a taped shareholder call. “We built the business around our partnerships with the pharmaceutical companies and our contracts with the military,” Ms. Holmes said in the recording. Emails between Theranos employees made up the bulk of the prosecution’s exhibits. Some of the emails showed when Theranos hid device failures, removed abnormal results from test reports and fudged demonstrations of its blood testing. In one case, Mr. Edlin asked a colleague for advice on how to demonstrate Theranos’s technology for potential investors. Michael Craig, a Theranos software engineer, recommended that Mr. Edlin use the demo app, a special setting on Theranos’s devices that said “running” or “processing” if an error had taken place, rather than display the mistake. The app would hide failures from the client, Mr. Craig wrote in an email. “Never a bad thing,” Mr. Edlin replied. “Let’s go with demo, thanks.” From the start, prosecutors have argued that Elizabeth Holmes intentionally deceived investors, doctors and patients as she sought investments and partnerships for Theranos, her once highflying blood testing start-up. In opening statements on Sept. 8, Robert Leach, the assistant U.S. attorney who is a lead prosecutor in the case, laid out the government’s central thesis: that Ms. Holmes courted investors and commercial partners with false claims about her company’s technology and its relationships with pharmaceutical companies and the military. “Out of time and out of money, Elizabeth Holmes decided to lie,” he repeatedly declared. To make that case, prosecutors called 29 witnesses to the stand. They included eight former Theranos employees, six investors, three commercial partners, two doctors and three patients. From a star-studded list of nearly 200 people the government had listed as potential witnesses, the highest-profile person to appear was former Defense Secretary James Mattis, who had served on Theranos’s board. Prosecutors presented evidence to show that Ms. Holmes perpetrated deceit, including that she knew of technology demonstrations that hid Theranos’s failures and was aware the company made false claims of working with the military. They also showed that Theranos had used a report with a pharmaceutical company’s logo to imply it had that company’s backing, even though the firm had not signed off on the report. Investors and partners testified that those claims had helped persuade them to give Theranos their business and money. The prosecution also detailed the dysfunction within Theranos’s lab, which handled the blood tests. Theranos had trumpeted its claim that its tests could discern various illnesses in patients with just a drop of blood. But Adam Rosendorff, one of Theranos’s former lab directors, spent six days on the stand explaining that the tests repeatedly produced inaccurate and irregular results. Other lab directors testified that they had essentially been figureheads; one spent just five to 10 hours at Theranos over his tenure. Daniel Edlin, a former senior product manager and Holmes family friend, testified that Ms. Holmes had signed off on Theranos’s marketing and investor materials. He also said Ramesh Balwani, the chief operating officer and Ms. Holmes’s onetime boyfriend, who is known as Sunny, had deferred to her when the two of them disagreed. “Generally, she was the C.E.O., so she had the final decision-making authority,” Mr. Edlin said. The trial of Elizabeth Holmes had everything: a charismatic, attractive and youthful female defendant; celebrities; sex; vast sums of money; the long shadow of Steve Jobs; lives of real people at risk. If it’s one of the most famous criminal cases ever to come out of Silicon Valley, it also sometimes seems like the only one. Prosecutors in Northern California brought 57 white-collar crime cases in fiscal year 2020. Even after accounting for the effect of Covid, cases have plunged from the peak of 350 in 1995. Not every white-collar case is a tech case or related to start-ups, which means there are only a handful of times each year when someone in Silicon Valley is accused of a crime. There are a lot of complicated reasons for this shortage of courtroom action. A frequent explanation is that it is the fault of a lackluster U.S. attorney’s office in San Francisco. Few prosecutors come to the Bay Area to make their reputations, and those that do — like Robert Mueller 20 years ago — soon move on to better jobs. Mr. Mueller took over the F.B.I. It’s not just a local issue. Fighting white-collar crime has been less of a priority for the Department of Justice since the Sept. 11 attacks brought fears of widespread terrorism. And for all the growing awareness of the power of tech companies, there is little public demand to hold them accountable. When David Anderson stepped down as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California early this year, he did an interview with a radio station. None of the questions from the host or from callers dealt with Silicon Valley. Mr. Anderson, a Trump appointee, had talked about making Silicon Valley a priority for his prosecutors. His first public appearance was on a panel titled “White Collar Crime in a High-Tech World.” But he was in office for two years, too few to really make an impact. The district has had an acting U.S. attorney, Stephanie Hinds, since March. Yet another reason is that Silicon Valley is a very rich place. That does not make government prosecutions impossible. But it ensures that top-flight defense attorneys can be brought in, making cases like Ms. Holmes’s neither short nor simple. Finally, there is a sense in Silicon Valley that failure — whether a company that went under or an investment that was lost — is best kept in the family, far away from prosecutors, regulators and the media. Investors are supposed to be sophisticated, and a case like Ms. Holmes’s can reveal just how foolish and naïve they were. The same is true of employees. Better to just forget about anything suspicious than allege fraudulent activity. After all, you wouldn’t want to miss out on the next opportunity. Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the failed blood testing start-up Theranos, surrounded herself with a constellation of moguls, four-star generals, venture capitalists and others during her time running the company. Ultimately, Theranos was undone after whistle-blowers who were concerned that the company was lying about its technology spoke to the media and to regulators. Here are some of the central figures in the rise and fall of Theranos and Ms. Holmes’s fraud trial. In 2018, the United States charged Elizabeth Holmes and her business partner, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, with nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The indictment accused the pair of engaging in a “scheme, plan and artifice to defraud investors as to a material matter.” In other words, they were accused of lying about Theranos’s business and technology to get money. The lies outlined in the indictment included claims Theranos made about its relationship with the military and the status of its partnership with Walgreens. Prosecutors also said that Theranos faked demonstrations of its technology and falsified validation reports from pharmaceutical companies and the financial health of its business. Wire fraud is a felony that carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and potential fines. Theranos also paid a $500,000 fine to settle civil securities fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018. It also settled multiple lawsuits with investors and partners before dissolving that year. Since the criminal indictment, the cases of Ms. Holmes and Mr. Balwani have been separated. Mr. Balwani faces trial next year. Further, some of the charges against Ms. Holmes have been dropped and others added.  She pleaded not guilty."

Warner’s music publishing division, Warner Chappell, announced the agreement on Monday, saying that it encompassed Bowie’s entire corpus as a songwriter, from the material on his 1967 debut album, “David Bowie,” to his final album, “Blackstar,” released just before Bowie’s death in 2016 at age 69. The deal, for more than 400 songs, also includes soundtrack music; the material for Bowie’s short-lived band Tin Machine from the late 1980s and early ’90s; and other works. The price of the transaction was not disclosed, but is estimated at about $250 million. “These are not only extraordinary songs, but milestones that have changed the course of modern music forever,” Guy Moot, the chief executive of Warner Chappell, said in a statement. Warner’s deal, signed late last month, is the latest in a series of huge transactions for music rights, driven by the rising value of music in the streaming age and growing Wall Street interest in music as an “alternative investment.” Last month, Bruce Springsteen sold his work as both a songwriter and recording artist to Sony Music for about $550 million. (The copyrights for recorded music are separate from those for songwriting, which cover the lyrics and melodies underlying any performance or recording of song.) Over the last year or so, other major sales have included the work of Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Tina Turner, Mötley Crüe, ZZ Top and Shakira. Warner’s deal for Bowie’s songwriting rights means it will be the home for nearly all of the star’s music. In September, the company announced another agreement with the Bowie estate giving Warner the rights to release all of Bowie’s recordings since 1968 — although that deal did not include Bowie’s debut, which remains controlled by Universal Music. Last fall, the Bowie estate introduced “Bowie 75,” a “retail experience” tied to what would have been his 75th birthday, with pop-up locations in New York and London featuring immersive audiovisual exhibitions along with clothing, music and other memorabilia for sale.

While there’s a lot that scientists have yet to understand about Omicron, the variant is already causing a rise in new cases that may push some hospital systems to the breaking point. Scientists first recognized Omicron thanks to its distinctive combination of more than 50 mutations. Some of them were carried by earlier variants such as Alpha and Beta, and previous experiments had demonstrated that they could enable a coronavirus to spread quickly. Other mutations were known to help coronaviruses evade antibodies produced by vaccines. Based on those mutations, along with a worrying rise in Omicron cases in South Africa, the World Health Organization designated Omicron a “variant of concern” on Nov. 26, warning that the global risks posed by it were “very high.” Since then, the variant has been identified in more than 110 countries. At the beginning of December, a California resident who returned home from South Africa was identified as the first American infected with Omicron. By Dec. 25, the Centers for Disease Control estimated that it made up 58 percent of all new infections in the United States. Omicron is quickly surging to dominance in many parts of the world, living up to the potential that scientists recognized when it was first discovered. Yes. It is two to three times as likely to spread as Delta. The earliest evidence for Omicron’s swift spread came from South Africa, where Omicron rapidly grew to dominance in one province after another. In other countries, researchers have been able to catch Omicron earlier in its upswing, and the picture is the same: Omicron cases are doubling every two to four days — a much faster rate than Delta. For a closer look at how well Omicron spreads, British researchers also observed what happened in the households of 121 people who had been infected with the variant. They found that Omicron was 3.2 times as likely to cause a household infection as Delta was. Scientists don’t yet know what makes Omicron so good at spreading, but a few clues have emerged from preliminary research. A team of British scientists found that Omicron is particularly good at infecting cells in the nose, for example. When people breathe out through their noses, they can release new viruses. Omicron is also adept at dodging antibodies produced by vaccines and previous infections. Some symptom differences have emerged from preliminary data. For instance, one possible difference is that Omicron may be less likely than earlier variants to cause a loss of taste and smell. Data released last week from South Africa’s largest private health insurer, for instance, suggest that South Africans with Omicron often develop a scratchy or sore throat along with nasal congestion, a dry cough and muscle pain, especially low back pain. But these are all symptoms of Delta and of the original coronavirus, too. It’s likely that the symptoms of Omicron will resemble Delta’s more than they differ. “There’s probably a huge amount of overlap between Omicron and the prior variants, because they are essentially doing the same thing,” said Dr. Otto O. Yang, an infectious disease physician at the University of California, Los Angeles. “If there are differences, they’re probably fairly subtle.” While it likely provides protection against severe disease, immunity from previous infections does little to hinder infections with Omicron. The first clues that Omicron could evade immunity came from South Africa, where scientists estimate that at least 70 percent of people have had Covid-19 at some point in the pandemic. An unexpectedly large fraction of Omicron cases involved people who had previously been infected. When Omicron surged in England, British researchers similarly found that many people infected with the new variant had already survived Covid. The researchers estimated that the risk of reinfection with Omicron was about five times that of other variants. Similar results came from Denmark, where scientists compared more than 2,200 households where someone got infected with Omicron to some 6,300 Delta-infected households. Omicron was 3.6 times more likely to infect people with boosters sharing the same house than Delta. But it was barely more likely to infect unvaccinated people. For a deeper understanding of this increased risk of reinfection, a number of teams of scientists have studied the antibodies produced by people who recover from Covid-19. If they mix those antibodies in a dish with other variants, the antibodies do a good job of preventing the viruses from infecting human cells. But if they mix those antibodies with Omicron, it still manages to get inside the cells much of the time. That means that the mutations carried by Omicron are changing the shape of its surface proteins, where antibodies lock onto the coronavirus. Several studies indicate that full vaccination plus a booster shot provides strong protection against infection with Omicron. Without a booster, however, two doses of a vaccine like Pfizer-BioNTech’s or Moderna’s provide much less protection. (Still, two doses of a vaccine do appear to protect against severe disease from Omicron.) Scientists drew blood from fully vaccinated people and mixed their antibodies with Omicron in a petri dish loaded with human cells. Every vaccine tested so far has done a worse job at neutralizing Omicron than other variants. And antibodies from people who received two doses of the AstraZeneca or one dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccines don’t seem to do anything at all against Omicron. But when researchers tested antibodies from people who had received boosters of Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, they saw a different picture. Boosted antibodies blocked many Omicron viruses from infecting cells. Researchers found a similar response when they looked at people who had been fully vaccinated with two doses after a Covid-19 infection: Their antibodies were extremely potent against Omicron. Real-world studies support the results of these experiments. In South Africa, researchers found that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had effectiveness against Omicron infection of just 33 percent. Against other variants, they found its effectiveness is 80 percent. In Britain, researchers found that people who had received two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine enjoyed no protection at all from infection from Omicron six months after vaccination. Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech had effectiveness of just 34 percent. But a Pfizer-BioNTech booster had effectiveness of 75 percent against infection. Results like these have reinvigorated vaccination efforts and have spurred widespread booster campaigns in many countries to prepare for Omicron surges in the weeks to come. Yes. In a large study of more than a million cases of Covid, British researchers found that people who had received booster doses were 81 percent less likely to be admitted to the hospital, compared with unvaccinated people. The risk of being admitted to a hospital for Omicron cases was 65 percent lower for those who had received two doses of a vaccine. The protection that vaccines afford against severe disease with Omicron is leaving its mark on hospitals. As Omicron fuels a new surge of cases, the people coming to hospitals in New York City are overwhelmingly unvaccinated. Vaccinated people are at risk of infection with Omicron because the variant can evade antibodies produced by vaccines and start multiplying in the nose and throat. But vaccines do more than just trigger the production of antibodies against coronaviruses. They also stimulate the growth of T cells that help fight a particular disease. T cells learn to recognize when other cells are infected with specific viruses and then destroy them, slowing the infection. Scientists are starting to examine the T cells produced by Covid-19 vaccines to see how well they fare against Omicron. Preliminary studies suggest that these T cells still recognize the Omicron variant. This preliminary evidence suggests that Omicron infections cannot get past the T-cell line of defense. By killing infected cells, T cells may make it harder for Omicron to reach deep into the airway, where it can cause serious disease. While Omicron can cause deadly infections in some people, it is less severe overall than the Delta variant. Scientists measure the severity of a coronavirus variant by examining how many people infected by it end up in the hospital. The Delta variant turned out to be substantially more severe than earlier variants. But the reverse is true for Omicron. A British study found that the risk of hospitalization due to Omicron is half that of Delta. When the Omicron variant began surging in the United States, hospitals observed the same reduced risk. Despite record-breaking new cases, new hospitalizations rose at a much slower rate. Although it’s a relief that Omicron is not as severe as Delta, the new variant may still put tremendous strain on hospitals, thanks to its extraordinary contagiousness. The lower severity of Omicron likely has several causes. Many of the people that Omicron is infecting are vaccinated or recovered from previous infections. Their immunity lowers their chances of ending up in a hospital with Covid. But preliminary studies on animals and cells also suggests that Omicron has a different biology than other variants. Its strategy for infecting cells works well in the upper airway, but not in the lungs. Yes. In late December, the Food and Drug Administration authorized two new antiviral pills for Covid, called Paxlovid and molnupiravir. Preliminary experiments indicate that both treatments should work against Omicron. People who are at high risk of developing severe Covid can be prescribed either drug in the first few days after a diagnosis. Another effective treatment is a drug called sotrovimab, made by GSK and Vir. It is a monoclonal antibody that can attach to the Omicron variant and prevent it from infecting cells. Unlike Paxlovid and molnupiravir, which are packaged as pills, sotrovimab has to be given as an infusion in a hospital or clinic. Two other widely used monoclonal antibodies, made by Regeneron and Eli Lilly, won’t work because Omicron is resistant to them. As Omicron comes to dominate the United States, the federal government is scrambling to secure more doses of sotrovimab. Another option for people infected with Omicron is an antiviral drug called remdesivir. Like sotrovimab, it is effective at preventing severe Covid. For people hospitalized with Omicron infections, a wide range of other treatments are also available. For example, a steroid called dexamethasone has been demonstrated to be very effective at reining in lung-damaging inflammation. Researchers are creating mathematical models to figure out what Omicron will do in the months to come. These models, by necessity, are based on assumptions about the variant, and those assumptions may need to be altered as more evidence comes to light. But scientists can already see that Omicron is very transmissible and is adept at evading immune defenses. Even if Omicron does turn out to be milder than other variants, it could still push hospitals to their limits. A smaller fraction of Omicron cases may require hospitalization, but if the number of Omicron cases is much bigger than in previous surges, there will still be more seriously ill patients to treat. And in the United States, those Omicron cases will stack on top of already high levels of hospitalizations driven by the Delta variant. A team of modelers who run a project called the Covid-19 Scenario Modeling Hub issued a statement on Dec. 22 making it clear that even as they fine-tuned their projections, the writing was already on the wall. “The best information we have at the moment indicates the threat posed by Omicron is substantial and imminent, and individuals and governments should be prepared to respond accordingly,” they warned. The warning contains an important message: Disease projections are not carved in stone. The variables can change if more people get vaccinated and practice safety measures in public like social distancing and mask-wearing that help contain the spread. Boosters will create an even stronger wall of defense. When the W.H.O. began to name emerging variants of the coronavirus, they turned to the Greek alphabet — Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and so on — to make them easier to describe. The first “variant of concern,” Alpha, was identified in Britain in late 2020, soon followed by Beta in South Africa. But veterans of American sorority and fraternity life might have noticed that the system has skipped the next two letters in the alphabetical order: Nu and Xi. Officials thought Nu would be too easily confused with “new,” but the next letter, Xi, is a bit more complicated. W.H.O. officials said it was a common last name, and therefore potentially confusing. Some noted that it is also the name of China’s top leader, Xi Jinping. A spokesman for the W.H.O. said the organization’s policy had been designed to avoid “causing offense to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional, or ethnic groups.” Next in line? Omicron. (Here’s how it’s pronounced, and here.)"

But really, we already had a bonus partner: California. The state was dramatic and a handful. But she was gorgeous, and she brought into our lives, through the natural world, all the treasure and magic we’d need. The beaches. The mountains. The clean waves at Malibu. The seal pups at Año Nuevo State Park. This was not just our relationship to California; this was everyone here. The implicit bargain was that California would protect and deliver to her residents the earth’s own splendor. In return, we’d spend a stupid amount of money on housing and tolerate a few hazards. We stowed an earthquake kit in the basement of our tiny house and, even prepandemic, cached boxes of N95 masks under the sink. Why live anywhere else? My human spouse hung photos of El Capitan in the entrance hall. We propped a bright red surfboard against the living-room wall. In hindsight, it’s clear that this romance between California and her citizens was fundamentally unstable, built on a lousy foundation and crumbling for years. But when you’re enmeshed, even the troublesome patterns are hard to see. All Californians tell their stories. Ours, courtesy of privilege (race, education, a house purchased in the 1990s), are mundane. Police escorted us over flaming hills as we tried to return home from backpacking trips. I woke up to texts from friends: HAVE YOU HEARD FROM YOUR PARENTS? ARE YOUR PARENTS OK? after their neighborhood in Napa burned. My parents — thank God — were already with me. Pacific Gas and Electric, California’s largest utility, started turning off power to millions of residents in an attempt not to ignite (more of) the state. We all knew these so-called public-safety power shut-offs were an appalling sign of a diseased empire. You couldn’t just abandon basic functions and duties, could you? But it turns out you can. The dominant story in California these days is that the orange, dystopian smoke-filled sky that blanketed the state on Sept. 9, 2020, was proof that our beloved was corrupted and had been for some time. We were in the midst of the worst wildfire season in the state’s history, and the evident wrongness traumatized us and shook us awake. Living in California now meant accepting that fire was no longer an episodic hazard, like earthquakes. Wildfire was a constant, with us everywhere, every day, all year long, like tinnitus or regret. The dry spring was bad; the dry summer, worse; the dry fall, unbearable. Even a wet winter (if we caught a break from the drought) offered little reprieve. All thoughts, all phenomena, existed relative to fire. Where we are now — January, the fresh and less fire-alarming time of year — should be the moment for us to relax and reassess what we’re doing in California and how to live here well. Yet the rains turn the burn scars into mud slides and allow the next season’s flora, what the foresters call fuel, to grow. Billboards beckon us to Miami. Fantasy communes blossom in Maine. For those of us committed to sticking it out, our relationship task is making peace with smoke. (I should say this exercise is not for everyone. A recent study found that a month of medium-to-heavy wildfire smoke — what much of California experienced over the last few years — increases the risk of preterm birth by 20 percent. As one of the study’s authors told me, “Wildfire is literally making it unsafe to be pregnant in California.”) One afternoon in August I lay on the deck of my friend Kevin’s cabin not far from Mono Lake, in the eastern Sierra Nevada, and told myself that I could love, in some deeply-flawed-but-beautiful kintsugi way, the ash-paste air. Kevin’s cabin is perfect — was perfect. Out in the sagebrush, off a dirt road, next to an aspen-lined creek in the high desert, the cabin has everything and nothing: no electricity, no running water. Just one 10-foot-by-12-foot room with a sliding-glass door onto the epic mountain sky. Each summer — often several times a summer — my family drove over Tioga Pass, crossed the cattle guard up into Lundy Canyon, stripped on the rock beside the swimming hole, plunged into the snowmelt and emerged, elated and cleansed. The light shimmered off the aspen leaves like God’s own disco ball. We felt rich every time we arrived. This year, after I jumped in, I told myself I still felt renewed despite the smoke. That was a lie. The next day we hiked up into Twenty Lakes Basin, where you could cliff-dive and bathe in glacial melt. The world here, too, did not feel OK. The meadows looked dull green from drought and ash. This was not the California I first married, but to be honest, I’m not the same person, either. Time is a beast. Did choosing to stay here mean a life defined by worry, vigilance and loss? Aching and eager to escape my own boring loop of depressive thoughts, I met with Alex Steffen, a climate futurist, on the back patio of a bar in Berkeley. Steffen, a 53-year-old mountain of a man with a crystal-ball-bald pate, hosts a podcast and publishes a newsletter called “The Snap Forward.” The idea behind both is that the climate crisis has caused us to get lost in time and space; we need to dig ourselves out of nostalgia and face the world as it exists. As he explained to me in his confident baritone, yes, California, and the world, are in bad shape. But the situation is not as devoid of hope as we believe. “We have this idea that the world is either normal and in continuity with what we’ve expected, or it’s the apocalypse, it’s the end of everything — and neither are true,” he said. That orange sky in 2020? “We’re all like, Wow, the sky is apocalyptic! But it’s not apocalyptic. If you can wake up and go to work in the morning, you’re not in an apocalypse, right?” The more accurate assessment, according to Steffen, is that we’re “trans-apocalyptic.” We’re in the middle of an ongoing crisis, or really a linked series of crises, and we need to learn to be “native to now.” Our lives are going to become — or, really, they already are (the desire to keep talking about the present as the future is intense) — defined by “constant engagement with ecological realities,” floods, dry wells, fires. And there’s no opting out. What does that even mean? We’re living through a discontinuity. This is Steffen’s core point. “Discontinuity is a moment where the experience and expertise you’ve built up over time cease to work,” he said. “It is extremely stressful, emotionally, to go through a process of understanding the world as we thought it was, is no longer there.” No kidding. “There’s real grief and loss. There’s the shock that comes with recognizing that you are unprepared for what has already happened.” I found Steffen’s sweeping, dark pronouncements comforting. He at least had language and a functional metaphor to describe what was going on. Most of us have dragged our feet and deluded ourselves for too long about the state of the world. While we remain stuck, our world pulled away from our understanding of it. We’ve now fallen into a gap in our apprehension of reality. We need to acknowledge this, size up the rupture, then hurl ourselves over the breach. As we sat there, the bar’s concrete patio filled up with young, busy people and their laptops, their gatherings part of an endless stream of work meetings displaced by the pandemic, individuals trying to make the shapes of their lives as “normal” as possible — the whole premise of which, Steffen argued, was a mistake. The mind-set locks us into defining ourselves as the trapped inhabitants of someone else’s broken world. Relinquishing the idea of normal will require strength, levelheadedness, optimism and bravery, the grit to keep clinging to some thin vine of hope as we swing out of the wreckage toward some solid ground that we cannot yet see. “We’re no longer dealing with a fire regime in the woods that responds to the kinds of mild prevention and mild responses, the sensible responses we have thought about, and that thought alone is a crisis,” Steffen said. “It means the lives we had we no longer have.” How did our fire problem get to this point? (Californians: To live here these days means either knowing all this or refusing to learn. So the primer below will either be a review or something you’ll have a strong urge to skip, but shouldn’t.) One, California has a Mediterranean climate. Much of its landscape evolved with fire as a natural part of the cycle. Which is to say, it needs to burn. Two, colonizers stole the land from Indigenous Californians, who knew how to live well with the ecology and burned vegetation at specific times of the year in part to maintain the health of the landscape and keep themselves safe. Then settlers, with government help, killed native Californians. Now very few people continue those Indigenous practices, and we have not returned land to the tribes. “I truly know almost everybody who has a cultural knowledge of fire, and I could probably count them, including myself, on my two hands,” Don Hankins, a Plains Miwok geography and planning professor at California State University, Chico, told me. This was the same conversation in which he noted that places near him that haven’t burned are just waiting. “In Butte County, we talk about the three remaining green ridges: the ridge I live on, the ridge to the north of me and the one just north of that. Those are the last three places where fire hasn’t been.” Three, the United States Forest Service grew up between World War I and World War II and has since engaged in a forever war with fire. The war analogy is not a stretch. In 1947, Smokey Bear started exhorting citizens, “Only YOU can prevent forest fires!” sounding remarkably like Uncle Sam recruiting YOU to fight for the United States Army. The U.S.F.S. owns more than half of forested California. (The state owns about 3 percent.) For the last 116 years, the agency has practiced an exuberant form of fire suppression, in part because it’s mandated to protect the nation’s forests and rangelands for multiple, sometimes conflicting uses: recreation, watershed health, propping up rural economies. A result is that California’s forests are now stuffed like a hoarder’s garage, with 300 to 400 trees per acre. Pre-U.S.F.S., the number was 30 to 70. You can think of the excess biomass as a huge fire debt. That debt will be paid off, willingly or not. Those three factors lay the basic groundwork. The dangers continued compounding from there. We logged; and then, especially in far Northern California, we mostly stopped logging to protect the spotted owl and other endangered species. This meant that we removed the biggest, most valuable, most fire-resistant trees, old-growth nobles that take centuries to regrow, and left behind whole middle schools of plantation-style stands. These stands tend to burn hotter and send flames up into the canopy. Canopy fire is generally bad. Good fire creeps along the forest floor, clearing out fuel on the ground. At the same time, California’s population exploded: to 39.5 million in 2020 from 3.5 million in 1920. The state also created a gothic regulatory framework that made most urban and suburban housing outrageously expensive, difficult and slow to build. So, people moved deeper into the W.U.I., or wildland-urban interface — the areas where the human-built landscape bumps up against the natural world — often seeking affordable homes. Now Californians are out there, everywhere, nestled among the fuel. The accelerant on this pyre: We’ve spewed, and keep spewing, carbon dioxide and methane into the sky, trapping heat on our planet, making California hotter and drier. The core problem is known as the “vapor-pressure deficit.” There’s not enough moisture in the air. Hot, dry air means hot, dry fuels; hot, dry fuels mean wildfire. Preventing ignitions now takes drastic measures. The culpability of PG&E is hard to fathom. As the planet warmed and the company paid bonuses to executives and dividends to shareholders, it allowed vital equipment to fall into disrepair. Power lines blew down in high winds, setting off fires through huge swaths of the state. This keeps happening. As of this writing, PG&E has pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter. It owes more than $24 billion in damages. The company, finally, has plans to put 10,000 miles of power lines underground — a nice start that will take years. Humans, meanwhile, continue to be careless and set the world aflame. Firecrackers, cars throwing sparks, a rancher hammering a metal stake into a wasps’ nest, expectant parents igniting pyrotechnic devices at gender-reveal parties. “Don’t smoke cigarettes on your hike in the dry grass hills!” one exasperated fire scientist told me. “That’s why we closed state parks.” A result of all this? More fires, with more severity. The acreage itself isn’t bad. We have a backlog that needs to burn; might as well get to it. But the critical dryness along with the pileup of fuels makes many wildfires grow too big, too hot, too fast. This wipes out huge tracts of trees, kills sequoias that are thousands of years old and makes many wildfires impossible to fight. The threat is not just in the woods. California is 33 percent forest, 7 percent grassland and 8 percent chaparral (bushes and shrubs). Those grasses and shrubs are “flashier,” meaning they burn easier and faster. This brings fire into communities, and once fire is in a community, the houses are the fuel. Worst of all (I’m only sort of kidding), plants grow back. This makes “fuels management” a maintenance problem, a Sisyphean chore. We can’t just balance the fire debt and call ourselves good. If we do, we’ll be right back in jeopardy soon. None of this is a surprise. Fire professionals have known for decades that every step of this 18-dimensional disaster was coming. In 2014, the quadrennial review by the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service laid out four scenarios for how the fire landscape might look in a decade or so. Two of the scenarios are “high impact” — bad. They sound far too familiar. Scenario No. 1 — Hot, Dry and Out of Control: Year-round, higher-intensity and more destructive fire spreading into communities that have not seen wildfire in 100 years. “Fire behavior is now so extreme that, because of safety concerns, the community is limited in terms of what fires it can suppress with ground forces alone.” Scenario No. 2 — Suppression-Centric: Forests are more flammable than ever. Thirty percent of the United States population is affected by smoke. This is “driving considerable disillusionment from air-quality concerns and lifestyle disruptions. … The country is a tinderbox and conditions are continuing to deteriorate.” In 2015, the Forest Service’s “Futuring Fire Policy” memo sounded the same. We’re headed for more cataclysmic wildfires. Suppressing fire now just delays the catastrophe. When I called around to fire experts this fall for an update on the situation, the response was grim. People started talking to me about zombie towns in the Sierra Nevada foothills — towns almost guaranteed to incinerate. The darkest statements came from the most knowledgeable people. “I do think that we’re going to have significant community destruction,” one retired senior official told me. “We are going to be playing just a completely defensive game. I don’t know that we will ever get ahead of it until we have so much destruction that we kind of eliminated the problem.” Eliminated the problem. Whole towns burned off the map. I asked Zeke Lunder, the best wildfire analyst that I knew, who should be worried. He rejected the whole premise of the question. Worried? Ha. We’ve passed that stage. We exist in a world of knowing that not everywhere nor everyone will be spared. “We need to accept that there’s going to be a fire,” he said. “It’s going to burn the whole town down. When that happens, let’s have identified a pot of money to buy these 5,000 lots that are in the worst places and we know are never going to be safe. So, let’s buy them and rebuild in a footprint that’s defensible.” I asked if he knew of any towns doing that. He said no. Being a climate futurist is a strange gig. You’re not the practitioner; you’re the rhetorical wizard. Lord knows we need smart people like Steffen to inspire ideas that will help us escape our deadly status quo. But until the transcendent creative geniuses arrive, we also need to work with what exists, even if we know it’s not enough. That means addressing our wildfire problem with what’s dully and bureaucratically known as “forest management.” Forest management is a catchall phrase for a Swiss Army knife of large-format landscaping tools. Relevant to mitigating wildfire risk, those include prescribed fire (burning on purpose, when conditions are favorable, to pay down the fire debt); mechanical thinning (pruning at vast scale); and cutting fuel breaks (creating wide belts of land with few fuels, so fire can’t run across). Increasingly this means partnering with tribes, who have been fighting to reclaim their traditions, as well as their lands. Toward these ends, the State of California is now investing a lot of money in forest management — $1.5 billion for wildfire and forest resilience over the last two years. Nonprofits are funding community projects. Locals are burning and thinning around towns themselves. The federal Build Back Better package included $14 billion, to be spread across the country over the coming decade, with $10 billion specifically for the wildland-urban interface. We’re talking about a lot of trees here. Tens of millions of acres of California are overloaded with fuels. A recent state-federal agreement aims to treat a million acres per year. But we’re never going to clear out the tree hoard through human effort alone. This brings us to one other forest-​management tool in the knife: “managed wildfire.” This one, however, does not always pair well with the other overabundant species out there in California: people. Managed wildfire (perhaps a bit of lexicological wishful thinking) means allowing wildfires to burn for what foresters call “resource benefit,” i.e., the health of the forest. There’s no scientific dispute that this is necessary and good. We’ve got an overstock of trees; we need to work with nature, not against it. But managing, as opposed to suppressing, wildfire sounds terrible to many voters because it requires residents to trade short-term harms (fear, smoke, potential loss of property) for a long-term good (lower risk in the future). If you accept the full scope of the dilemma, the bargain pencils out. But if you don’t acknowledge how dire California’s wildfire situation is, forget it. Managed wildfire is a political nightmare. Tensions between scientists and politicians erupted early in the 2021 fire season, when the Forest Service didn’t bring its full suppression efforts to fight the Tamarack fire. (Several other fires posed more imminent threats, and the Forest Service did not have the resources to fight all of them equally.) In July, that fire got out of control, destroyed 23 buildings and spawned a fire tornado near Markleeville, a tiny unincorporated town. The Forest Service responded by shutting down managed wildfire not just in drought-ridden California but throughout the United States for the rest of the year. Forty-one scientists wrote a letter to the Forest Service’s chief, Randy Moore, arguing that this would only make the wildfire problem worse, which of course he knew. Many of the signatories believed he was caving to political pressure from a local congressman, Tom McClintock, and the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, who was then facing a recall. Condoning houses burning for resource benefit plays poorly in rural districts. A few weeks later, I stood at the Minaret Vista overlook, in Mammoth Lakes, staring down at hundreds of square miles of forested ravines with Stacy Corless. She used to be the executive director of a nonprofit, but in 2015 she became a Mono County Supervisor and last year, the chairwoman of the Rural County Representatives of California. She knows the topography of state fire politics all too well. The town of Mammoth Lakes is “surrounded by national forest,” Corless told me. “Completely surrounded.” The landscape below us was a hiker’s paradise and a wonderland for flames. “The accusation is that people like me have made this quote political, but come on. There’s nothing political about life and death and loss of property and trying to deal with evacuations,” she said. “If you’re a scientist, or if your constituents are the trees, or whatever, yeah, that’s one thing. That’s your job to think of that first. But if it’s your job to think of people. … ” Granted, there’s the baseline problem that our propensity for extractive conquest — our history of ruining anything and everything in exchange for gold, oil, water, land, lumber, you name it — created the need to manage our forests and their fires at all. But this is politics in a discontinuity. You’re governing for the world you and your constituents wish you still lived in, a place you may even believe you still inhabit. But it’s gone. The false sense of long-term stability in these communities is also propped up by what economists call a moral hazard: a situation in which individuals tolerate excessive risk because they know they won’t bear the full cost. Fire protection in the West is a free public good, paid mostly by the federal government, some by the states. Take that benefit away and ask residents and developers to pay for the firefighting they use? Californians would stop deciding to move to the W.U.I. because it’s cheap. Counties would stop approving new developments for the property taxes. Aurora Mullett, an insurance agent in El Dorado County, drove me around the Sierra foothills in the black Mustang convertible she usually shares with her dog. “This is the stupidest [expletive] I’ve ever seen,” she said, waving at a newish subdivision. “This place catches on fire two or three times a year.” Magical thinking serves no one well on the fire front. Close to the still-smoldering burn scar from the Caldor fire, all the houses remained pink from retardant drops. Already, Mullett told me, the El Dorado County supervisors had discussed waiving the ordinances requiring locals to spend the extra money to rebuild to the current wildfire code, just as supervisors in Butte County did after the Camp fire destroyed the town of Paradise in 2018. (The El Dorado supervisors later changed their minds.) Mullett raised her kids up here in these woods. She loves to hike and fish just over the knoll in the Desolation Wilderness. But she has seen too much. She knows nothing we do is enough. She might run for insurance commissioner. Hedging her bets, she also bought some property on a lake in Tennessee. This is the moment in the story where you and I would both like me to introduce a majestic, mood-changing solution, a Gladwellian big idea. This is the best I’ve got: We need to stop thinking a dashing rescuer in a red slicker or yellow fire-​resistant shirt should come save us from wildfire. We don’t fight hurricanes. We don’t fight tornadoes. No one assumes there will be an armed defense from an earthquake or a flood. Instead, we bolt our houses to our foundations. We raise our homes on stilts. Now we, Californians of the Anthropocene, need to grow up, take responsibility and stop expecting to be saved. Kimiko Barrett, who studies wildfire at Headwaters Economics, a nonprofit that aims to make “complex data understandable” so others can make better decisions around land use, helped snap this into focus for me one afternoon. We have, she said, “a home-ignition problem, more than a wildland-fire problem.” So simple, yet such a profound shift. Until we accept this, we’re going to remain deluded and stuck. This is the unsexy part of the marriage that involves the endless trips to Lowe’s. In practical terms, what we’re talking about here is home hardening (the preferred jargon for fireproofing your home from the outside). The details are about as thrilling as moving a stack of firewood farther away from your house. Homes ignite in two different ways: from the fire front (direct flames and heat) and from embers (chunks of burning stuff that blow in the wind). Hardening against embers is relatively easy: Install a fireproof roof; place screens over eaves; clear a “defensible space” (a perimeter with nothing flammable). These measures are also cheap. California spent about $4 billion fighting fires this year. A recent white paper, “A New Strategy for Addressing the Wildfire Epidemic in California,” suggests appropriating $1 billion to retrofit 100,000 homes every year. (Ideally this would target homes built before 2008, when the state began mandating the use of ignition-resistant materials on all new construction in high-fire risk zones.) If all houses in California built before 1995 had been retrofitted to 2012 standards, another 2021 paper found, the state would have saved $11 billion in losses from the 2017 and 2018 fire seasons alone. Alexander Maranghides is a fire-protection engineer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology who has spent the last four years studying the material landscape that allowed Paradise to be destroyed. He’s a details guy. With him, all the emotional clothes-rending and finger-wagging around the climate crisis is gone. In their place: the thrill of facts. He explained that fire exploits weakness, just as water does. If you harden your home 90 percent of the way, and you’re in the path of a high-intensity wildfire stoked by fierce winds, “there’s going to be millions of embers,” and your house is going to burn. “You can harden your home for embers. You put a shed next to your house. An ember lands on your shed, ignites and burns your house,” Maranghides said, walking me through a PowerPoint. “You can do the same with your car. You harden your home for embers. You park your car next to your house. The ember ignites the car. The car burns the house down.” Then your house burns your neighbor’s house down too. Maranghides’s employer is the agency that in 1973 published the America Burning report. That report led to fire-resistant pajamas, a new fire code and the creation of the U.S. Fire Administration. Structure fires in the United States dropped 54 percent between 1977 and 2015. His goal is to do the same for wildfire. “I’m not saying this lightly — it’s not accusatory,” Maranghides said. “It’s not about forest fires. Forest fires will happen, and forest fires will burn out. But whether a forest fire turns into a devastation like Paradise or not has to do with how we build and live.” A look at the California 2022 wildfire budget suggests we have a lot of cognitive work to do. Of the $1.5 billion total, only $25 million is for home hardening. Then there’s the far more radical, D.I.Y., save-yourself-from-wildfire move: choosing to stay and defend your own home. There’s an impeccable logic in the idea that if you’re going to eat meat, you should be willing to kill the animal yourself. Does it follow that if you’re going to live in a high fire-risk zone, you should be willing to stick around and snuff out embers with your own shovel or rake (or, as one man in Mendocino County used, a gallon of milk)? The impulse to defend yourself embodies a certain Western frontier ethos. Is this the kind of bravery required of us now? The Forest Service and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Calfire, are “already admitting that they can’t do this on their own,” Amanda Stasiewicz, a social scientist at Wildfire Interdisciplinary Research Center at San Jose State University, said. “The next question is, Well, then how are we going to do this together? Because as much as long-term partnerships around fuels reduction are fantastic — getting PG&E infrastructure underground, reducing emissions, all that stuff, fantastic — people right now want to know what their options are to keep their lives safe if we continue to demonstrate that we can’t keep up with the pace and scale of the work that needs to be done.” Californians, especially deep in the W.U.I., have many questions: Would it be safe for a bunch of us to shelter on a golf course? There’s an old mining shaft on my property — should we shelter down there? But thinking you want to stay and standing before a fire are two different things, like practicing Lamaze and childbirth. Many of the 173 people who died in the 2009 Black Saturday bush fires in Australia remained at their properties but then panicked and tried to flee when they heard the fires racing toward them. Shortly after the Caldor fire burned over the Sierra crest in late August — the second fire in history to do so; the first was a few weeks before — I drove up to Hayfork, a former-logging-now-cannabis-growing town in far Northern California that, like Mammoth Lakes, is surrounded by national forest. The country was then at what the National Interagency Fire Center blandly calls Preparedness Level 5, meaning red alert, all the country’s wildfire resources maxed out. In California alone, the Dixie fire, which eventually grew to almost a million acres, was then burning, along with the McFarland fire, the Antelope fire, the River Complex fire and the McCash fire. Hayfork sat under smoke from the Monument fire. At the Northern Delights cafe, a science teacher turned pot farmer walked in staring at his phone. A friend had just texted him a photo: hot-pink retardant had dropped over the friend’s cannabis crop. For the last 20 years the former teacher and his family have lived out in the Hayfork woods, across the road from a chunk of Forest Service land, which he described with remarkable good cheer as “a frightening display of fuel management.” He and his wife have a deal: If they can see flames from the house, she leaves with the kids. He stays behind. Their relationship with fire is as intimate as it gets. Sometimes they turn out their lights to sleep and their bedroom glows. In early September, I drove to Tahoe. A veil of smoke from the Caldor fire still hung over the lake. People were water-skiing and paddle-boarding — a vision of a diminished world, neither destroyed nor preserved but decayed. For a few weeks at the end of August, the state had been consumed with fear that the vacation town of South Lake Tahoe, an emblem of the splashy, golden California we all married, would burn. Nobody could believe the fire had run down from the mountains into the lake basin, including all the people who always knew it would. South Lake had survived through a combination of luck (the wind shifted), good local fuels management and an epic firefighting effort, which one expert guessed cost $1 billion. Up on the granite cliffs above Emerald Bay, I kind of broke down. That spot is sublime: the huge blue lake, the huge blue sky, the Sierra crest — a dazzling, heart-stopping vision. But I could also see the scars that remained from the Angora fire, in 2007, and they are hard to comprehend. So many blackened trees standing: dead. These trees are an indictment, a museum of failure. They are not coming back. That night, in Tahoe, it rained. The next morning the sky opened up again as I crossed Donner Pass. At a gas station I read a Twitter thread by the novelist Michael Chabon, a Californian, about nihilism versus existentialism. He’d read a draft of his son’s college essay in which that son tried to imagine his own future. Chabon saw his child fighting “to swim against the rising floodwaters of nihilism all around.” Chabon understood why a person would feel that way about the world, and, in particular, about the world right now. Chabon had felt that way himself once, too. But he also knew, having lived here on Earth for a while, that nihilism is a dead end — no path out. The alternative need not be false hope, or even the belief that the world is not essentially broken and absurd. The alternative is to make your own purpose and meaning, whatever the situation. This is a hard, daily task for all of us, perhaps even a required practice if you’re a professional savior. This November, Thom Porter, the chief of Calfire, announced that he was stepping down after just three years on the job. Before he resigned, he told me that he worried that he had blown it. He had been a forester his entire adult life, defined his job as leaving a safer world for his “kids and grandkids, all of our kids and grandkids.” He thought that he had failed, that we all have failed. “Here’s a grim thought for you,” he said at the end of our call. “Forests, in California, are more resilient than humans are in California.” If we keep doing what we’re doing, the forests will die, then some will regrow. The humans will have to flee California for good. “They’ve done it before,” Porter said of the trees, “and they’ll do it again if we don’t get our act together and figure out how to make sure that California and the West are places where humans can continue to reside.” Across California — across the world — it’s easy, even comforting, to sit in despair. To stay depressed and mired in a state where not that much has truly changed. But nihilism is a failure of imagination, the bleak, easy way out. We need to face the lives before us. We need to name the discontinuity: See, there it is, the tear in the universe created by our fear and greed. What we believed was the present is actually the past. That was Steffen’s message to me in the Berkeley bar. We failed to keep pace with the future. And the longer we sat there, drinking our beers, the wider the gap became. We can’t fix California’s wildfire problem with a big idea. We can only settle into the trans-​​​apocalypse and work for the best future, the best present. That starts with acknowledging that our political structures have failed us and keep failing us every day. The powerful have failed the vulnerable. The old have failed the young. The global north has failed the global south. We have failed one another. It’s a real, grown-up, look-mortality-in-the-eye moment we face. In Tahoe, after coming down from the cliffs at Emerald Bay, I took a walk in the woods with two forest ecologists. They moved to South Lake just before the pandemic began, knowing all the risks. But they love it here. They want to love their lives. For work, they climb and study giant sequoias to see the toll our world is having on them. First, they load a compound bow, then shoot an arrow trailing a fishing line over a tree branch. Next, haul a rope, ascend the trunk and survey a tree’s giant limbs for bark-beetle scars. When giant sequoias have enough water, they expel the beetles with sap. When they don’t, the majestic trees die from the top down. This summer, in Kings Canyon, as the wildfires approached, firefighters wrapped giant sequoias in aluminum foil. This included General Sherman — 2,200 years old and the largest single tree on Earth. This act was meager, and it was devotional. It’s what we’ve got now. The good news is, some of the moves we need to make are easier, more straightforward and more under our control than we imagined, if we’d just allow ourselves to get them done. The bad news is that there is just going to be loss. We’re not used to thinking about the world that way. We’re not used to paying for our mistakes. There is beauty in the sequoia scars, bleeding out sap. And there’s beauty in the sequoias when they have none."

And chances are your doctor has checked you more than once for these risks and, I would hope, offered advice or treatment to help ward off a heart attack or stroke. But has your doctor also asked about the level of stress in your life? Chronic psychological stress, recent studies indicate, may be as important — and possibly more important — to the health of your heart than the traditional cardiac risk factors. In fact, in people with less-than-healthy hearts, mental stress trumps physical stress as a potential precipitant of fatal and nonfatal heart attacks and other cardiovascular events, according to the latest report. The new study, published in November in JAMA, assessed the fates of 918 patients known to have underlying, but stable, heart disease to see how their bodies reacted to physical and mental stress. The participants underwent standardized physical and mental stress tests to see if their hearts developed myocardial ischemia — a significantly reduced blood flow to the muscles of the heart, which can be a trigger for cardiovascular events — during either or both forms of stress. Then the researchers followed them for four to nine years. Among the study participants who experienced ischemia during one or both tests, this adverse reaction to mental stress took a significantly greater toll on the hearts and lives of the patients than did physical stress. They were more likely to suffer a nonfatal heart attack or die of cardiovascular disease in the years that followed. I wish I had known that in 1982, when my father had a heart attack that nearly killed him. Upon leaving the hospital, he was warned about overdoing physical stresses, like not lifting anything heavier than 30 pounds. But he was never cautioned about undue emotional stress or the risks of overreacting to frustrating circumstances, like when the driver ahead of him drove too slowly in a no-passing zone. The new findings underscore the results of an earlier study that evaluated the relationship between risk factors and heart disease in 24,767 patients from 52 countries. It found that patients who experienced a high level of psychological stress during the year before they entered the study were more than twice as likely to suffer a heart attack during an average follow-up of five years, even when traditional risk factors were taken into account. The study, known as Interheart, showed that psychological stress is an independent risk factor for heart attacks, similar in heart-damaging effects to the more commonly measured cardiovascular risks, explained Dr. Michael T. Osborne, a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. But what about the effects of stress on people whose hearts are still healthy? Psychological stress comes in many forms. It can occur acutely, caused by incidents like the loss of a job, the death of a loved one, or the destruction of one’s home in a natural disaster. A recent study in Scandinavia found that in the week following a child’s death, the parents’ risk of a heart attack was more than three times the expected rate. Emotional stress can also be chronic, resulting, for example, from ongoing economic insecurity, living in a high-crime area or experiencing unrelenting depression or anxiety. Bereaved parents in the Scandinavian study continued to experience an elevated cardiac risk years later. How stress damages the heart Dr. Osborne participated with a team of experts led by Dr. Ahmed Tawakol, also at Massachusetts General, in an analysis of how the body reacts to psychological stress. He said the accumulated evidence of how the brain and body respond to chronic psychological stress strongly suggested that modern medicine has been neglecting a critically important hazard to heart health. It all starts in the brain’s fear center, the amygdala, which reacts to stress by activating the so-called fight-or-flight response, triggering the release of hormones that over time can increase levels of body fat, blood pressure and insulin resistance. Furthermore, as the team explained, the cascade of reactions to stress causes inflammation in the arteries, fosters blood clotting and impairs the function of blood vessels, all of which promote atherosclerosis, the arterial disease that underlies most heart attacks and strokes. Dr. Tawakol’s team explained that advanced neuroimaging made it possible to directly measure the impact of stress on various body tissues, including the brain. A prior study of 293 people initially free of cardiovascular disease who underwent full-body scans that included brain activity had a telling result. Five years later, individuals found to have high activity in the amygdala were shown to have higher levels of inflammation and atherosclerosis. Translation: Those with an elevated level of emotional stress developed biological evidence of cardiovascular disease. In contrast, Dr. Osborne said, “people who are not tightly wired” are less likely to experience the ill heart effects of stress. The researchers are now investigating the impact of a stress-reducing program called SMART-3RP (it stands for Stress Management and Resiliency Training-Relaxation Response Resiliency Program) on the brain as well as biological factors that promote atherosclerosis. The program is designed to help people reduce stress and build resilience through mind-body techniques like mindfulness-based meditation, yoga and tai chi. Such measures activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which calms the brain and body. Defusing stress and its effects Even without a formal program, Dr. Osborne said individuals could minimize their body’s heart-damaging reactions to stress. One of the best ways is through habitual physical exercise, which can help to tamp down stress and the body-wide inflammation it can cause. Given that poor sleep increases stress and promotes arterial inflammation, developing good sleep habits can also reduce the risk of cardiovascular damage. Adopt a consistent pattern of bedtime and awakening, and avoid exposure at bedtime to screens that emit blue light, like smartphones and computers, or use blue-light filters for such devices. Practice relaxing measures like mindfulness meditation, calming techniques that slow breathing, yoga and tai chi. Several common medications can also help, Dr. Osborne said. Statins not only reduce cholesterol, they also counter arterial inflammation, resulting in a greater cardiovascular benefit than from their cholesterol-lowering effects alone. Antidepressants, including the anesthetic ketamine, may also help to minimize excessive amygdalar activity and ease stress in people with depression."

Mr. Hamilton, an assistant equipment manager for the Vancouver Canucks, had a small mole there. It measured about two centimeters and was irregularly shaped and red-brown in color — possible characteristics of a cancerous mole, signs that Ms. Popovici had learned to spot while volunteering at hospitals as a nursing assistant. Maybe he already knew? But if so, why was the mole still there? She concluded that Mr. Hamilton did not know. “I need to tell him,” Ms. Popovici, 22, told her parents at the Oct. 23 N.H.L. game between the Canucks and the Seattle Kraken at the Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle. Ms. Popovici typed a message on her phone and waited for the game to end. After waving several times, she finally drew Mr. Hamilton’s attention, and placed her phone against the plexiglass. “The mole on the back of your neck is possibly cancerous. Please go see a doctor!” the message read, with the words “mole,” “cancer” and “doctor” colored bright red. Mr. Hamilton said he looked at the message, rubbed the back of his neck and kept walking, thinking, “Well, that’s weird.” Ms. Popovici said she regretted the message and thought at the time, “Maybe that was inappropriate of me to bring up.” After the game, Mr. Hamilton went home and asked his partner if she could spot the mole. She could. He asked the team doctor if it was worrisome. It was. Then after he had it removed, he waited for the biopsy results to see if the fan sitting behind the team’s bench had been right. Indeed, Ms. Popovici was correct, and she had just saved his life. “She took me out of a slow fire,” Mr. Hamilton said at a news conference on Saturday, his voice quavering at times. “And the words out of the doctor’s mouth were if I ignored that for four to five years, I wouldn’t be here.” Specifically, doctors later told him, it was type-2 malignant melanoma, a type of skin cancer that, because it was detected early, could be easily removed and treated. “With melanoma, just like many other cancers, the success of the treatment or the cure is often dependent on the stage of disease — and the sooner you find something, the better it is,” said Dr. Ashwani Rajput, the director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. Mr. Hamilton recalled the doctor telling him, “I’m going to diagnose you with cancer and I’m going to cure you of cancer in the same phone call.” Once he knew he was fine, Mr. Hamilton asked the Canucks franchise to help him find the woman he described as “a hero.” Mr. Hamilton wrote a letter that was posted on the team’s Twitter account on Saturday that said: “To this woman I am trying to find, you changed my life, and now I want to find you to say THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH! Problem is, I don’t know who you are or where you are from.” It took less than three hours to find Ms. Popovici, who had been sleeping at her home in Tacoma, Wash., that afternoon after working overnight as a crisis intervention specialist at a suicide prevention hotline. She woke up to texts and missed calls from her mother, Yukyung Nelson. “I think she was just shocked,” Ms. Nelson said. Ms. Popovici, who had already planned to attend the game on Saturday between the Canucks and Kraken in Seattle, was invited by both teams to meet Mr. Hamilton. He had just finished a news conference about what had happened. Referring to Ms. Popovici, he told reporters, “My mom wants her to know that she loves her.” Later that afternoon, he repeated the message to Ms. Popovici in person. “It was the sweetest thing when you were talking about your mom,” she told him as they met properly for the first time. At the game, both teams presented Ms. Popovici a combined $10,000 scholarship to use for medical school expenses. “Some people are saying this is not even going to be a drop in the bucket, but trust me, it feels like everything,” she said. “I’m really just so grateful.” She watched the game from the same seat where she had spotted the mole. Everything, she thought, had gone right that day: A future medical student had been sitting close enough to a team bench where an assistant equipment manager was, thankfully, not wearing a jacket large enough to cover the cancerous mole on his neck. “This entire experience has been so rare,” Ms. Popovici said. “And I will just cherish it.”"

Another man who was also in the vehicle was hospitalized in critical condition after the crash, the police said. The storm dropped more than 14 inches of snow in parts of Northern Virginia, while Washington recorded more than eight inches, according to the Weather Service. In central Tennessee and northern Alabama, which caught the tail end of the storm, snowfall totals reached nine inches, the Weather Service said.  The storm was moving north on Monday afternoon through Maryland, Northern Delaware and Southern New Jersey, where snowfalls totals ranged from six to 15 inches. The weather system was expected to pull offshore by about 10 p.m., Andrew Orrison, a meteorologist with the Weather Service in College Park, Md., said. In North Carolina, the storm brought strong winds and snow to the mountains in the western part of the state, while up to two inches of rain fell in Greensboro, Raleigh and Durham, breaking daily records for rainfall set in 1992. As of Monday night, more than 340,000 customers in Virginia were without electricity, while outages affected 43,000 customers in North Carolina and more than 42,000 in Maryland, according to PowerOutage.us, which aggregates data from utilities across the United States. Hundreds of flights from Washington-area airports were canceled or delayed on Monday morning, according to FlightAware, which tracks the status of flights. The Atlantic City International Airport temporarily closed on Monday while crews worked to clear runways of snow, according to the New Jersey Department of Transportation. At a news conference on Monday, Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington said, “I can’t emphasize enough right now that you should stay home.” A snow emergency was in effect for the city until 7 p.m. Monday. Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland mobilized state resources, and Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey declared a state of emergency for five counties, warning residents to stay off the roads. In Delaware, state government offices were closed. At a news conference, Governor Murphy said that as of Monday afternoon, emergency workers in his state had assisted 245 motorists.  “Stay off the roads,” he said. “Let this thing get cleaned up over the course of the evening, and then hopefully get a fresh start commute in the morning.” Roads in the region became treacherous. The Virginia State Police said on Monday that its officers had responded to more than 650 reports of crashes and assisted more than 600 stranded vehicles as of 4 p.m. Some drivers had minor injuries, but no deaths were reported, the authorities said. “The cars are going too fast for conditions, and they’re sliding off the roads, into ditches, into the cement walls, into one another,” said Corinne Geller, a spokeswoman for the Virginia State Police. Rain on Sunday prevented crews from properly salting the roads, she said, making highways more dangerous during the snow on Monday. In Washington, Ms. Bowser said on Monday that residents should stay off the “very slick and hard-to-pass” roads. Crews were working to remove snow from the roads in the affected states on Monday afternoon, after the worst of the storm had passed. Several agencies posted images of cars stuck on snow-covered roads, which officials urged residents to avoid so snow plows could clear the streets. “Stay off the roadways, so our crews can safely do their jobs,” the Maryland Department of Transportation said. Schools across the Washington region canceled classes on Monday, as did several in the Richmond area in Virginia. In New Jersey, some systems announced closures while others said they would operate with delayed openings. The heaviest snow, at two inches per hour, occurred right after the transition from rain on Monday morning, meteorologists said. Mr. Orrison of the Weather Service said that there were reports of thundersnow — a phenomenon when thunder and lighting occur during a snowstorm — in the Washington area on Monday.  The possible refreezing of melted snow in the evening and overnight hours could lead to additional travel concerns. With the possibility of black ice and slick roadways, the Virginia Department of Transportation told residents on Monday night to avoid travel, and the Maryland Department of Transportation told drivers to delay their commutes on Tuesday morning.  “The refreeze on the road could definitely be dangerous for commuters on Tuesday morning,” Mr. Orrison said."

High-risk patients carrying the Delta variant could benefit greatly from two particular monoclonal antibody treatments shown to reduce hospitalization and death. But those medications would most likely do nothing for patients with Omicron, who would only respond to a third antibody treatment that is in very short supply. While U.S. officials have endorsed using a workaround test that can identify Omicron’s genetic signature, experts say it’s not feasible for large health systems facing a crush of patients to employ in each case. That makes treating patients challenging in places like Maryland, where cases are spiking and Omicron accounts for roughly 58 percent of them. The Delta variant is also holding strong in the Great Plains and swaths of the West, including California. While there is no approved test to determine each individual’s variant, a national network of state and other labs use genome-sequencing tests to track variants broadly in communities. Health systems then use those regional estimates or their own data to decide which antibody treatments to use in their clinics and hospitals. Many of them concluded that a community of largely Delta patients would benefit most from the antibody drugs made by Regeneron and Eli Lilly, while communities where Omicron patients are predominant would benefit from antibodies from GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology. Federal officials have dabbled with making the decision for the nation. On Dec. 23, they stopped shipments of antibody treatments by Eli Lilly and Regeneron after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 73 percent of U.S. Covid cases were Omicron. An outcry followed from Republican political leaders, who argued that some people in their states were still infected with Delta. And on Tuesday, the C.D.C. slashed its estimate of national Omicron cases to 59 percent. On Dec. 31, federal officials resumed national shipping all of the antibody treatments. For the next few weeks, as the country grapples with this uneven mix of both variants, tailoring treatments to each patient will be “extraordinarily difficult,” said Dr. Alex Greninger, assistant director of the clinical virology laboratories at the University of Washington Medical Center. Dr. Greninger is credited with developing one of the first tests to detect the coronavirus in the United States. But he is pessimistic that health systems can pivot quickly to sort out which patients have Delta or Omicron. And although a shortcut test can detect Omicron, there’s no simple way to report the results in bulk, he said. What’s more, the genome sequencing used by public health officials takes nearly a week — too long to target the early antibody treatments that have been found to reduce the need for hospitalizations. That makes patient care particularly difficult right now, said Dr. Mark Siedner, an infectious disease clinician and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital. In Massachusetts and nearby states, an estimated 44.5 percent of cases are Omicron. Dr. Siedner said his health system has stopped using the Regeneron and Eli Lilly antibodies that are not effective against Omicron and are “anxiously awaiting” more doses of the effective treatment by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology. “We’re in a holding pattern and it’s a terrible time to be in that place,” he said. Officials across the United States, from President Biden on down, have been insisting that they are no longer in the shutdown business, and will not order any closures to contain the latest surge in coronavirus cases. But Omicron may be taking the decision out of their hands. So many workers are testing positive or calling in sick that businesses, schools, government agencies and more are being crippled by staff shortages that may force them to close some operations anyway. Airlines began canceling flights in large numbers on Christmas Eve for lack of crews, and the problems have continued into the new year. Broadway shows have been canceled because of outbreaks backstage. Major companies have delayed or entirely jettisoned return-to-office plans. Many colleges are switching back to virtual classes to start the semester. And public school leaders are struggling to respond to a situation that has changed greatly from when students went on holiday breaks before Christmas, barely a week ago. Four large city school systems — Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Newark — have joined a growing list of public schools around the country that put off reopening on Monday, switched to remote instruction, or both. Covid-19 outbreaks and staffing shortages forced their hands. Omicron has driven case numbers to staggering new heights: The United States is averaging more than 484,600 daily cases over the past week, a 238 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are up 41 percent in the past two weeks, while deaths are down by 3 percent. In some cases, the very resources needed to cope with Omicron’s staffing disruptions are themselves being disrupted, from the call-center agents who rebook canceled flights to the frontline medical professionals who care for sick workers. Infected police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and transit workers are leaving shifts unfilled. In New York City, subway lines have been delayed by staff shortages, and the Fire Department has asked residents not to call 911 except in a real emergency. Many elected leaders of both parties have discarded their sharpest pandemic-curbing tools, like closing government offices, schools and businesses, which have come with staggering economic, social and political costs. Instead, elected officials have stressed the importance of vaccination, booster shots and mask-wearing. “I am not prepared to shut down schools or the economy at this time,” Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York, a Democrat, said before New York suffered a string of new daily case records last week. “I will not overreact and send this economy spiraling out of control once again.” Many leading public health experts aren’t seeking shutdowns, either. If anything, many appear to be taking an opposite tack. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced new guidelines to help schools stay open, by allowing children who are exposed to the coronavirus to “test to stay” instead of automatically having to quarantine at home. And it has said that some Americans who test positive can leave isolation after five days, half as long as previous recommendations. A federal judge granted a preliminary injunction on Monday blocking the Department of Defense from taking “any adverse action” against 35 Navy sailors who have refused to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, arguing that it violated their religious freedoms. The service members — including Navy SEALs and members of the Naval Special Warfare Command — had filed suit against the Biden administration arguing that their “sincerely held religious beliefs forbid each of them from receiving the Covid-19 vaccine for a variety of reasons based upon their Christian faith.” The Pentagon had mandated that all active-duty troops receive the vaccine. The judge, Reed O’Connor of the Northern District of Texas, effectively blocked the department from punishing those troops. “Our nation asks the men and women in our military to serve, suffer, and sacrifice. But we do not ask them to lay aside their citizenry and give up the very rights they have sworn to protect,” Judge O’Connor wrote in his 26-page order. He added: “The Covid-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no Covid-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.” The group represents a small fraction of active-duty troops from the United States, and as of mid-December, most active-duty soldiers and members of the Navy had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Thousands have requested religious exemptions, and none have been granted so far, officials said in December. The decision follows another injunction by a judge in November against President Biden’s national vaccine mandate for health care workers. Judge O’Connor, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, has reliably tossed several Democratic policies that have been challenged on the federal bench. In response to the injunction on Monday, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, wrote on Twitter, “This is a major win!” A spokesperson for the Pentagon could not immediately be reached for comment. But on Monday evening, John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said that defense officials were reviewing the injunction, according to The Washington Post. The coronavirus is spreading faster than ever at the start of 2022, but the last days of 2021 brought some encouraging news about the latest wave of infections. With growing evidence that the Omicron variant produces less severe illness than in earlier waves, governments are redoubling their focus on vaccinations and boosters, which are increasingly seen as the world’s ticket to “living with Covid.” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert, said on Sunday that hospitalizations, which are not rising as fast, were a more important barometer than reported cases for the severity of the Omicron wave, a sharp distinction after nearly two years of tallying daily case counts. “As you get further on and the infections become less severe, it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations as opposed to the total number of cases,” Dr. Fauci said. Still, the case numbers remain staggering. The world is recording an average of nearly 1.5 million new cases every day, twice as many per day as were recorded nearly a week ago, although the figures in many places may have been distorted by holiday reporting delays. In the United States, experts forecast that the Omicron wave could crest in mid-January, but not before millions were infected every week. Across Europe, caseloads have soared to new highs and ushered in another bitter winter of social restrictions, mask mandates and shifting travel rules. The holidays made things worse as colder weather and festive gatherings drove people indoors, where the virus circulates more easily. Airports and mass transit hubs were snarled with travelers after many people stayed home last year. And with many government offices closed, testing and case data were not being compiled as regularly, leaving officials and experts, at least temporarily, with an incomplete picture of how bad things were getting. As much of the world returns to work this week, however, several trends are becoming clearer: Although many governments are loath to lock down again, officials are tweaking rules to account for Omicron’s blazing spread. Paris last week became the latest European city to reimpose an outdoor mask mandate. South Korea joined France and others in setting an expiry date for its vaccine passes, hoping to push more people to get boosters. Here are some other trends to watch for: Mayor Eric Adams insisted on Monday morning that New York City’s schools would stay open despite an extraordinary surge in Omicron cases. But about a third of city parents did not send their children back to classrooms on the first day after the holiday break. Attendance was just over 67 percent, slightly higher than the low point of 65 percent the system reached on the day before winter break. Throughout the day on Monday, Adams was adamant that the system would remain open. He repeated the message in a series of television interviews and after his first official school visit since taking office on New Year’s Day. “We’re really excited about the opening of our schools,” Mr. Adams said outside the school, Concourse Village Elementary School in the Bronx. “We want to be extremely clear: the safest place for our children is a school building.” Mr. Adams said that remote learning had been disastrous for too many of the city’s nearly one million schoolchildren in the nation’s largest school district, and had been particularly harmful for children in low-income neighborhoods and homeless students. But the calm that Mr. Adams sought to project was not shared by the many parents and educators who greeted Monday morning with profound trepidation. After roughly a year of remarkably low virus transmission in schools, Covid cases soared in the week before the winter break, prompting the closures of 11 schools and over 400 classrooms, and the contact tracing system for city schools effectively collapsed amid the surge. New York City reported 35,650 new virus cases on Sunday, with a 7-day average test positivity rate of nearly 22 percent, according to state data. Some families and elected officials have called on Mr. Adams to delay the start of school by a few days to allow every child and educator to get tested. And teachers have raised questions about how schools will be properly staffed with so many teachers sick with the virus or quarantining due to exposures. “This is an all hands on deck moment,” Mr. Adams said, acknowledging that administrators who are not normally in the classroom would be used to address staff shortages if necessary. Mr. Adams has endorsed a plan created by former Mayor Bill de Blasio that is designed to keep more classrooms open as the surge continues. The plan calls for distributing 1.5 million rapid at-home test kits to schools. Starting Monday, the city is also doubling its random in-school testing program to give P.C.R. tests to 20 percent of consenting children in each school weekly. But most families have not opted in to allow their children to be tested, which has made the testing pool very small at some schools. The mayor and the new schools chancellor, David C. Banks, are betting that their plan to increase testing will prevent major outbreaks. “We’re going to turn those question marks into an exclamation point: we’re staying open,” Mr. Adams said. Mr. Adams and Mr. Banks have so far resisted calls to mandate booster shots for educators or vaccines for children. The mayor has said a decision will be made this spring about mandating vaccines for students for the fall. “We’re not at the point of mandate,” Mr. Adams said Monday, as he encouraged eligible New Yorkers to get vaccinated and boosted. Michael Mulgrew, president of the city’s teachers’ union, said in an email to members that he had encouraged Mr. Adams to start the year remotely. But on Monday morning, Mr. Mulgrew said he was working closely with the new mayor and that schools had been some of the safest places in the city throughout the pandemic. Later on Monday, Gov. Kathy Hochul reiterated her commitment to keeping New York’s children in schools. “My view is that every child should be back in school unless they are testing positive,” she said. The state has distributed 5.2 million at-home test kits to schools thus far, and another 3.8 million arrived yesterday and have yet to be distributed. Under the current rule, test kits will only be provided to students for known exposures that occur in classrooms, although Ms. Hochul said that policy was under review. She also cautioned against a return to remote learning. “The teachers did the best they could. The parents did the best they could,” she said. “But we ask too much.” In particular, she spoke about the effects of remote learning on children in communities of color, those who lacked resources and those without high-speed internet access — an existing digital divide that she said had widened into a “digital canyon.” “We cannot have that,” Ms. Hochul said. “That was an injustice. We cannot have that anymore.” SACRAMENTO — With the Omicron variant raging across California, millions of schoolchildren returned to classrooms on Monday, ending the holiday break as many had spent it — masked, distanced, apprehensive and in long lines with their parents, scrambling for coronavirus tests. Few schools were closed in a state whose Covid-19 precautions have been among the most aggressive in the nation. California has managed to maintain comparatively low rates of virus-related deaths and hospitalizations. But infections have soared recently because of the highly contagious variant, which appears to result in less severe cases. In hundreds of districts, in-person instruction was conditioned on heightened health requirements and fraught with the understanding that even those might not prevent a return to remote learning. “Frankly, the disruption I’m worried about isn’t Day 1 — it’s Day 2, 3 or 4 if we get 30 or 40 or 50 positive cases,” said Alex Cherniss, the superintendent of the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, where, after days of impassioned community debate, some 10,000 students in coastal Los Angeles County returned to class on Monday. “People are exhausted here,” he said. California’s largest school district, Los Angeles Unified, was not scheduled to resume classes until next week. But on Monday, the district issued new rules requiring baseline testing as a condition of returning to campus, regardless of vaccination status. Previously, testing had been optional for vaccinated and asymptomatic students and employees. In many other districts, reopening classrooms on Monday also hinged on fresh rounds of coronavirus testing. In Marin County, students had been given kits to test for the virus before re-entering campus. In Sacramento County, families stood for hours over the weekend at testing sites hastily erected by school districts or took advantage of an infusion of six million take-home tests the state supplied to districts across California as Omicron was starting to spike. “We did two tests at home and he’s fine,” Emily Ramey said as she dropped off her younger child at a middle school in suburban Sacramento. “I’m just hoping that everyone else tested, too.” Los Angeles Unified already conducts the nation’s largest weekly school-based coronavirus testing program, but health officials in the county have ratcheted up other measures that will affect the hundreds of thousands of students and employees in the school system, along with those in private schools and nearly 80 other public school districts. New health rules starting Jan. 1 mandate, for example, that returning students at all of the county’s districts wear face masks not only indoors but also outside at recess, and that school employees upgrade to medical-grade N95 or KN95 face coverings. Gov. Gavin Newsom has reiterated that the state is “committed” to keeping classrooms open and promised last month to make home testing kits “available to every K-12 public school student as they head back to the classroom from winter break.” But not all districts had received their allotment by Monday. San Francisco schools increased mobile testing sites throughout the city and strongly encouraged students to get tested before returning, in part because they will not receive their allotment of tests from the state until later this week. In Palos Verdes, Mr. Cherniss said concern over Omicron almost prompted the district to delay reopening until next week. But when he announced he was considering it, he said, the outcry from parents was fierce. Eventually, the district opted to reopen as scheduled, but to strongly encourage students to test before returning. “We did a big push over the weekend,” he said. “We handed out 2,000 home tests in less than three hours and did another 2,000 live tests. More than 100 were positive.” The top medical official at the U.S. Capitol urged lawmakers and their staff members on Monday to work remotely and take additional precautions against the coronavirus, after the seven-day positivity rate at the building’s on-site coronavirus test center rose rapidly from less than 1 percent to more than 13 percent. In a letter to congressional offices obtained by The New York Times, Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician, informed lawmakers that there had been an “unprecedented number of cases” among hundreds of people who work in the Capitol complex, with dozens testing positive daily. Of the cases detected, 65 percent were symptomatic, the letter said. As of Dec. 15, a majority of the infections were breakthrough cases, with 61 percent caused by the Omicron variant and 38 percent caused by the Delta variant. The building offers daily testing for lawmakers, their staffs, Capitol workers and journalists who work in the building, and lawmakers were among the first wave of eligible people to receive vaccinations and boosters in the country. The breakthrough infections, Dr. Monahan said, had not led to any hospitalizations, serious complications or deaths. “I urge all individuals also to continue essential measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus,” Dr. Monahan wrote in his letter, encouraging lawmakers to maximize the amount of remote work done in their offices and advising all people in the building to use medical-grade masks. With the Senate set to hold votes on Tuesday, Democrats have now decided to meet virtually for their weekly caucus lunch, according to a senior aide. The House is not set to return until Jan. 10. Dr. Monahan has little authority to enforce his guidance, in an institution where individual congressional offices can set their own policies and guidelines. Mask-wearing in recent months has largely been divided along party lines, with two Republicans, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Andrew Clyde, incurring more than $100,000 combined in fines for flouting the mask mandate on the House floor. The Food and Drug Administration on Monday authorized booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds, a group that became eligible for initial shots in May. Regulators also shortened by a month the amount of time that adult and adolescent recipients of Pfizer’s vaccine should wait between their second and third doses, allowing them to seek booster shots five months after their second injections.  And they allowed some children aged 5 to 11 with immune deficiencies to seek a third shot, including those who have undergone solid organ transplants or have conditions that amount to “an equivalent level of immunocompromise,” the agency said in a statement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee is set to meet Wednesday to review the F.D.A. moves and decide whether to recommend the changes. If it does, the C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, is expected to quickly sign off on them.   The F.D.A. said that it examined data from Israel on more than 6,300 people in the 12- to 15-year-old age group who received booster shots at least five months after a second dose. That data “enabled the F.D.A. to reassess the benefits and risks of the use of a booster in the younger adolescent population in the setting of the current surge in Covid-19 cases,” the agency said. The review showed no new safety concerns, including no new cases of myocarditis, a rare heart-related side effect that has been tied to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, particularly in younger men. The condition involves inflammation of the heart muscle. Dr. Peter Marks, who oversees the agency’s division that regulates vaccines, said that the risk of myocarditis was substantially lower after a booster dose than after a second dose, citing U.S. safety monitoring data. The benefits of a third shot outweighed the potential risks, he said, because it may better protect individuals against both the Delta and Omicron variants. Regulators also relied on Israeli data in shortening the interval between second and third doses of the Pfizer vaccine. No new safety issues have emerged in the United States among more than four million people 16 and older who got a third dose at least five months after a second, the F.D.A. said.  Because studies have shown that a Pfizer booster dose increases protection against the Omicron variant, a shorter interval might offer “better protection sooner,” the agency said. Other studies have shown that the potency of two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine ebbs over time.  “We do know that waning has occurred by five months,” Dr. Janet Woodcock, the F.D.A.’s acting commissioner said at a Monday morning news conference at which she and Dr. Marks gave updates on their deliberations about whether to further expand authorizations for Covid vaccines. The F.D.A. has not received sufficient dataon the benefits of a booster shot of Moderna’s vaccine at five months, and so is sticking to the six-month interval for that vaccine. “We will obviously be receptive to data that are submitted to us from Moderna and we’ll take action on those data with all due speed,” Dr. Marks said. He declined to say whether authorization of a third shot was in the offing for those who received one dose of Johnson & Johnson and a second dose of either Pfizer or Moderna’s vaccine. He said the combination appears “to give a very good immune response,” but that more data is needed over time. Asked about booster shots for 5- to 11- year olds, Dr. Marks said that only about a quarter of them have been vaccinated, mostly in the last two months. “It would be great to get a larger percentage of those kids vaccinated, and then we’ll see how many months afterward we need to get them boosted,” he said. No vaccine is yet authorized for children under five. “We certainly understand that there is a pressing need in that age range,” Dr. Marks said, promising that the F.D.A. “will move with appropriate speed with the appropriate data in hand.” Hospitalizations for the coronavirus are rising steeply in New York State, approaching the peak of last winter’s surge and driving the number of deaths reported in a single day above 100 for the first time since last March, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday. Hospitalizations have now surpassed last winter’s peak in New York City, the governor said. She added that there were some signs that this wave of hospitalizations may not be as severe as past surges, but she said the rapid rise was still “a trend that is troubling.” “We’re not in a good place, I’m going to be really honest with you,” Ms. Hochul said at a news briefing in Rochester, as she announced additional testing sites and the arrival of millions of rapid tests to help schools stay open through the virus spike.  Hospitalizations are being closely watched in New York City, one of the first places to be hit hard by the Omicron variant, as a bellwether for the nation as a whole. Omicron was first reported in New York City a month ago, and led to an enormous surge in new cases, from less than 2,500 per day to nearly 50,000 per day on New Year’s Eve. But in the past 10 days, hospitalizations have started to rise even more steeply than cases in New York City, leaping 130 percent between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve, compared to a 60 percent rise in cases over the same period, state data shows. As of Sunday, more than 4,500 people were hospitalized in the city, 500 of them in intensive care units. Statewide, nearly 9,000 people were hospitalized, and 103 people were reported to have died on Sunday. The number of Covid patients in New York City intensive care units is still lower than the peak of last winter’s surge, before vaccines were widely available, when about 750 people were in intensive care. And hospitalizations remain much lower than when Covid-19 first swept the city in spring 2020 and 12,000 people were hospitalized on the worst days, 3,000 of them in intensive care. Unvaccinated people are far more likely to be hospitalized with Covid-19 than vaccinated people, state data shows. In the week ending Dec. 20, the rate of unvaccinated people hospitalized for Covid statewide was 30 per 100,000, compared to a rate of 2 per 100,000 for the fully vaccinated. The hospitalizations are threatening to wear down a health care system whose ranks are already thinned by infections and attrition during the pandemic, and hospitals are readying emergency staffing plans. More than 20 hospitals across the state have been ordered to stop elective surgeries because they lack the capacity to perform them. But Ms. Hochul said that some hospital executives have told her between 20 and 50 percent of their Covid patients are not suffering from severe symptoms, but that they are testing positive in the hospital incidentally, after being admitted for other reasons such as car accidents. As a result, beginning Tuesday, the state will begin to ask hospitals to break down how many patients are being admitted for acute Covid-19 symptoms, in an effort to further decipher this wave’s severity. “I just want to always want to be honest with New Yorkers about how bad this is,” Ms. Hochul said. “Yes, the sheer numbers of people infected are high, but I want to see if hospitalizations are correlated to that.” With schools open in New York City and much of the state on Monday, and masks still optional in certain fully vaccinated settings, some are calling on the city and state to do more to slow the hospitalizations down. Mark Levine, the Manhattan borough president, called on policymakers to immediately urge people to work from home and avoid large gatherings for the next two weeks, as part of a 16-point plan he released Monday. “Hospitalizations in NYC are rising faster than at any point since March 2020,” he wrote on Twitter. “We can’t just accept this. We have to do more to slow this wave.” The Omicron surge has prompted sharp new limits on the number of journalists allowed to attend White House news briefings. The board of the White House Correspondents Association voted on Sunday to limit attendance to 14 reporters, sitting spaced apart in a room with 49 chairs. Three major news agencies will always be represented, two spots are earmarked for major U.S. television networks, and there will be one pool reporter each for print, radio, TV and foreign outlets. The remaining five seats will be rotated on various schedules among 48 news organizations, including The New York Times. The president of the association, Steve Portnoy of CBS Radio, wrote in an email to members, “Given the virulence of the spread, medical experts have once again advised that it would be prudent to substantially reduce the number of people working in the cramped, poorly ventilated work space that we share.” He said that standing in the briefing room’s aisles, a common practice for reporters without assigned seats, “is not welcome at this time” because photographers need room to maintain social distance as they work. The association is also urging its members to stay away from the White House when not on a specific assignment, to minimize the chances of “an outbreak that might limit our ability to cover the president in close quarters,” Mr. Portnoy wrote. “I promise this won’t last a day longer than necessary,” he said in the email, adding that the board would revisit the situation by Jan. 21. As hospitals already strained by the Delta variant threaten to buckle under a crush of patients infected with the even more contagious Omicron, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci said Americans should focus more on the threat the winter wave poses to hospitals and less on the record number of cases. Over the past week, an average of more than 401,200 cases has been reported each day in the United States, tripling from two weeks ago and the first time the number has topped 400,000, according to a New York Times database (new case numbers are slightly depressed because fewer states are reporting after the New Year holiday). Hospitalizations were by comparison up 33 percent, however, to 92,300, while deaths had dropped 4 percent to an average of 1,249 daily. It’s unclear how many hospitalizations are patients infected with Omicron rather than the Delta variant, which scientists believe is significantly more virulent. According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the week ending Dec. 25, Omicron accounted for over 58 percent of new cases versus over 41 percent for Delta. Dr. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, noted on Sunday on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos” that many new infections, especially in people who are vaccinated and boosted, result in no symptoms or mild symptoms, making the absolute number of cases less important than it was for previous versions of the virus. “As you get further on and the infections become less severe, it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations as opposed to the total number of cases,” Dr. Fauci said. That advice is in keeping with what many epidemiologists have said all along. Despite the daily drumbeat of case counts, the number of positive tests has never been a perfect indicator of the course of the epidemic. The number of cases has exploded because the Omicron variant seems to be much more contagious and able to evade vaccines than other earlier variants, which has spurred more widespread testing. What’s more, the official numbers are almost certainly an undercount, because many people are testing positive on rapid at-home tests or carrying the virus without any symptoms. Yet, as Dr. Fauci told Mr. Stephanopoulos, the concern is not so much the mild or asymptomatic Omicron cases as it is the number of people with severe or fatal infections. “The real bottom line that you want to be concerned about,” he said, “is are we getting protected by the vaccines from severe disease leading to hospitalization?” So far, vaccines and boosters appear to be providing that protection. But the unvaccinated remain at risk. “I’m still very concerned about the tens of millions of people who are not vaccinated at all because even though many of them are going to get asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, a fair number of them are going to get severe disease,” Dr. Fauci said. The Louisiana Department of Health tweeted on Sunday that hospitalizations in the state have topped 1,000, and that 76 percent of those hospitalized “are not up to date” on their vaccination status. Also, even if Omicron is milder, as most evidence suggests, a higher caseload means more health care workers who cannot work because they test positive as well as more chances that people could get sick enough to require medical care. “We have got to be careful about that, because, even if you have a less of a percentage of severity, when you have multi-multi-multi-fold more people getting infected, the net amount is you’re still going to get a lot of people that are going to be needing hospitalization,” Dr. Fauci said.  Hospitals in several states are showing signs of strain and experiencing staffing shortages. “At the moment, the major concern is the effect of Omicron on hospital staffing in conjunction with fatigue and increasing admissions for Covid-19 as well as other things,” said Julio Figueroa, chief of infectious diseases at the Louisiana State School Health Sciences Center.  Hawaii has requested 700 additional health care workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, while some hospitals in the St. Louis area have started to limit visitors again. Leaders in Illinois have urged hospitals to postpone elective surgeries and procedures. The Maryland Hospital Association said that the number of hospital patients had surpassed the state’s Covid peak from last winter. “We believe that the next four to six weeks are really going to be a terrible point in this crisis, and it’s potentially going to be the worst part of the whole two-year fight,” Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland said on the CNN program “State of the Union.” Large city school systems in Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee and Newark have joined a growing list of public schools across the country that have postponed reopening after the holiday break, switched to remote instruction, or have taken both steps because of Covid-19 outbreaks and staffing shortages. Some of the announcements came abruptly, as school leaders struggled to respond to a rapidly changing situation. Some school systems that are open for in-person instruction this week have nonetheless had to shut some school buildings for lack of staff, including eight schools in Columbus, Ohio, and 12 in Pittsburgh. An increasing number of people with compromised immune systems in the U.S. are sidestepping government guidelines to receive unauthorized fourth or fifth shots. The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are in charge of determining when additional doses should be administered, but some patients and their doctors feel that federal agencies have acted too slowly to protect the most vulnerable. Israel has already begun officially offering fourth shots — Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announced on Sunday that the country would offer additional shots to people age 60 and over, as well as to medical workers, becoming the first country to start administering an additional booster so broadly. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidelines in late October to say that immunocompromised people would be eligible for a fourth dose six months after a third. For those who followed the rules, the earliest eligibility for a fourth would be in late February. But as new variants like Omicron arise and vaccination rates continue to be sluggish in many areas, worrying those with weak immune systems, many of them are getting extra shots without being certain of whether they are safe or effective. All secondary school students in England must be tested for the coronavirus before returning to classrooms after the holidays, the British government announced on Monday, in the latest measure aimed at controlling a rise in infections driven by the Omicron variant. Schools have been provided with rapid test kits to administer on site when pupils begin returning to classes this week, officials said, adding that students should continue to test themselves at least twice a week. Older students, including those at universities, had already been advised to test themselves at home before returning to campuses. “We are doing all we can to minimize disruption this virus causes to everyday life, including keeping children in school, and regular testing is a key way to support schools and protect face-to-face teaching,” Britain’s health minister, Sajid Javid, said in a statement. Self-administered rapid antigen tests — known in Britain as lateral-flow tests — have become a ubiquitous part of British life over the past year, provided free by the government through the mail and at pharmacies. Over the holidays, however, supply difficulties and surging demand have often made them more difficult to obtain, with officials blaming a “worldwide shortage.” Officials said on Monday that schools would have access to “a separate supply route” to order additional tests. The government also said that English secondary school students, though not their teachers, would be required to wear masks in classrooms until at least Jan. 26. Masks are already recommended for students in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, where separate devolved governments decide on their own Covid measures.  While those governments reintroduced restrictions on gatherings after Christmas, Mr. Javid and other British officials have said that further restrictions on everyday life in England are not necessary because cases of severe illness are not rising as fast as in previous waves.  Even as Britain recorded its all-time highs in daily cases last week, the health secretary said that the country has “some of the least restrictive measures in Europe,” and argued that high vaccination rates, including a scaled-up booster program, would allow Britons to live with the virus. “Curbs on our freedom must be an absolute last resort and the British people rightly expect us to do everything in our power to avert them,” Mr. Javid wrote in The Daily Mail newspaper on Friday. Data released by British health officials last week added to findings that Omicron might produce less severe illness than previous variants. Still, some experts warned that the sheer number of cases would strain Britain’s health system. Government data showed a 50 percent rise in both hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19 over the past week, with nearly 1,000 people having died within 28 days of a positive test. As of Monday, South Korea’s vaccine passes will have a six-month expiration date, as the health authorities seek to manage the country’s “living with Covid” strategy. Under the vaccine pass system, which started in mid-December, visitors to public places like restaurants, cafes, sports facilities and movie theaters must present proof of vaccination to gain access. (Proof of a recent negative P.C.R. test is also accepted.) With the tightened rules, those who received two doses of the coronavirus vaccine must get a booster shot within six months, or their vaccine passes — issued 14 days after getting a second dose — will be void. (Negative test results issued within 48 hours will still be accepted.) Fines or administrative action against violators will begin starting on Jan. 10, according to Yonhap News Agency. Both people who flout the rule and venues that fail to enforce it could face punishment. The vaccine pass system has spurred debate in South Korea over whether it is forcing people to take the vaccine. The country has fully vaccinated 83 percent of its population, according to Our World in Data, and on Monday Korean health officials reported 3,129 new daily cases of the virus. After weeks of record-breaking case counts, the country has had a 34 percent drop in daily cases over the past week. Other countries have also begun adding expiration dates to a primary vaccine regimen. Starting in February, the European Union Covid Certificate will have a validity period of nine months, and booster shots will be mandatory for travel across several countries on the continent. And beginning next week, the United Arab Emirates is set to bar people from leaving the country unless they have received three doses of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the state news agency WAM. Britain announced a goal to administer boosters to all adults by the end of the month, and Israel last week approved of a fourth shot for people with weak immune systems and others at high risk, including those 60 and over, and health care workers. The United States has been slower in its booster rollout, with only one-third of fully vaccinated adults receiving another shot as of mid-December. Chile will also offer its eligible residents a fourth coronavirus vaccine dose from February, President Sebastián Piñera announced. Health care workers, older people and those with chronic diseases would be given shots first. Vietnam has urged China, one of its major trading partners, to ease the measures local Chinese officials put in place at a key border crossing to fight the coronavirus, saying that the restrictions were leading to congestion and stranding thousands of trucks with goods. Earlier this month officials in Guangxi, an autonomous region in southern China, moved to curb rising coronavirus cases by enforcing more stringent border rules, such as extra checkpoints, mass testing and 24-hour security patrols, and suspending border gate operations and fruit imports. Those measures have disrupted supply chains in Vietnam, “adversely impacted the bilateral trade and caused great losses to businesses and people of both sides,” according to the state-run Vietnam News Agency. Vietnamese and Chinese trade officials held talks online and by phone to address the congestion late last month, V.N.A. reported. Vietnamese officials suggested “restoring customs clearance at the border gates and increasing the time for customs clearance,” the agency reported. Guangxi officials said they would ease customs clearance and convey other proposals to more senior officials, according to local news outlets. Fruit exports from Thailand to China — such as durians and longans — have also been held up by the tightened controls at Guangxi, Thai officials said in a statement on Sunday. After urgent talks with Thai officials, the Chinese authorities agreed to open another land checkpoint, the Pingxiang railway crossing in Guangxi, to allow Thai fruit into the country starting Tuesday, according to the Thai Office of Agricultural Affairs at Guangzhou. Drivers, cars and goods must be free of contamination or the Chinese authorities will immediately close the checkpoint again, Thai officials said. More than two million tons of Thai fruit worth $4.4 billion were exported to China from January to October 2021. As a surge of coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant takes a growing toll on live performance, the Public Theater announced recently that it would cancel its Under the Radar festival, originally scheduled to begin on Jan. 12. In a statement, the theater cited “multiple disruptions related to the rapid community spread of the Omicron variant,” including effects on staff availability, cancellations by artists and audience members, flight interruptions and visa processing delays. Mark Russell, the festival’s director, said in a video interview that his team had worked on plans to streamline Under the Radar — the Public’s annual showcase for experimental work, and one of several New York festivals that have formed around the Association of Performing Arts Professionals conference — so that it could proceed despite the surge. But on Thursday morning, Russell said, he took stock of the test positivity rate and number of cases in New York, and decided it would be irresponsible to press on. “It was not a time for a festival,” he said. “A festival is a celebration. It’s supposed to be a coming together to celebrate this work, and it was not going to be a celebration.” New York City is doubling the capacity of its free quarantine hotel program for people with the coronavirus, the agency that runs the program said Monday, after complaints from people who said their attempts to get a room through a city hotline met with endless waits on hold and delays of days for the rooms themselves. A spokesman for the city’s Test and Trace Corps, which runs the quarantine program, said in an email Monday, “We will have nearly a thousand beds available this week, and will continue to scale as needed.” The city has also been dealing with problems in a separate quarantine hotel program for people in homeless shelters after 11 women with the coronavirus were crammed into one room with just a few mattresses on the floor and some chairs. As the number of new virus cases in the city has skyrocketed, the spokesman, Adam Shrier, said that demand for the hotels had “quickly increased due to the rapidly transmissible Omicron variant.” He said that program had “several hundred beds available,” even as “our work force is suffering the same kind of illness and exposure as our other colleagues on the frontlines.” But he declined to say whether there was a wait for rooms, citing agency policy not to “disclose information about our locations or guests to protect their confidentiality.” Nearly 30,000 people have stayed in hotels since the program started in June 2020. The city calls it “the only free, major hotel isolation program in the country.” But four people who tried to take advantage of the main hotel-quarantine system told The New York Times late last week that they had either waited days before getting a room, given up and paid for one themselves, or been stuck on hold for hours on a city hotline without anyone ever picking up. Others posted on Twitter about long waits. Brittny Gaston of Brooklyn, 26, a medical assistant, said that five days after she requested a hotel room and was not given one, she finally spoke to someone, only to be told that she no longer qualified for the program because she no longer needed to quarantine, even though she still had Covid-19 symptoms and two people in her household had underlying health issues. “I really wanted to cry on the phone,” she said, adding that when she had Covid last February, she was able to get a quarantine hotel room without delay. Inside a homeless shelter in Brooklyn last week, meanwhile, 11 women who had tested positive for the virus were crowded into a small room, two of the women said.  One of the women, Anna Ortiz, who has chronic asthma, heart problems and uses a walker, said she had to sleep on an uncarpeted floor without a blanket or pillow. “I felt like I was being treated like an animal,” said Ms. Ortiz, 51. The city Department of Homeless Services described that situation as an “isolated incident” caused by the nonprofit that operates the shelter, Camba. Isaac McGinn, a spokesman for the Department of Homeless Services, said that Camba staff had not followed proper procedure and that the city had “conveyed to providers and staff the proper process for connecting clients who need it to isolation services to prevent this from happening.” He said that the system had abut 160 vacant beds in isolation units for people who are infected and another 210 beds in quarantine rooms for people who were exposed. A 54-year-old public-school science teacher on Long Island was arrested on New Year’s Eve after being accused of giving a teenager an injection of what appeared to be Covid-19 vaccine without his parents’ consent, the Nassau County police said. The police said that the teacher, Laura Parker Russo, administered a shot of what appeared to be a coronavirus vaccine to 17-year-old boy in her house in Sea Cliff, N.Y. The youth later went home and told his mother, who called the police and said she had not authorized the vaccination. Ms. Russo was charged with unauthorized practice of a profession, the police said. She has been removed from her classroom in the Herricks Public Schools system in New Hyde Park and reassigned pending the outcome of the investigation, schools officials said in a statement. A school website, which has been taken down, said Ms. Russo teaches at Herricks High School. Ms. Russo did not respond immediately to an email sent by The New York Times. She was released after her arrest and is scheduled to appear in criminal court on Jan. 21, the police said. Unauthorized practice of a profession is a felony under the state education law that carries a penalty of up to four years in prison. The majority of states, including New York, require parental consent for minors to receive Covid vaccinations. Some parents have prevented their children from getting inoculated for various reasons, including concerns about possible side effects and safety. Scientists say the vaccines are known to be safe for children 5 and older, and they urge vaccinating them because children can both spread the virus to others and become seriously ill themselves. The spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant has led to an increase in pediatric hospitalizations. And because broad immunity cannot be reached unless minors are vaccinated, federal and state officials hope that more parents will vaccinate their children, especially as many students return to school. Daily reports of new coronavirus cases have quadrupled in Nassau County over the past two weeks, according to The New York Times’s tracker. Hospitalizations in the county have risen 47 percent in that time. Seventy-six percent of Nassau County residents are vaccinated, according to The Times’s tracker, and the rate for 12- to 17-year-olds is only slightly lower, at 72 percent, according to state data. There is no statewide Covid vaccine mandate for schoolchildren in New York. But some private schools require vaccination, and New York City requires it for certain sports and extracurricular activities. In September, Los Angeles became the first school district to mandate vaccines for children 12 and older, with a deadline of Jan. 10, but those plans have since been delayed. The Washington, D.C., Council has voted to mandate vaccines for students 16 and older starting March 1. “This is a major source of tension between what is important for public health and what is important in terms of individual liberties and parental autonomy,” said Denis Nash, an epidemiologist at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. Schools require other vaccines for enrollment, like vaccination against measles. “That’s the big question: Does Covid-19 fall into the same category as some of these other vaccine preventable diseases that we do require for school entry, or does it not?” Dr. Nash said. The Biden administration has largely responded to the near vertical rise in coronavirus cases by pushing for more people to get not only their initial doses of vaccine, but booster shots as well. This week, federal health officials endorsed boosters for youths 12 to 17 who had initially gotten the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The government also changed the definition of “up to date” Covid vaccination to include boosters. But even as the United States has moved rapidly to expand who is eligible for boosters, progress in persuading Covid-fatigued Americans to get them has stalled. About 62 percent of Americans — about 206 million people — are fully vaccinated, according to federal data. But according to a C.D.C. database, only about 35 percent of Americans have received a booster since mid-August, when additional shots were first authorized, even as eligibility has greatly expanded. On Nov. 19, the F.D.A. authorized boosters for everyone 18 and older who had received two doses of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, and on Dec. 9, it authorized boosters of the Pfizer vaccine for 16- and 17-year-olds. Those changes led to more Americans getting boosters, according to the federal database, but that has since leveled off. After the discovery of the Omicron variant in late November, the pace of all vaccinations sped up, but it peaked in early December, and then it plateaued. (Reporting lags around the Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s holidays have affected the daily numbers throughout this period.) Omicron, which is highly transmissible, has shown that it is better at evading vaccines than other variants. But scientists say booster shots can offer substantial protection, especially against severe disease. The United States is averaging a staggering 585,000 cases a day, a record and a 247 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are rising more slowly, up 53 percent in the past two weeks, and a smaller percentage of patients are landing in intensive care units or requiring mechanical ventilation, compared with those in previous waves. Deaths are down by 3 percent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention went even further in encouraging booster shots on Wednesday, when health officials recommended that to remain up to date, people should get three doses of Pfizer’s or Moderna’s vaccines. The agency also recommended that recipients of Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose vaccine receive a second dose, preferably of Moderna’s or Pfizer’s. “There really isn’t debate here in what people should do,” the C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, said in an interview on Tuesday. “If they’re eligible for a boost, they should get boosted.” Still, the expansion of booster shot eligibility has not been met with an equal amount of demand. Dr. Rebekah E. Gee, the former health secretary of Louisiana, chalked up the resistance to boosters to pandemic fatigue. Referring to the pandemic’s many problems, Dr. Gee said some people simply “don’t want this to be there” and are trying to “will it out of existence.”"

Apple is still worth more. Apple, the computer company that started in a California garage in 1976, is now worth $3 trillion. It became the first publicly traded company to ever reach the figure on Monday, when its stock briefly eclipsed $182.86 a share before closing at $182.01. Apple’s value is even more remarkable considering how rapid its recent ascent has been. In August 2018, Apple became the first American company ever to be worth $1 trillion, an achievement that took 42 years. It surged past $2 trillion two years later. Its next trillion took just 16 months and 15 days. Such a valuation would have been unfathomable a few years ago. Now it seems like another milepost for a corporate titan that is still growing and appears to have few tall hurdles in its path. Another tech giant, Microsoft, could follow Apple into the $3 trillion club early this year. “When we started, we thought it would be a successful company that would go forever. But you don’t really envision this,” said Steve Wozniak, the engineer who founded Apple with Steve Jobs in 1976. “At the time, the amount of memory that would hold one song cost $1 million.” By just about any measure, a $3 trillion valuation is striking. It is worth more than the value of all of the world’s cryptocurrencies. It is roughly equal to the gross domestic product of Britain or India. And it is equivalent to about six JPMorgan Chases, the biggest American bank, or 30 General Electrics. Apple now accounts for nearly 7 percent of the total value of the S&P 500, breaking IBM’s record of 6.4 percent in 1984, according to Howard Silverblatt, an analyst who tracks valuations at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Apple alone is about 3.3 percent of the value of all global stock markets, he said. Behind Apple’s ascent is its tight grip on consumers, an economy that has especially favored its business and its stock, and its shrewd use of an enormous pile of cash. When Apple unveiled the iPhone in January 2007, the company was worth $73.4 billion. Fifteen years later, the iPhone, already one of history’s best-selling products, continues to post impressive growth. In the year ending in September, iPhone sales were $192 billion, up almost 40 percent from the year prior. The pandemic also sent sales of other Apple devices soaring, as people used them more to work, study and socialize, and sent investors fleeing to the safety of Apple’s stock in an increasingly uncertain global economy. Apple’s immense sales and wide profit margins have provided it with a stockpile of cash big enough to buy a company like UPS, Starbucks or Morgan Stanley outright. At the end of September, Apple reported $190 billion in cash and investments. “They’ve created the greatest cash machine in history,” said Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor who has studied Apple. Yet instead of making a major acquisition, or even trying something ambitious and expensive like building multiple factories in the United States, Apple has decided to largely give its cash back to its investors by buying its own stock. Over the past decade, Apple has purchased $488 billion of its own shares, by far the most of any company, according to an analysis by Mr. Silverblatt. Much of that spending came after Apple used a 2017 tax law to move most of the $252 billion it had held abroad back to the United States. Apple is now responsible for 14 of the 15 largest stock buybacks in any single financial quarter, Mr. Silverblatt said. “They are the poster child,” he said. An Apple spokesman said the company has spent more than $82 billion on research and development over the past five years, steadily increasing its investment each year, and that it employs about 154,000 people, or 38,000 more than five years ago. Apple is also the largest taxpayer in the United States. In April, the company said it had paid $45 billion in taxes over the prior five years. Economists are split over buybacks. Some economists say companies with excess cash should return the money to its shareholders. That it is far better for the economy than sitting on billions of dollars in cash, they say. “This whole notion that buybacks are somehow going into a black hole is mystifying,” Mr. Damodaran said. “That is cash going to investors.” Other economists say that buybacks are largely designed to increase a company’s valuation and that the money should instead be used to invest in the business, raise wages or even cut prices. Apple, for instance, has spent billions of dollars buying its own stock while also using low-wage workers to assemble its products, working hard to avoid taxes and tariffs, and continually raising the prices on its devices. “Apple could have gone and used that money to do all sorts of things. Instead, they’re using it to boost their stock price,” said William Lazonick, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Massachusetts who has been a leading critic of buybacks since the 1980s. Mr. Lazonick said that buybacks increase stock prices by encouraging investors to buy, and then causing momentum in the stock market as other investors look to cash in on the increase. Stock buybacks reduce the number of total shares available for purchase. That makes each remaining share more valuable and improves the underlying fundamentals of the company in equations that large investors and automated trading systems use to pick stocks. As a result, the stock price climbs higher. To Mr. Lazonick, a $3 trillion valuation is the result of a mix of factors. “It’s impossible to know how much of that is speculation, how much is manipulation and how much is innovation,” he said."

The industry ended an already messy holiday season with thousands more flight cancellations as companies struggled to deal with bad weather and keep planes and airports staffed because of a surge in coronavirus infections. More than 8,000 flights in the United States were canceled from Saturday through Monday, affecting more than one in 10 scheduled flights, according to FlightAware, a tracking service. “We had a series of punches that really knocked the industry to the ground,” said Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, a research firm that specializes in the travel industry. The recent cancellations were caused by storms that produced heavy snowfall in the Midwest over the weekend and over the eastern United States on Monday, the worst day of the holiday season with more than 3,000 canceled flights. Southwest Airlines and SkyWest Airlines, which operates regional flights for several major carriers, were responsible for about a third of all cancellations over the weekend and Monday. “Our planners continue their work to anticipate operational challenges today following the winter storm that moved across the country over the weekend, creating a band of heavy winter weather affecting the Baltimore/D.C. area Monday morning,” Southwest said in a statement. The airline has a big hub at Baltimore/Washington International Airport. SkyWest said it was “working nonstop to minimize impact to customers and crew.” Overall, airlines canceled more than 15,000 flights over the 10 days spanning Christmas and New Year’s Eve, or about 7 percent of all scheduled flights. Heavy snowfall and strong winds in the western United States drove cancellations around Christmas. The turmoil throughout the holiday season was exacerbated by shortages of crews as pilots, flight attendants and other workers called in sick with the coronavirus. The disarray comes as airlines pin their hopes on a rebound next summer. The industry is rapidly hiring workers in anticipation of a return to prepandemic passenger traffic — and consistent profits. That recovery rests largely on the hope that the pandemic will be mostly under control and people will be more willing to travel for work and take more international trips. “We still believe that we will get to a very strong summer in the trans-Atlantic” market, Delta’s president, Glen Hauenstein, told investors in mid-December, as the Omicron variant was beginning its rapid spread. Delta plans to offer about 85 percent as many flights across the Atlantic next summer as it did in 2019. For many airlines, the work force expansion was already underway last fall. After they were forced to cancel hundreds of flights when they sought to fly too many flights with too few employees, American Airlines and Southwest cut their schedules and accelerated hiring. American recalled several thousand flight attendants from leave and hired 4,000 new employees in recent months. “We took some very aggressive steps coming out of the summer, building the airline up,” David Seymour, American’s chief operating officer, said in an interview. Southwest has also accelerated recruiting, though executives told investors last month that too many workers quitting and recruits demanding higher wages had slowed the efforts. “The hiring environment is the most difficult we have ever seen,” Gary Kelly, the airline’s chairman and chief executive, said at a December investor conference. Critics say the industry deserves blame for its own troubles. Airlines received $54 billion in federal aid to keep workers employed during the pandemic on the condition that they avoid layoffs. But carriers thinned their ranks anyway by offering buyouts and early-retirement packages to thousands of workers. Most airlines have yet to fully restore their work forces: As of October, the industry employed about 413,000 people, down almost 9 percent from the same month in 2019, according to federal data. Airlines had reasons to reduce staff. Most have struggled to turn a profit consistently because the number of people flying has not fully recovered. The number of passengers who were screened at airports over the past two weeks was down about 15 percent compared with a similar period in 2019. Omicron, of course, poses a threat to the industry, but some industry analysts believe its impact will be short-lived. “It’s put somewhere between, I think, a four- and a six-week standstill in what was the aviation recovery,” said John Grant, a senior analyst at OAG, a firm that provides global travel data. Indeed, millions of people have boarded flights in the United States over the past two weeks, despite the variant’s spread, according to the Transportation Security Administration. But Omicron has made it more difficult for airlines to operate. Even before the pandemic, storms could destabilize an airline’s holiday schedule. This season, the problem was compounded by high numbers of employees calling in sick. “The nationwide spike in Omicron cases has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation,” said United Airlines, which canceled nearly 8 percent of its flights from the day before Christmas through Sunday. “We’re sorry for the disruption and are working hard to rebook as many people as possible and get them on their way.” In a staff memo last week, JetBlue, which canceled 13 percent of its flights over a similar period, said it had received “record-breaking sick calls.” Recent guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could help. Last week, the agency said it recommended that people infected with the coronavirus isolate for only five days instead of 10. Airlines immediately began adjusting policies to recall infected workers more quickly, decisions that met resistance from flight attendants and other employees. “We believe this is the wrong move for aviation as it accepts that infectious people will be put back on the job or flying as passengers on our planes,” Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents nearly 50,000 flight attendants at 17 airlines, said in a letter to airline executives last week. With the holidays over and the industry entering what is usually a lean stretch, airlines should be able to move past the mess of the past few weeks and prepare for the summer. “I think that barring the emergence of another variant that’s as destabilizing as Omicron has been, summer 2022 should be a very good summer for airlines and the rest of the travel industry,” Mr. Harteveldt said."
192,The New York Times,nytimes,"""The experience of the pandemic has shown we are more resilient than conventional wisdom would suggest,"" said George Bonanno, a professor of clinical psychology and the author of a book on the psychology of human resilience.",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3zj6Erv%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0N9UdpDwGZXhcFs3LeN-P3y8k3X81WZiVilAHIV9pviKCm_OvYnpNYEyg&h=AT3rVGD5r_w2YSOeCZpH-ShOEuhCGpx_OzOzUVWndVLsGiJ9ZZKntRKfDWsDYLU6jTxUpLaD2w0NtB1I7KmWjFzZ1x-iNKED2u4Uti6tACExGoW53TTOFV4Ab2yZDJ7yI4qadg3jr44KV-6_1Ljb&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT3zxB6YiIJhe_NLB00d97uGIA8MbXZOWLV42Vm1ItiK3_URto5uiVaEpXSBIYyh9VTYI8Dqreqxtbou_G5Qw7JgNk5G8tQZIkIjf7iJynMc2DM-zR-yP2DWCqnCKmimZbKteXblcnEDzWJCBcxOcJK9eHLkVSUcCLOmj3qmNFszs4rd,3d,"Gov. Kathy Hochul will propose a limit of two four-year terms on New York State governors in her first State of the State address on Wednesday — a move that could allow Ms. Hochul to distance herself from her scandal-marred predecessor, former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who held outsize power for over a decade. The proposal, a milestone that would require a constitutional amendment, would apply only to statewide elected officials — including the lieutenant governor, the attorney general and the comptroller, according to state officials. It would need approval from the State Legislature as well as from voters and could significantly curb the power of the highest office in New York, where recent governors have served for as long as 14 years. New York is one of about a dozen states without term limits for statewide office. Ms. Hochul’s move comes as she runs for a full term and could help her position herself as an advocate for government reform. “I want people to believe in their government again,” Ms. Hochul said in a statement. Her proposal would also bar statewide elected officials from receiving outside income, except if the income comes from teaching. Mr. Cuomo earned $5.1 million for a memoir about the pandemic, and a state ethics board has ordered him to forfeit the money, though that effort has stalled. Past governors have supported term limits, if in name only. Former Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, famously pledged to serve no more than two terms, but ended up running for and winning a third term. Mr. Cuomo had said he supported term limits, but proposed they also be imposed on legislators, knowing that it was highly unlikely that incumbents in the Legislature would term-limit themselves. John Kaehny, the executive director of Reinvent Albany, a good government group, applauded Ms. Hochul’s move, but said term limits should also apply to the Legislature. “Term limits have resulted in a far more racially, culturally and sexually diverse New York City Council and contributed to a dynamism and urgency in city government that is sorely needed in Albany,” he said. Ms. Hochul disagreed, saying in a statement, “The Legislature is most effective with institutional knowledge and should not be subject to term limits.” Her proposal, officials said, would apply to elected terms, meaning she could run for re-election in four years if she wins in November and the amendment were to pass. Carl E. Heastie, the Democratic Assembly speaker, expressed reservations about term limits, saying that he believed voters should decide an elected official’s fate, but adding that he would speak to fellow lawmakers about the proposal. After four months of focusing mostly on the pandemic, Ms. Hochul is expected to use her address on Wednesday, the most important speech of her political career, to delineate her agenda. At stake are the recovery of a state still contending with the pandemic’s economic fallout and Ms. Hochul’s own political fortunes ahead of a June primary. Ms. Hochul, a Democrat from Buffalo who ascended from lieutenant governor after Mr. Cuomo’s sudden resignation in August, has yet to take firm positions on a number of ideological wedge issues in the state, including potential revisions to bail laws. The annual speech will mark the first time that Ms. Hochul, who did not play a prominent role as Mr. Cuomo’s lieutenant governor, will define her policy priorities before a State Legislature still deciphering her ideologically on a range of issues. Shortly after, Ms. Hochul will have to assemble a $200 billion state budget while navigating a contested primary that might push her to the left on some issues — a move that could make her vulnerable to attacks from Republicans during the general election. Indeed, it remains to be seen whether Ms. Hochul will wield her influence as governor to steer the political discourse more toward the center in the State Capitol, where Democrats have enacted a potpourri of left-leaning policies since regaining control of the Legislature three years ago. “So much of her attention has properly been focused on Covid management that where she stands on some broad, more ideological questions is still unknown,” said Senator Michael Gianaris, a Democrat from Queens and deputy majority leader in the upper chamber. One of the most explosive issues likely to come before the Legislature is the bail reform law enacted in 2019, which abolished cash bail except for certain felonies. Democrats have come under increased pressure to roll back parts of the law after Republicans used it as a cudgel to unseat some Democrats in November, arguing that the law had led to the release of dangerous criminals. Ms. Hochul has sidestepped questions about her stance, saying that she would discuss the issue privately with legislative leaders. If she pursues changes, she’ll have an ally who could provide political cover in Eric Adams, the new mayor of New York City, a moderate Democrat and former police captain who supports amending the law. Some lawmakers said there was little appetite among most Democratic lawmakers to alter the law, even as some moderate legislators, especially those in competitive districts on Long Island, have clamored for revisions. State Senator Todd Kaminsky, a Democrat who lost his bid for district attorney of Nassau County last month after his Republican opponent attacked him relentlessly on the issue, said he supported giving judges more discretion in setting bail, though he acknowledged, “There’s no doubt it’s an uphill challenge to change the law.” Time and again, Ms. Hochul has deftly declined to stake out positions on a number of politically charged issues that are considered priorities of the party’s left wing and could give Republicans ammunition against her. She has avoided weighing in on housing legislation known as “good cause eviction” that has gained significant traction and would give tenants a right to renew their leases in most cases and significantly limit how much landlords can increase rents each year. The bill, often used by the left wing as a barometer to measure progressive credentials, is opposed by the real estate industry and backed by Jumaane Williams, the New York City public advocate, who is running against Ms. Hochul in the gubernatorial primary. Ms. Hochul said in November that she was “not going to be telegraphing my positions early on because otherwise it’s not a collaborative process.” She offered a similar noncommittal response when asked last month about the New York Health Act, which would create universal single-payer health coverage in the state, drastically altering the health care industry. The bill faces serious hurdles, including opposition from public sector unions that Ms. Hochul is trying to court, but it has enough Democratic co-sponsors to pass both houses. Ms. Hochul, a former congresswoman who represented a conservative-leaning district, was expected to come under significant pressure to back left-wing initiatives to remain competitive in the Democratic primary, which tends to attract the party’s most liberal voters. But that pressure eased after her most serious challenger, Letitia James, the state attorney general, withdrew from the race. Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat from Manhattan, said Ms. James’s decision “was an absolute gift to Kathy Hochul.” “I don’t think Kathy will think she has to move so far to her left that it puts her at any specific risks in the general election, where she has to move toward the center,” said Ms. Krueger, who endorsed Ms. Hochul. Yet Ms. Hochul has also sought common ground with the party’s left flank on some issues. She joined Senator Jabari Brisport, a democratic socialist from Brooklyn, on a statewide listening tour he held last month to build support for legislation to implement universal child care in New York. Ms. Hochul’s stance on Mr. Brisport’s proposal, which he said would provide free child care for children under 3 at a cost of about $5 billion a year, remains unclear, but she has said that child care would be “a major priority.” “I think it says a lot that she’s willing to build really good bridges between the executive branch and the legislative branch and work in concert together,” Mr. Brisport said. On some policy matters, Ms. Hochul has been unequivocal. She has ruled out raising taxes on the wealthy, saying she did not want to drive away high-income individuals, whose personal income tax contributions fund a significant portion of the state’s budget. New York City’s top earners now pay the highest combined local tax rate in the nation after the Legislature overcame longtime opposition from Mr. Cuomo in April to raise taxes on the rich. Her opposition to higher taxes comes as state coffers are flush with cash after a windfall of federal funding and higher than projected tax revenues that helped close a once-daunting $15 billion budget gap precipitated by the pandemic. Now, state officials are anticipating balanced budgets through fiscal year 2025, placing additional pressure on Ms. Hochul from special interest groups with suggestions of how to spend the extra money. So far, Ms. Hochul has quelled questions about her stances on certain issues partially by deepening a reservoir of good will that she has with lawmakers. They applaud her more collaborative style of governing compared with Mr. Cuomo. Even so, as much as Ms. Hochul has sought to distance herself from Mr. Cuomo, she has not shied away from embracing modified versions of plans he championed, especially infrastructure projects, including the renovation of Pennsylvania Station and an overhaul of Kennedy International Airport. State officials said Ms. Hochul would focus her speech on strengthening the health care work force, economic recovery, public safety and affordable housing.  She has already hinted at other priorities she will pursue, such as investments in green energy projects and a $4 billion environmental bond act. Her decision to deliver her speech in the Assembly chamber in the State Capitol will mark the return of a longtime tradition in Albany; Mr. Cuomo had moved his annual addresses to a larger convention center, a move that was seen by some lawmakers as a slight."

The jury of eight men and four women has spent around 50 hours over seven days so far deliberating whether Ms. Holmes, 37, is guilty of two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud. Each fraud count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The deliberations follow a more than three-month-long trial for Ms. Holmes that laid bare the worst excesses of Silicon Valley’s start-up culture, where founders regularly stretch the truth in search of fortune and fame. Yet entrepreneurs rarely take their exaggerations as far as Ms. Holmes did, and are often not prosecuted. Ms. Holmes styled herself after Steve Jobs and said she planned to revolutionize health care with her start-up. On Monday morning, jurors sent a note saying they were deadlocked on three of the counts. They did not elaborate on which of the counts were at issue. Judge Edward J. Davila of the Northern District of California, who is overseeing the case, instructed them to continue deliberating. In the afternoon, the jury returned with a second note saying they could not reach a verdict on the three charges after trying again. After the judge polled the jurors to confirm they were deadlocked, they were instructed to fill out a verdict form on the counts they agreed on. The jurors had asked no questions of the court since Dec. 23, when they asked to listen to audio recordings in which Ms. Holmes allegedly misled investors about Theranos’s business relationships. They also asked to take jury instructions home, which the court denied. If the jury is unable to reach a verdict on all of the counts, Judge Davila could accept a verdict on the counts they do agree on, said Andrew George, a white-collar defense lawyer at the firm Baker Botts. That would mean Ms. Holmes could be retried on the three counts. But a retrial is less likely if she is found guilty on the other counts, Mr. George said. “The government will have won,” he said. He added that a partial verdict was not ideal in a long trial because “it’s dissatisfying for all involved” but that “the nightmare of a total mistrial is very unlikely.” Ms. Holmes’s trial has stood out for its length and its meandering pace. Judge Davila has allowed her lawyers to grill certain witnesses for days and indulged long procedural debates that delayed many days of testimony. Since Ms. Holmes’s trial began in September, a number of prominent criminal trials — including those of Travis McMichael, Gregory McMichael and William Bryan Jr., who killed Ahmaud Arbery; Kyle Rittenhouse, who shot three men in Kenosha, Wis., in 2020; and Kim Potter, the police officer who killed Daunte Wright — have come and gone. Last week, a jury found Ghislaine Maxwell guilty of conspiring with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom and sexually abuse underage girls. It is not unusual for deliberations in white-collar trials to be lengthy, especially in complex fraud cases in which defendants are charged with multiple counts that span multiple years. In 2007, a jury took 12 days to convict Conrad Black, a press tycoon, of fraud after a 14-week trial that involved 13 counts. Martin Shkreli, the infamous former hedge fund manager, was convicted of securities fraud after five days of deliberations in 2017 following a five-week trial. In Ms. Holmes’s case, the jury must sift through 14 weeks of testimony and more than 900 pieces of evidence as they decide whether Ms. Holmes intentionally deceived investors, patients and advertisers in the pursuit of investments and business for her blood testing start-up. Ms. Holmes founded Theranos in 2003. She dropped out of Stanford in 2004 and spent the next decade raising nearly $1 billion from investors and signing contracts with Walgreens and Safeway. But The Wall Street Journal revealed in 2015 that Theranos’s blood-testing devices could perform only a dozen tests, contrary to Ms. Holmes’s claims of more than 1,000 to investors, business partners and the public. Theranos officially shuttered in 2018 amid scandal. Prosecutors called 29 witnesses as they attempted to prove that Ms. Holmes “chose fraud over business failure,” as Jeff Schenk, an assistant U.S. attorney, said during closing arguments. The defense’s case rested primarily on Ms. Holmes’s own testimony. She said she believed her own claims and pointed fingers at her senior employees, including Ramesh Balwani, her ex-boyfriend and Theranos’s former chief operating officer. Mr. Balwani, who faces identical charges, is scheduled to stand trial beginning in February."

A vast majority of U.S. public schools appeared to be operating as planned this week, including those in New York City, the country’s largest district. But the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant, along with labor and testing shortages, has led to a growing number of educational disruptions. Districts in Detroit, Milwaukee, Cleveland and Newark were among those announcing that their schools would switch to remote learning for periods lasting from a few days to several weeks. Many schools do not have enough coronavirus tests, and principals have reported large numbers of teachers and other employees calling in sick, either because they are infected with the virus or other illnesses, are caring for sick family members, or are fearful of the conditions within school buildings. The building closures appeared to be concentrated — at least for now — in regions, such as the Northeast and upper Midwest, where Democratic policymakers and powerful teachers’ unions have taken a more cautious approach to operating schools throughout the pandemic. Unions, politicians and educators now all say they want schools to remain open. But there are fears that Omicron may push many more districts to close, at least temporarily. Large city school systems in Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee and Newark have joined a growing list of public schools across the country that have postponed reopening after the holiday break, switched to remote instruction, or have taken both steps because of Covid-19 outbreaks and staffing shortages. Some of the announcements came abruptly, as school leaders struggled to respond to a rapidly changing situation. Some school systems that are open for in-person instruction this week have nonetheless had to shut some school buildings for lack of staff, including eight schools in Columbus, Ohio, and 12 in Pittsburgh. CHICAGO — With coronavirus cases in Chicago soaring to their highest levels of the pandemic, public school students returned to classrooms on Monday. Whether they will still be there at midweek remains an open question. Members of the Chicago Teachers Union were preparing to vote on whether to work remotely starting on Wednesday, with or without the district’s blessing. The union, which has repeatedly clashed with Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration, had demanded that every student be tested for the virus before returning from winter break, a step the district did not take. At a news conference on Monday, the union’s vice president, Stacy Davis Gates, expressed her anger at having “to continuously fight for the basic necessities, the basic mitigations.” Instead of universal testing, the district gave tens of thousands of students optional take-home tests before winter break. On Monday, it became clear that the testing effort to ensure a safe reopening had largely failed. Of 35,590 tests recorded by the district in the week ending Saturday, 24,843 had invalid results. Among the minority of tests that did produce results, 18 percent were positive. A district official said test vendors were looking into the reasons for the inconclusive results. Even as cases and hospitalizations around Chicago have risen, school leaders have been steadfast in their belief that classrooms should stay open. Pedro Martinez, the district’s chief executive, said in an interview last week that he could not support closing all schools at a time when the rest of the city remained open for business. Instead, Mr. Martinez said it made more sense to make decisions about reverting to online teaching on a classroom-by-classroom basis as outbreaks emerged. Chicago Public Schools officials said on Monday that they were concerned about the union’s planned vote on switching to online instruction. If union members decided to pause in-person teaching, it was not clear whether the district would authorize that remote instruction or lock educators out. The dispute has left parents — both those who want their students in the classroom, and those who would have preferred to start the semester online — with little clarity on how the school year will unfold. “All of that uncertainty and chaos just really makes everything harder,” said Cassie Creswell, who leads a state-level education advocacy group in Illinois and who has a daughter at a public high school in Chicago. Ms. Creswell said she would have preferred that the district start the semester online. Ismael El-Amin, who has children at two Chicago schools, including one where he serves on the Local School Council, said his family was “definitely in a reactive mode” as he waited to see what disruptions might emerge. Mr. El-Amin said his family had skipped large Christmas and New Year’s celebrations with family in order to limit potential exposure to the virus. Mr. El-Amin said he had become more worried about how the constant upheaval might affect his daughters, who are vaccinated. “That fear is kind of transformed from the medical worst-case scenario to, this is going to be another month, another semester where my daughter’s going to miss out on consistent education, getting to know her friends, getting to know her teachers,” Mr. El-Amin said. ATLANTA — Days after announcing that classes for K-12 students would be held in person after the holiday break, officials with Atlanta Public Schools reversed their decision, saying on Saturday that classes would be online only during the first week of the year. The decision came “after further review of district and community Covid-19 data,” a statement from the district said. Nearby Clayton, DeKalb, Fulton and Rockdale Counties have also pushed back the return to in-person classes because of high infection rates in those areas. On Friday, the Georgia Department of Health reported more than 24,000 cases of Covid-19 in the state. As of Sunday, the state had a seven-day average of 14,343 cases per day, according to a New York Times database. That is a spike of more than 700 percent over two weeks. The Atlanta school district recorded its second highest weekly count of positive cases for the school year during the final week of the fall semester, with 306 students and 129 employees testing positive. The highest positivity rate was in August when 520 people were sick. Students who needed laptops and other devices for virtual classes were encouraged to pick them up at their schools on Monday. Those who needed meal kits could pick them up at one of eight schools across the city. Atlanta Public Schools staff members were required to go to work on Monday for mandatory Covid testing unless they were sick. “The data collected from staff testing will be used for future planning,” the district’s statement on Saturday said. Students are expected to return to in-person classes on Jan. 10. WASHINGTON — The federal government released new recommendations last month for unvaccinated students exposed to the coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said those students could remain in school, as long as they are tested for the virus twice in the week after exposure and both tests come back negative. The latest guidance, known as the “test-to-stay” protocol, aims to minimize disruptions to learning as two highly contagious variants of the virus, Delta and Omicron, spread across the country, causing some school closures and threatening to upend the strategies that federal and state officials adopted to return to in-person classes in the fall. Although some schools and districts are already using the test-to-stay approach, the C.D.C. had not previously endorsed it, citing a lack of evidence. Last month, the agency released studies from two counties, one in California and the other in Illinois, that effectively tested the protocol and found that it worked. The studies were conducted before the fast-moving Omicron variant began spreading in the United States. Scientists are still investigating many basic questions about the variant, including whether it increases the risk of in-school transmission. The new policy, hinted at in the winter Covid-19 plan that President Biden unveiled last month, still calls on students to wear masks and socially distance, and applies only to those who remain asymptomatic. Until now, unvaccinated students were expected to quarantine at home for as long as two weeks after exposure. Some states have had tens of thousands of students in quarantine. Vaccinated students with exposures have generally been allowed to remain in school as long as they are asymptomatic and wear a mask. Mayor Eric Adams insisted on Monday morning that New York City’s schools would stay open despite an extraordinary surge in Omicron cases. But about a third of city parents did not send their children back to classrooms on the first day after the holiday break. Attendance was just over 67 percent, slightly higher than the low point of 65 percent the system reached on the day before winter break. Throughout the day on Monday, Adams was adamant that the system would remain open. He repeated the message in a series of television interviews and after his first official school visit since taking office on New Year’s Day. “We’re really excited about the opening of our schools,” Mr. Adams said outside the school, Concourse Village Elementary School in the Bronx. “We want to be extremely clear: the safest place for our children is a school building.” Mr. Adams said that remote learning had been disastrous for too many of the city’s nearly one million schoolchildren in the nation’s largest school district, and had been particularly harmful for children in low-income neighborhoods and homeless students. But the calm that Mr. Adams sought to project was not shared by the many parents and educators who greeted Monday morning with profound trepidation. After roughly a year of remarkably low virus transmission in schools, Covid cases soared in the week before the winter break, prompting the closures of 11 schools and over 400 classrooms, and the contact tracing system for city schools effectively collapsed amid the surge. New York City reported 35,650 new virus cases on Sunday, with a 7-day average test positivity rate of nearly 22 percent, according to state data. Some families and elected officials have called on Mr. Adams to delay the start of school by a few days to allow every child and educator to get tested. And teachers have raised questions about how schools will be properly staffed with so many teachers sick with the virus or quarantining due to exposures. “This is an all hands on deck moment,” Mr. Adams said, acknowledging that administrators who are not normally in the classroom would be used to address staff shortages if necessary. Mr. Adams has endorsed a plan created by former Mayor Bill de Blasio that is designed to keep more classrooms open as the surge continues. The plan calls for distributing 1.5 million rapid at-home test kits to schools. Starting Monday, the city is also doubling its random in-school testing program to give P.C.R. tests to 20 percent of consenting children in each school weekly. But most families have not opted in to allow their children to be tested, which has made the testing pool very small at some schools. The mayor and the new schools chancellor, David C. Banks, are betting that their plan to increase testing will prevent major outbreaks. “We’re going to turn those question marks into an exclamation point: we’re staying open,” Mr. Adams said. Mr. Adams and Mr. Banks have so far resisted calls to mandate booster shots for educators or vaccines for children. The mayor has said a decision will be made this spring about mandating vaccines for students for the fall. “We’re not at the point of mandate,” Mr. Adams said Monday, as he encouraged eligible New Yorkers to get vaccinated and boosted. Michael Mulgrew, president of the city’s teachers’ union, said in an email to members that he had encouraged Mr. Adams to start the year remotely. But on Monday morning, Mr. Mulgrew said he was working closely with the new mayor and that schools had been some of the safest places in the city throughout the pandemic. Later on Monday, Gov. Kathy Hochul reiterated her commitment to keeping New York’s children in schools. “My view is that every child should be back in school unless they are testing positive,” she said. The state has distributed 5.2 million at-home test kits to schools thus far, and another 3.8 million arrived yesterday and have yet to be distributed. Under the current rule, test kits will only be provided to students for known exposures that occur in classrooms, although Ms. Hochul said that policy was under review. She also cautioned against a return to remote learning. “The teachers did the best they could. The parents did the best they could,” she said. “But we ask too much.” In particular, she spoke about the effects of remote learning on children in communities of color, those who lacked resources and those without high-speed internet access — an existing digital divide that she said had widened into a “digital canyon.” “We cannot have that,” Ms. Hochul said. “That was an injustice. We cannot have that anymore.” As New York City schools opened up after winter break, parents who crowded sidewalks in Brooklyn to pick up their children expressed a mix of anxiety, relief and resignation about students returning to classrooms amid a rise in coronavirus cases. Mirta Desir, of Bedford-Stuyvesant, biked to P.S. 250 George H. Lindsay in Williamsburg to pick up her third-grade daughter from the first day back. Ms. Desir, a filmmaker, said she hoped her daughter’s school was taking the necessary precautions to protect all the children from the coronavirus. She said her daughter was fully vaccinated, but added that can only do so much in keeping everyone safe. “I think the new mayor said something along the lines of school is now safer,” she said. “I don’t think it’s safer. But I think them going to school is as safe as her staying at home with me because I have to go to work and I have to be outside and she’s in contact with me.” Ms. Desir said being a working parent and helping her daughter during the remote learning phase of the pandemic was a “tight balancing act” that she’ll ultimately support if schools shut down again. “At the end of the day, it’s about the health and safety of the kids,” she said. “I would love if all the adults got vaccinated to mitigate anything for them. But if that’s not the case, then parents have to make the right decisions that they feel is best for their family.” Jamie Arriaga, of Williamsburg, said it was “nerve-racking” to send her first-grade son back to school at P.S. 250. Ms. Arriaga said she did not want him to go back with coronavirus cases rising, but that as a single parent she also couldn’t afford to take time off to help him with remote learning. “It’s just like you’re just damned if you do and you’re damned if you don’t,” she said. “I don’t want him in school if it’s going to be crazy. So it’s just a headache every day.” Ms. Arriaga said the decision to ramp up testing in schools didn’t ease any of her concerns. She’s vaccinated against the coronavirus, but has no plans to vaccinate her son. “Everything is so confusing,” she said. “You don’t know if schools are doing the best that they can. I’m confused every day and I have to just figure it out.” Ruben Lopez, of Williamsburg, was also at P.S. 250 to pick up his daughter. He said he didn’t want to send her back to school, but had no other choice as he doesn’t fully support remote learning. “At home is good, but it’s not the same. I don’t think it is as effective,” he said, comparing remote learning with in-person classes. “So sending them back was scary, but it was good at the same time.” Mr. Lopez said knowing how exuberant children can be, he was afraid of his daughter being exposed. “Kids are going to be kids,” he said. “You can’t control the virus amongst kids.” Jenny Vogel, of Bushwick, waited outside of Brooklyn Arbor Elementary School in Williamsburg to pick up her two children. Ms. Vogel, an art professor, said she didn’t have any anxieties around sending her children back to school because they are vaccinated. She felt it was important for schools to stay open so parents can work, but she will ultimately support whatever measures will keep all children safe. “Remote learning was tough on me, working from home and doing that and doing my own work,” she said. “But I understand if cases go up too much then it needs to happen, and we’ll roll with the recommendations of the city.” In the Mid-Atlantic region, school reopening plans that were not disrupted by the Omicron variant were thrown aside by a massive winter storm. Schools in Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania that were scheduled to open on Monday stayed shut because of the weather.  Concerns about the virus and Covid-related staffing shortages forced officials to announce remote learning at dozens of schools in Pittsburgh and Columbus, while the chief executive of Cleveland schools announced last week that the whole district would be remote for the first week back. But everywhere, it seemed, things were changing not only by the day but by the hour. The Philadelphia school district said in a Jan. 1 message posted on its website that with “extensive mitigation measures and safety protocols,” schools would be welcoming students back in person on Jan. 4. Among those measures, the district announced that in a change to protocol, students or staff members who did not comply with school mask requirements would be sent home. The local teachers union, however, reported that nearly 1,100 of its 13,000 members had tested positive over the winter break. The president of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers, Jerry T. Jordan, urged the superintendent to institute “a seven day pause on the return to in-person learning,” during which the district could strengthen its mitigation protocols. But as of Monday afternoon, the city seemed committed to the school district’s original plan, with the health commissioner saying in a statement that “in-person learning is critical to the well-being of our children.” Outside of Philadelphia, in the Central Bucks School district, where a debate over school Covid-19 policies consumed school board meetings and dominated the school board elections in November, the first day back was postponed by “staffing shortages associated with the Omicron-related spike in Covid-19 cases.” In a letter sent out on Sunday, the superintendent announced that staff members would be absent “across every school and operating division within our district,” and that there were not enough substitutes available to fill in. “My first reaction is that I’m not surprised,” said Karen Smith, a Central Bucks board member who noted in vexation that a majority of the board voted last month to end a school mask requirement. “It’s all immensely frustrating. Just tiring and overwhelming.” Across the South, most public schools started the new year on time and in person on Monday, though some instituted new requirements to try to curb the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant. New Orleans students returned to school on Monday as planned, with a requirement that students and staff wear masks on school grounds, indoors and outdoors. And as of Feb. 1, all students ages 5 and older will be required to be vaccinated, though families can opt out under certain circumstances. “This is one more measure to make sure that we can continue to preserve in-person learning,” said Henderson Lewis Jr., the superintendent for the district, at a news conference on Monday.  Some smaller districts in Louisiana, including Concordia Parish Public Schools and Natchitoches Parish Schools, also reinstated mask mandates for the start of the semester. In South Carolina, Greenville County Schools, which serve more than 75,000 students, resumed in-person on Monday. On Friday, the district adjusted its requirements for isolating and quarantining students and staff. Notably, the isolation period for students who test positive for Covid-19 but are asymptomatic, was reduced from 10 to five days. Students are required to wear a mask for days 6 through 10 when they return to school. In Alabama, several school districts announced mask mandates for the start of the new semester. They included Madison County, which includes the city of Huntsville, as well as Talladega City and Pike County.  Macon County and the city of Sylacauga, which each serve some 2,000 students, said over the weekend that the first week of school would be virtual. “Considering the surge right here in our community following the holiday gatherings, this is the reasonable course of action to protect our students and teachers from exposure,” said Michele Eller, the superintendent for the Sylacauga district, on Sunday. Ms. Eller acknowledged the challenge that canceling in-person classes could present to families but said with classes beginning on Wednesday, families have a few days to pick up tools necessary for virtual lessons.  In the metro Jackson and Pine Belt areas of Mississippi, classes were expected to return, in person, on Tuesday. Existing Covid-19 precautions, including mandatory masking, will remain in place. DALLAS — Most districts in Texas plan to return to classes as usual this week, so far avoiding the disruptions in schools across the United States because of Omicron. Some districts are adjusting their Covid policies in response to the surge. The state forbids school districts from requiring that students and teachers wear masks or be vaccinated, but many school districts have defied the ban on mask mandates. Cases in the country’s second-most populous state have more than doubled in the last two weeks, and hospitalizations have also risen sharply. But its case rate of 43 per 100,000 residents remains far below the national average for now, and serious illness among children remains rare.  In most districts, children will return to in-person instruction this week, after a holiday break in which cases numbers of the milder Omicron variant skyrocketed. Here is what different districts are doing: The recent spike in Covid cases in Michigan forced several school districts to move classes online, or cancel them altogether, this week. In Detroit, the state’s largest school district, families were told on Dec. 31 that classes would be canceled, with no remote option, from Monday to Wednesday, to ensure all of its nearly 8,000 employees get tested before classes start again. Citing record infection rates in the city, the superintendent, Nikolai P. Vitti, said that voluntary testing last week of employees revealed an infection rate of 20 percent.  Detroit, and the rest of Wayne County, reported more cases in December than ever before, according to The New York Times’s coronavirus tracker. The county has reported a daily average of 2,675 cases, an increase of 108 percent over the past two weeks. The district hasn’t announced plans for Thursday and Friday, but it has opened free coronavirus testing sites at 10 of its schools in the meantime. After Detroit shut down its schools at the beginning of the pandemic, it extended the closures until January 2021. Many other schools had already reopened. And last month, the entire district went remote every Friday. Lorenzo Spencer, whose son is a freshman at Cass Technical High School, in Detroit, said he isn’t surprised by the announcement. His son’s school already follows a hybrid model, where students show up a few days out of the week. “There’s no playbook for what we’re going through,” Mr. Spencer said. “As long as they’re doing what they can do to stay safe, I’m all for it.” In Ann Arbor, the schools superintendent announced that classrooms are closed until Jan. 10. The switch to virtual learning, Jeanice K. Swift, the superintendent, said, will let the district monitor cases in the area and account for how many of its employees called in sick. Some parents in Ann Arbor aren’t entirely on board. “I don’t think shutting school is the answer to Covid,” Stephanie McCartney, whose son attends kindergarten at Haisley Elementary School, said. “I think it would be better if they were in school.” Elsewhere in Michigan, schools in Pontiac are remote until Jan. 18, while schools in Southfield are remote until Jan. 10. SACRAMENTO — With the Omicron variant raging across California, millions of schoolchildren returned to classrooms on Monday, ending the holiday break as many had spent it — masked, distanced, apprehensive and in long lines with their parents, scrambling for coronavirus tests. Few schools were closed in a state whose Covid-19 precautions have been among the most aggressive in the nation. California has managed to maintain comparatively low rates of virus-related deaths and hospitalizations. But infections have soared recently because of the highly contagious variant, which appears to result in less severe cases. In hundreds of districts, in-person instruction was conditioned on heightened health requirements and fraught with the understanding that even those might not prevent a return to remote learning. “Frankly, the disruption I’m worried about isn’t Day 1 — it’s Day 2, 3 or 4 if we get 30 or 40 or 50 positive cases,” said Alex Cherniss, the superintendent of the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, where, after days of impassioned community debate, some 10,000 students in coastal Los Angeles County returned to class on Monday. “People are exhausted here,” he said. California’s largest school district, Los Angeles Unified, was not scheduled to resume classes until next week. But on Monday, the district issued new rules requiring baseline testing as a condition of returning to campus, regardless of vaccination status. Previously, testing had been optional for vaccinated and asymptomatic students and employees. In many other districts, reopening classrooms on Monday also hinged on fresh rounds of coronavirus testing. In Marin County, students had been given kits to test for the virus before re-entering campus. In Sacramento County, families stood for hours over the weekend at testing sites hastily erected by school districts or took advantage of an infusion of six million take-home tests the state supplied to districts across California as Omicron was starting to spike. “We did two tests at home and he’s fine,” Emily Ramey said as she dropped off her younger child at a middle school in suburban Sacramento. “I’m just hoping that everyone else tested, too.” Los Angeles Unified already conducts the nation’s largest weekly school-based coronavirus testing program, but health officials in the county have ratcheted up other measures that will affect the hundreds of thousands of students and employees in the school system, along with those in private schools and nearly 80 other public school districts. New health rules starting Jan. 1 mandate, for example, that returning students at all of the county’s districts wear face masks not only indoors but also outside at recess, and that school employees upgrade to medical-grade N95 or KN95 face coverings. Gov. Gavin Newsom has reiterated that the state is “committed” to keeping classrooms open and promised last month to make home testing kits “available to every K-12 public school student as they head back to the classroom from winter break.” But not all districts had received their allotment by Monday. San Francisco schools increased mobile testing sites throughout the city and strongly encouraged students to get tested before returning, in part because they will not receive their allotment of tests from the state until later this week. In Palos Verdes, Mr. Cherniss said concern over Omicron almost prompted the district to delay reopening until next week. But when he announced he was considering it, he said, the outcry from parents was fierce. Eventually, the district opted to reopen as scheduled, but to strongly encourage students to test before returning. “We did a big push over the weekend,” he said. “We handed out 2,000 home tests in less than three hours and did another 2,000 live tests. More than 100 were positive.” MIAMI — Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida reiterated on Monday that officials would not allow the state’s public schools to close, despite a major spike in coronavirus cases fueled by the Omicron variant. “You have worse outcomes by closing schools,” said Mr. DeSantis, a Republican who has increased his national profile by rejecting coronavirus lockdowns and mandates for much of the pandemic. “Kids need to be in school.” Furthermore, the governor said while speaking in Fort Lauderdale, children “do not need to be doing any crazy mitigation” such as testing or wearing masks, unless their parents want them to. He added: “Just let them be kids.” In November, Florida legislators heeded the governor’s request to ban mask requirements in public schools. Ahead of Monday, when most classes resumed after the holiday break, some large school districts, including in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, mandated masks for teachers and other adult employees — but not for students. In a news conference on Monday promoting monoclonal antibody treatments, Mr. DeSantis said public universities would remain open, too. He criticized private institutions that have returned to virtual learning temporarily or required students to shelter in place on campus. “I think any university that does that should have to refund 100 percent of the tuition to the parents,” he said. The governor rejected the idea that children should be regularly tested, or that adults should be tested if they do not have Covid-19 symptoms. He said too much testing of people whose clinical outcomes would not change as a result of a positive test was limiting supply. The state’s surgeon general, Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo, said he is drafting guidelines on who should get tested so that fewer people feel the need to do so. “We’re going to be working to unwind the sort of testing psychology that our federal leadership has managed to unfortunately get most of the country in over the last two years,” Dr. Ladapo said. That approach is at odds with public health experts who have encouraged the opposite, urging more people to get tested regularly so they can go about their daily lives. Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, said widely available testing is key to deploying early therapeutic treatments, including the monoclonal antibodies that Mr. DeSantis has promoted. And knowing if a younger, healthy person is infected can help protect an older, more vulnerable person. “The idea that we don’t care about infections in low-risk people only works if low-risk people never interact with high-risk people,” Dr. Jha said. In Warwick, R.I., parents of students at Veterans Middle School received a message on Sunday night informing them that classes on Monday would be held remotely because so many teachers had called in sick, many of them with Covid-19. The high school in Johnston, R.I., opened as expected on Monday morning — only to shut down a few hours later because so many staffers were absent. Across New England, school districts were improvising the start of the new year, as staff shortages and testing protocols amid the Omicron variant surge challenged their ability to open normally. Providence, R.I., school officials staggered the return to in-person classes this week, with some students scheduled to be in class on Monday but others not until Tuesday or Wednesday. The idea was to allow time for Covid testing before students returned. In Arlington, Mass., outside of Boston, officials intended to release students early on Monday and Tuesday and focus on pooled virus testing of staff and students. Still, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, who greeted students as they arrived at the Saltonstall School in Salem, Mass., on Monday morning, counted it as a success that most of his state’s schools were open for in-person education. “There was all kinds of talk last week about how school wouldn’t open in Massachusetts today,” he said at a press briefing. “School did. Pretty much across the Commonwealth.” The state had rejected calls from the Massachusetts Teachers Association to keep schools closed on Monday in order to focus on staff Covid testing. In Boston, where students were expected back in school on Tuesday morning, the mayor said the city would do all it could to keep schools open for in-person learning but acknowledged that staffing shortages might ultimately create difficulties. Officials said that 155 school district employees had tested positive for Covid over the weekend. WASHINGTON — Local officials in the nation’s capital on Monday pushed back the reopening of public schools by a day because of a snowstorm. Covid-19 tests will now be available for pick-up on Tuesday and Wednesday, they said, and schools in the district will instead reopen in person on Thursday. City and school officials announced at the end of December that all students and staff would be required to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test result before returning to school. While schools will start in person, it’s possible that classrooms will have to switch to virtual learning in the coming weeks.  “The health and safety of our community remain paramount as we prepare to welcome students and staff back to our schools,” said Chancellor Lewis D. Ferebee in a statement. Covid cases in the district have increased 485 percent in the past two weeks, according to The New York Times’s tracker, with an average rate of 2,103 cases per day. Hospitalizations have increased 60 percent during the same time period. Talisa Sutton-Stephenson, 36, has four children in public and charter schools in the city, who will be returning to in-person learning on Wednesday and Thursday. Ms. Sutton-Stephenson, who is an educator for the District of Columbia Public Schools, said she was thrilled that her children, who are all fully vaccinated, would be returning to school in person. She was especially happy for her 6-year-old daughter. “She’s really a different child in person than she is virtually,” said Ms. Sutton-Stephenson, who is also fully vaccinated. “She retains more information. She really does value relationships with her teachers and other students.” “I cannot see doing virtual again,” said Ms. Sutton-Stephenson. “I really wish that the conversation or the narrative would switch from staying home to, ‘What do you need to do to stay in person safely?’” Teachers agree that in-person learning is the best choice right now, said Jacqueline Pogue Lyons, the president of the Washington Teachers Union. “Our teachers are very anxious because we know that the numbers are very high, but we know that the best place for students to be is in person,” said Ms. Pogue Lyons, adding that it was “going to be a long probably month and a half.” She said she was pleased that the District was one of the few places in the country that would require a negative test from all teachers, students, and staff before returning to school. The school system also plans to offer all teachers K95 masks, and the union is pushing for students to receive those masks too. A number of other schools in the D.C. metro area have either canceled classes entirely on Monday or switched to virtual learning because of either the snowstorm, Covid-19, or both. Those include Arlington Public Schools, Fairfax County Schools, Montgomery County Public Schools, and Prince George’s County Public Schools. At least one school district in Ohio went remote this week because of the rise of cases in the state, and it’s unclear when students will go back. Other districts extended winter break by canceling classes altogether on Monday. In Cleveland, the city’s superintendent, Eric Gordon, announced on Wednesday that classes would be remote this week. But parents can still stop by to pick up their child’s lunch, and the district won’t cancel any sports practices or games scheduled this week. The district will continue to monitor the virus’s spread, he said, before deciding if students can return on Jan. 10. More than 2,500 people on average are testing positive daily in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, a 17 percent increase over the last two weeks, according to The New York Times’s coronavirus tracker. Shari Obrenski, the president of the local teachers union, said that while in-person instruction is preferred, schools are struggling to find enough substitutes as more teachers continue to call in sick. “You want to be able to provide an education for your students,” she said. “And when you don’t have enough adults to do that, across the multitude of jobs that need to be performed in a school, you’re better off remote.” Some parents, like Danielle Shipman, said they aren’t concerned about having their children home alone, but are worried about the quality of instruction with remote learning. Her two eldest children, a freshman and a junior at John Marshall High School, in Cleveland, were held back after failing last year. “My kids can’t learn this way,” she said. “I’m frustrated. I don’t know what else to do.” Ms. Shipman, who works full time at a nursing home, isn’t able to stay home to make sure they are actually paying attention when they sign onto virtual school. “This isn’t working,” she said. “And this generation is just screwed at this point. I mean, we can only do so much as parents.” Waverly City Schools and Springfield Local Schools also extended winter break by canceling class on Monday. And some students at the Reynoldsburg City Schools district transitioned to virtual learning."
196,The New York Times,nytimes,Some officials have vowed to keep schools open as Covid cases spike across the U.S. But parents and educators are growing fearful that more districts will soon turn to remote learning  — even though in-school transmission of Covid has been limited.,https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3FSWQXJ%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1JZkiyM7t4_eSVcHaIeyHKBcv-J3tm1MfeNcGmh33LK8-EOImLOOw4-n8&h=AT1ecipOxQfAxM_0mVFn4LF8dEq9FliSh0bp6Es9c5db7R_2a4TredZWfWtVyJGU7NSzRGr7wnbD3HCchtpILTnwS0u5isehkcx_w4D8O2dMFVSjRwllDQCcNjpqf6VRxqtjfnEvbGfNfuijj9q0&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT15H4pRQIV2UrOnsGQ8gLxgfXB3YcKZfyMRHBPIEudBWwKL3rXreQ6nJnjYtOa1nGVMC_NhHgxsuflN-g8iUqjU29_91_3PLUuWfpToE_3mbHZ2rlJMWWgmGqRIZQLIcLhp9cbZquOG3Y2oaefLvVLoUtjvHPN1VMAz8OmswUdJnL9U,3d,"Facebook on Monday suspended for 24 hours the account of Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene for spreading misinformation about the coronavirus, a day after Twitter permanently banned one of her accounts for posting a similar message. Ms. Greene, a Georgia Republican, had posted falsely about “extremely high amounts of Covid vaccine deaths.” She published the message on Saturday as part a long post on American life “Before Covid” and “After Covid,” calling public health measures meant to stem the spread of the coronavirus into question, including testing, mask-wearing and vaccine mandates. On Monday morning, on the alternative social messaging platform Telegram, Ms. Greene posted a screenshot of a Facebook notice that said, “You can’t post or comment for 24 hours,” and cited a violation of Facebook’s community standards. “A post violated our policies and we have removed it, but removing her account for this violation is beyond the scope of our policies,” Aaron Simpson, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. The social network has increasingly changed its content policies over past two years as the coronavirus has surged, saying in December 2020 that it would remove posts with claims that had been debunked by the World Health Organization or government agencies. Facebook suspended Ms. Greene’s personal Facebook account, where she had published the message about vaccines. The company left her verified government account active. Twitter, which said it had banned Ms. Greene’s personal account after she had a fifth “strike,” also left her government account active. Ms. Greene’s post cited misleading information from a government database of unverified raw data called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, a decades-old system that relies on self-reported cases from patients and health care providers. There is no evidence of widespread major side effects from the coronavirus vaccines apart from a rare blood clotting disorder linked to Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, according to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month. There have been at least nine deaths in the United States related to the disorder in the past year, leading the agency to recommend using other approved vaccines instead. The VAERS database, which is managed by the Food and Drug Administration and the C.D.C., has been cited in many coronavirus falsehoods to push the idea that side effects from the coronavirus vaccines have been underreported. An overview of the VAERS database on the F.D.A.’s website said that VAERS reports “generally cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness.”"

It’s been a meteoric rise for the once-a-day game, which invites players to guess a five-letter word in a similar manner as the guess-the-color game Mastermind. After guessing a five-letter word, the game tells you whether any of your letters are in the secret word and whether they are in the correct place. You have six tries to get it right. Few such popular corners of the internet are as low-frills as the website, which Mr. Wardle built himself as a side project. There are no ads or flashing banners; no windows pop up or ask for money. There is merely the game on a black background. “I think people kind of appreciate that there’s this thing online that’s just fun,” Mr. Wardle said in an interview on Monday. “It’s not trying to do anything shady with your data or your eyeballs. It’s just a game that’s fun.” This is not Mr. Wardle’s first brush with suddenly capturing widespread attention. Formerly a software engineer for Reddit, he created two collaborative social experiments on the site, called The Button and Place, that each were phenomena in their moment. But Wordle was built without a team of engineers. It was just him and his partner, Palak Shah, killing time during a pandemic. Mr. Wardle said he first created a similar prototype in 2013, but his friends were unimpressed and he scrapped the idea. In 2020, he and Ms. Shah “got really into” the New York Times Spelling Bee and the daily crossword, “so I wanted to come up with a game that she would enjoy,” he said. The breakthrough, he said, was limiting players to one game per day. That enforced a sense of scarcity, which he said was partially inspired by the Spelling Bee, which leaves people wanting more, he said. Word games have proved immensely popular for The Times and other companies in recent years, and many such as the Spelling Bee have developed devoted fan followings. But since Wordle was built originally for just Mr. Wardle and Ms. Shah, the initial design ignored a lot of the growth-hacking features that are virtually expected of games in the current era. While other games send notifications to your phone hoping you’ll come back throughout the day, Wordle doesn’t want an intense relationship. “It’s something that encourages you to spend three minutes a day,” he said. “And that’s it. Like, it doesn’t want any more of your time than that.” Wordle lacked the ability to share results until mid-December. Mr. Wardle noticed players sharing their results by typing out a grid of green, yellow and black emojis, so he built an automated way for players to brag about their successes in a spoiler-free way. If he were optimizing the game to gain as many players as possible, he would have included a link at the end of the tweet that the tool generates, he said. But after looking into it, he said it would have looked “trashy” and not as visually compelling, and he liked the grid’s mysterious air, which he felt piqued people’s interest. While Ms. Shah was the lucky recipient of the first game, she has played a key role in getting it ready for the public, Mr. Wardle said. An initial list of all of the five-letter words in the English language — about 12,000 — contained a lot of obscure words that would have been near impossible to guess. So he created another game for Ms. Shah: This time, she would sort through those 12,000 or so words, designating whether or not she knew them. That narrowed down the list of Wordle words to about 2,500, which should last for a few years. (Already, a few words have riled up the fans: Some were upset by REBUS and TAPIR, saying they were not familiar enough.) Ms. Shah says she wakes up every day with a new routine: She warms up with the Spelling Bee, which gets her mind right for Wordle. She also loves the New York Times Crossword and cryptic crosswords. Though Wordle is now shared with the world, she said she appreciated that Mr. Wardle originally created it for her. “It’s really sweet,” she said. “This is definitely how Josh shows his love.”"

Then in November, Mayor Enrique Seoane noticed something that gave him a shock and caused a scandal in Spain. In a photo taken by one of his neighbors, Mr. Seoane spied a seam of very modern cement that someone had poured into a decidedly ancient archway. It was an apparent homemade repair job to keep the church’s eastern flank from falling in. The work was done by an unknown “masked restorer,” the mayor told a local journalist in a story that soon spread across Spain. While this might conjure visions of a superhero secretly coming to the aid of an aging church, that is not how the mayor’s words played in Spain. Instead, they stirred up bad memories in a country whose small towns and villages had been scarred before by the eyesores these sort of vigilante repair efforts leave behind. The figure of do-gooder gone bad was epitomized in Spain by Cecilia Giménez, a grandmother then in her 80s, who made headlines around the world after her botched restoration of a century-old fresco of Jesus crowned with thorns called “Ecce Homo.” The result was so bungled, authorities at first thought the painting had been vandalized. Spain’s art and architecture conservators vowed to stop these amateur, and unwanted, restorers. Yet in Castronuño, in Valladolid Province northwest of Madrid, a mysterious someone had struck again, this time at the Church of Santa María del Castillo, built around 1250 in the late-Romanesque style by the Knights Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem. Miguel Ángel García, the spokesman for the Valladolid Province Heritage Association, a small consortium of local residents who try to prevent this kind of travesty, among its other conservation efforts, had come for a look at the damage on a recent chilly evening. He gazed up at the cement, ruefully, as wind blew through a stork’s nest in the church’s bell tower. “The story of the ‘Ecce Homo’ just keeps repeating itself all over the country,” he said. It could be said that the problem of Castronuño is the problem of Spain: This ancient land just has too many old things in need of fixing. There are Phoenician forts, Celtic castles, Moorish minarets, Roman ramparts, granite Greek graves — all left by bygone civilizations that came here conquering, all bent on leaving something for posterity. Even the name of the Spanish heartland, Castille, means something like “land of castles,” since so many were built after 800 years of battles between Christian and Muslim rulers. As she stood outside Castronuño’s damaged church on a recent day, Mar Villarroel, a children’s book writer who doubles as the hamlet’s part-time tourism promoter, observed that if Spain’s blessing was that it had so much history, then its curse was that so much was at risk of being lost for neglect. Take the old castle, she said, for which the village had been named, but that had been razed by Ferdinand II of Aragón in the time of Columbus. Or Castronuño’s first church — built even earlier than the one in use today, but demolished in 1919 (decades after its roof had fallen in). More recently, the villagers had been begging the government and the local Roman Catholic Archdiocese to come fix Santa María del Castillo before it suffered a similar fate. But with no sign that any help was on the way, someone was moved to take matters into their own grossly misguided hands. “The cement is a scandal, it is ugly, yes,” Ms. Villarroel said. “But you want to know the real scandal? It’s that those in charge let the church get this way.” José Antonio Conde, a kind of church caretaker called a sacristan, was trying to find the key on a recent evening. Only four people had copies, he said, and at least three seemed to be out of town. Finally, a sister of one picked up the phone. He darted off to find her. Minutes later, he swung open the old creaky door. The church was nearly dark, and as eyes adjusted to the dim, the interior came slowly into view: a long nave, an old stone roof and a crucifix at the altar in front of a red drape. The large river stones that had been hauled up the hill during construction had each been signed with the mark of the ancient mason who had cut them. Mr. Conde found the light switch, and the rest of the church was suddenly visible. The damage couldn’t have been more clear. Years of water seeping into the walls from outside had left long white mineral stains, giving the appearance of a cave’s interior. The retablo, the grand shelves made of wood that sit behind the altar, had been professionally restored, but the moisture was threatening them again. It was too late for the 18th-century frescoes that once showed scenes from the life of Jesus: Only one was fully visible, of Christ carrying the cross. “You could still make them out when we were children,” said Manolo Brita, a friend of Mr. Conde’s, who had walked in behind him. Mr. Conde, pointing up to the choir near the old rosette window, recalled a different memory from childhood, now many decades gone. “I remember when that choir was filled with children,” he said. “It’s not now.” And that absence, he said, was the real reason the church was crumbling: because the village’s population was dwindling and there were few left to look after it anymore. The population had fallen from more than 1,500 when he was young to around 860 today, part of a rural flight that has afflicted villages across Spain. While the mayor’s report this fall of a “masked restorer” had set off angry calls for an investigation to find the culprit, information that surfaced later both complicated the whodunit and emphasized just how long these errant interventions had been plaguing the country. A local resident, looking through an aging book about the churches of the region, noticed an image that showed the same seam of cement over the archway at least as early as 1999, when the survey had been published. With the crime apparently at least two decades old, it seemed there might be no finding out who did it. Sitting in his office, Mr. Seoane, the mayor, said he regretted if his words had made people think there would be a manhunt for the culprit. But the fact that no one had noticed the cement had been there all those years was telling too, he said. And it wasn’t just the mishandled cement repair job that was now causing people to do a double take. Who had installed the alarm system that seemed drilled into the ancient stone? Or the bulky electrical conduit that jutted out of one of the ancient windows? It appeared to have been there for years, mostly unnoticed. And why was there wire mesh covering over the rosette window, and who had put it there? The list of impromptu repair jobs now being noticed at the church all of a sudden seemed endless. But at least the botched cement job — and the mayor’s colorful if fictional description of the perpetrator’s appearance — had gotten everyone’s attention, enough that Mr. Seoane thought he might finally get the funding to fix the other items that needed repair. “If we don’t get the job done this time,” he said, “I don’t think we ever will.”"

Mr. Orban has spent the past decade steadily building his “illiberal state,” as he proudly calls Hungary, with the help of lavish E.U. funding. Even as his project widened fissures in the bloc, which Hungary joined in 2004, his fellow national leaders mostly looked the other way, committed to staying out of one another’s affairs. But now Mr. Orban’s defiance and intransigence has had an important, if unintended, effect: serving as a catalyst for an often-sluggish European Union system to act to safeguard the democratic principles that are the foundation of the bloc. Early this year, the European Court of Justice will issue a landmark decision on whether the union has the authority to make its funds to member states conditional on meeting the bloc’s core values. Doing so would allow Brussels to deny billions of euros to countries that violate those values. The bloc has consistently worked on political consensus among national leaders. But Mr. Orban has pushed Brussels toward a threshold it had long avoided: making membership subject to financial punishments, not merely political ones. The new frontier could help solve an old problem — what to do about bad actors in its ranks — while creating new ones. Not least, it could invite the European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch, to exercise a new level of interference in the affairs of member states. How Mr. Orban has forced the European Union to such a juncture, and why it seemed helpless to stop him for so long, says much about the bloc’s founding assumptions and why it has stumbled in the face of populist and nationalist challenges. Interviews with over a dozen current and former European officials show how sentiments toward Mr. Orban and his illiberal project evolved from complacency and incomprehension to a recognition that he had become a serious internal threat — despite Hungary’s having fewer people than the Paris metropolitan area and a language so esoteric that it bears no relationship to those of its neighbors. The willful neglect was encapsulated neatly in 2015 at a meeting, when Jean-Claude Juncker, then the European Commission’s president, saw Mr. Orban arriving and said, “The dictator is coming,” before greeting him with “dictator,” and giving him a friendly pat on the face. No one in power wanted to confront Mr. Orban over issues like rule of law and corruption — especially not his fellow national leaders, who each have a seat on the powerful European Council. “At the council myself I felt the reluctance of Orban’s peers to deal with these kind of issues,” said Luuk van Middelaar, an aide to Herman Van Rompuy when he was council president. He added that the council was “like a club, where Viktor is just one of them — and they are political animals, and they respect each other for the simple fact of having won an election.” The leaders “prefer not to deal with hot potatoes or each other’s business when they can avoid it,” Mr. van Middelaar said. Mr. Orban faces new elections this spring against a formally united but extremely diverse set of opposition parties. But he has become a model for the politics of identity and religion, not just in its E.U. ally, Poland, but in the United States, as well. On Monday, former President Donald J. Trump endorsed Mr. Orban for re-election, pledging “complete support.” Mr. Orban was an early supporter of Mr. Trump, endorsing him in the summer of 2016 and again in 2020. Mr. Orban, said Mr. Trump, was “probably, like me, a little bit controversial, but that’s OK.” Some European lawmakers recognized early on that Mr. Orban was trampling on democratic norms but were stymied by national leaders, particularly those from the European People’s Party, the powerful center-right political grouping that has dominated the European Parliament for the past decade. Among those conservatives who protected Mr. Orban was Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany at the time. German companies had major investments in Hungary, and Ms. Merkel saw the Hungarian leader as a political ally in Brussels. One prominent member of the European People’s Party said Ms. Merkel and her aides brushed off complaints about Mr. Orban, saying that he could be difficult, but that it was important to keep him in the family. “The biggest failing — the one that we are still paying the price for today — is the European Council,” said Rui Tavares, a former European legislator who helped write a report on Hungary’s violations adopted in 2013. “The European Council did nothing.” When Mr. Orban proposed — and later introduced — a new Constitution that violated European principles, Didier Reynders, then Belgium’s minister of foreign and European affairs, said he tried to raise the problem in a meeting with E.U. leaders in 2011 but was shut down. “The reaction was that this is not an issue for the member states,” said Mr. Reynders, who is now the E.U. commissioner for justice, adding that “maybe the commission, maybe the court” should deal with it. “But now it’s a permanent discussion,” he said. Ivan Krastev, a Bulgarian analyst of Europe, said Mr. Orban was careful for several years after his election in 2010 “not to cross Brussels’s red lines but to dance along them in what he called ‘the peacock dance.’” Mr. Krastev said many European leaders assumed that the nations that joined the bloc in 2004 would be grateful, relatively compliant partners and miscalculated how “countries like Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic felt later that you have to assert your own identity and reject Brussels to differing degrees.” Mr. Orban’s party adopted the new Constitution and a new media law that curbed press freedom. It overhauled the country’s justice system, removed the head of its Supreme Court and created an office to oversee the courts led by the wife of a prominent member of the governing party, Fidesz. Election laws were changed to favor the party. External factors strengthened Mr. Orban as well, including in 2015 when a record number of migrants made their way to Europe and when the right-wing Law and Justice party of Jaroslaw Kaczynski came to power in Poland. He suddenly had an ally there, and his tough stance against migrants won him support elsewhere, too. “What liberated Orban was 2015 and the migration crisis,” said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “He was suddenly standing for more than Hungary but for wider issues of migration, with support in Germany and Austria and the other Central European states, and that gave him power.” A sharper inflection point came in May 2018 at a meeting between Mr. Orban and the leaders of the European People’s Party: Joseph Daul, the party president, and Manfred Weber, the German Christian Democrat who ran Parliament. They warned him that his party risked being expelled from the parliamentary grouping. Fresh from another electoral victory the month before, Mr. Orban “felt he was on steroids” and struck back, according to an official who was immediately briefed about the meeting. “If you try to kick me out, I’ll destroy you,” Mr. Orban said, according to the official. It would take 10 months before Fidesz would be suspended. Two years after that, in March, Mr. Orban quit the conservative alliance when it became clear that it was going to oust his party. Mr. Weber still regrets the loss of Fidesz. “On one level, it is a relief,” he said. “But Orban leaving is not a victory, but a defeat” in the effort to hold the center-right together as “a broad people’s party.” It has helped Mr. Orban that the European Union has few and ineffective instruments for punishing a backsliding nation. Even the Lisbon Treaty, which gave enhanced powers to the European Parliament, has essentially one unusable tool: Article 7, which can remove a country’s voting rights, but only if passed by unanimity. In 2017, Frans Timmermans, then the European Commission first vice president responsible for the rule of law, initiated the article against Poland. The European Parliament did the same against Hungary in 2018. But both measures inevitably stalled because the two countries protect each other. The treaty also allows the commission to bring infringement procedures — legal charges — against member states for violating E.U. law. But the process is slow, involving letters and responses and appeals, and final decisions are up to the European Court of Justice. Most cases are settled before reaching the court. But according to studies by R. Daniel Kelemen of Rutgers University and Tommaso Pavone of the University of Oslo, the commission sharply reduced infringement cases after the addition of new member states in 2004. José Manuel Barroso, a former commission president, “bought into this to work more cooperatively with governments and not just sue them,” Mr. Kelemen said. Mr. Barroso declined to comment. Attitudes have shifted. With taxpayer money at stake, the next seven-year budget in the balance and the disregard for shared values shown by Mr. Orban and Mr. Kaczynski on leaders’ minds, Brussels may have finally found a useful tool to affect domestic politics, with a mix of lawsuits charging infringement of European treaties combined with severe financial consequences. A marker has finally been laid down, Mr. Reynders said. The big moment comes this month, when the European Court of Justice issues its ruling. If Hungary and Poland lose the case, as expected, it is unclear what will happen if both countries simply refuse to comply. The European Union will be thrust deeper into unknown territory."

Trump as part of a civil investigation into his business practices, is also seeking to question two of his adult children as part of the inquiry. The involvement of the children, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, was disclosed in court documents filed on Monday as the Trump Organization sought to block lawyers for the attorney general, Letitia James, from questioning the former president and his children. The subpoenas for the former president and two of his children were served on Dec. 1, according to one of the documents. Eric Trump, another of Mr. Trump’s sons, was already questioned by Ms. James’s office in October 2020. The attorney general’s effort to interview Mr. Trump under oath became public last month, but it was not previously known that her office, which has been conducting a civil investigation into the former president’s business practices for almost three years, was also looking to question Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump. Ms. James’s civil inquiry is focused on whether Mr. Trump fraudulently inflated the value of his assets to secure bank loans while understating them elsewhere to reduce his tax bill. Her office has subpoenaed a number of documents as part of her scrutiny of many Trump Organization properties, including the Seven Springs estate in Westchester County and the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago. If her lawyers find evidence of wrongdoing, the office can file a lawsuit. As the inquiry is a civil one, Ms. James cannot file criminal charges. But Ms. James’s office is also involved in the separate criminal investigation now being led by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, who was sworn in on Saturday. The previous district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., who had been supervising the investigation for more than three years, left office at the end of the year. In their motion filed Monday to block the questioning, lawyers for the Trump Organization and the family argued that Ms. James was attempting to improperly sidestep the grand jury process in the criminal investigation by questioning the Trump family members under oath as part of the civil inquiry. By doing so, the lawyers argued, Ms. James would be able to obtain information valuable to the criminal investigation from the family members without having to give them the immunity from prosecution that New York law would require were they to testify before a grand jury. “She cannot wear two hats and do a civil investigation and a criminal investigation with the D.A. at the same time,” said a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Ronald P. Fischetti, adding that Ms. James had politicized her role as attorney general. Alan S. Futerfas, a lawyer who represents Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, called the attorney general’s actions “unprecedented” and argued that the “subpoenas circumvent the rights to grand jury protections we all have.” In a statement, Ms. James said: “These delay tactics will not stop us from following the facts or the law, which is why we will be asking the court to compel Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump to testify with our office under oath. Our investigation will continue undeterred.” Asked about the argument in the motion, Bruce Green, who directs a center for legal ethics at Fordham University, said that the Trump family members would still be able to invoke their right against self-incrimination if Ms. James’s office won the right to question them. Mr. Green said that lawyers for the family would have to show, rather than simply state, that Ms. James was abusing the civil process to gather evidence for the criminal case. Refusing to testify could hurt the Trump family in the civil inquiry, as judges and juries in civil actions are allowed to take such refusals into account. But prosecutors in criminal cases are barred from using defendants’ silence against them. Mr. Trump’s three elder children — Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric — have long been deeply involved in their father’s company, the Trump Organization, which each of them joined shortly after graduating from college. When Mr. Trump became president in 2017, he turned the business over to Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, as well as the company’s longtime chief financial officer, Allen H. Weisselberg. Ms. Trump took an office in the West Wing. Mr. Weisselberg and the Trump Organization were indicted in July as part of the criminal inquiry and accused by Mr. Vance’s prosecutors of running a tax-avoidance scheme in which executives were compensated with off-the-books benefits. Lawyers for Mr. Weisselberg have said that he will fight the charges in court. Last month, lawyers for Mr. Trump filed a lawsuit against Ms. James, seeking to halt her civil inquiry and to bar her participation in the criminal investigation. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Albany, argued that Ms. James had violated Mr. Trump’s political rights and that her actions had been “guided solely by political animus.” “Neither Mr. Trump nor the Trump Organization get to dictate if and where they will answer for their actions,” Ms. James said in response. Her office has not yet responded to the lawsuit in court."

Getting her fourth and fifth shots was trickier. By July, pharmacy records in the Houston area where she lives finally showed her prior shots. Armed with a doctor’s note explaining that she had not developed antibodies, Ms. Ricks convinced a pharmacist to give her two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine over the summer. “She kept saying, ‘There’s no clinical data here,’” Ms. Ricks recalled. “And I said, ‘Hey, I am the clinical data.’” Ms. Ricks is one of many people with compromised immune systems in the United States who have sidestepped government guidelines and received unauthorized fourth or fifth shots. The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are in charge of determining when additional doses should be administered, but some patients and their doctors feel that federal agencies have acted too slowly to protect the most vulnerable. Israel has already begun rolling out fourth shots — Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announced on Sunday that the country would offer additional shots to people age 60 and over, as well as to medical workers, becoming the first country to roll out an additional booster so broadly. By comparison, the C.D.C. updated its guidelines in late October to say that immunocompromised groups would be eligible for a fourth dose six months after a third. For those who followed the rules, the earliest eligibility for a fourth would be in late February. But as new variants like Omicron arise and vaccination rates continue to be sluggish in many areas, worrying those with weak immune systems, many of them are getting extra shots without being certain of whether they are safe or effective. Typically, doctors have discretion to use approved medications outside of their recommended uses — so a fully approved vaccine like Pfizer’s could normally be prescribed as doctors see fit. But, in order to receive and administer any Covid-19 vaccines, providers must sign a legal agreement with the C.D.C. — meaning that if they break the agency’s rules, they risk being kicked out of the vaccination program and could face prosecution. The C.D.C. also previously warned that providers administering unapproved shots may not have protection from patients’ legal claims if something goes wrong. Legal experts say the government has done little to enforce compliance with regulations and seems unlikely to pursue punishments for most providers. People taking the extra shots are not doing anything illegal. They could face civil lawsuits if vaccine providers decide to go after them for lying, but that is extremely unlikely, according to Govind Persad, an assistant professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law. The F.D.A. and C.D.C. did not respond to questions. Getting extra shots seems to have worked for some — to a degree. After Ms. Ricks’s fifth shot, her doctor sent her a note stating that she had developed a “moderate” antibody response but “still not a typical response.” She has continued taking extra precautions as if she is unvaccinated. Researchers say some immunocompromised people — depending on their condition and the medications they take — may never generate an immune system response, no matter how many shots they receive. Doctors and advocates for the extra doses say the United States has a surplus of vaccines, so the alternative is often letting them go to waste. Higher levels of antibodies seem to correlate with better protection against the virus, but researchers are not sure exactly what level of protection different numbers of antibodies provide, and the F.D.A. does not recommend that people use antibody tests to gauge immunity. The C.D.C. estimates there are about seven million immunocompromised individuals in the country, but it is difficult to know who will benefit from additional doses, according to Dr. Robert Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “This is, at this point, probably more improv than science,” he said. With the blessing of his transplant team, Chris Neblett, who recently moved to Indiana, Pa., got a third shot in April. Mr. Neblett, 44, had no idea whether it could help him — the medications he takes for his kidney transplant suppress his immune system and stopped him from generating antibodies after two shots of the Pfizer vaccine. “Sure, we were skirting the rules, but what were the repercussions?” he said. “There weren’t really any.” He generated low levels of antibodies after his third Pfizer shot, but it was not until his fourth shot in November that his antibody levels matched a normal, healthy individual’s response. Mr. Neblett believes that his gamble served the greater good — he is enrolled in a Johns Hopkins Hospital study on organ transplant patients’ responses to coronavirus vaccines. His data and that of those who also acted outside of official guidelines helped convince the C.D.C. and F.D.A. to authorize third shots for vulnerable groups, according to Dr. Dorry Segev, a transplant surgeon at Johns Hopkins University who works on the study. He said hundreds of patients in his study got unauthorized shots. “They’re acting out of desperation,” he said, adding, “Rather than say, ‘Shame on them,’ I would say, ‘Shame on the system we’ve created.’” While there could be some risks to additional shots, such as overstimulating the immune system, Dr. Segev said risks could be monitored carefully. Generally, he said, his data shows that additional vaccine doses should be safe and can work in some cases. “If three doses didn’t work at all, we probably should consider something different for that fourth dose,” Dr. Segev said. One example, he said, is to try reducing or stopping immune-suppressing medication before giving out additional doses if possible. He is one of many doctors complaining that the C.D.C.’s guidance is overly rigid and prevents medical professionals from treating patients on a case-by-case basis. Karen Pearce’s doctor has written her a note that the timing of her booster “MUST be done prior to her next chemotherapy infusion,” a treatment she needs every six months to control a life-threatening inflammatory blood vessel disease. But Ms. Pearce, 69, from Gettysburg, Pa., will not be eligible for a fourth shot until February, right after she is supposed to receive her next infusion, which she and her doctor both believe would render her fourth shot useless. This booster shot has taken on added importance with Omicron, but no providers have agreed to give it to her one month early. “More flexibility in their guidance could save lives, maybe mine,” she said. Other experts say there are limits to how flexible guidance can be. Getting additional doses too soon could be counterproductive, according to Shane Crotty, a professor at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology’s Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research. This is because the immune system’s long-term memory seems to perform better if it can rest between two vaccines, he explained, and the body takes months to perfect its antibody-making process after an initial vaccination. One potential alternative to more shots involves using monoclonal antibodies to protect patients, said Dr. Lianne S. Gensler, a rheumatologist at the University of California, San Francisco. Most monoclonal antibody treatments have been in short supply — meaning they have only been used as a post-exposure treatment instead of a preventive measure. To make matters worse, Omicron rendered some existing monoclonal antibody treatments ineffective. The F.D.A. approved one long-term preventive monoclonal antibody treatment specifically meant for vulnerable populations in December, but doses may initially be limited. Meanwhile, people with compromised immune systems ponder their imperfect options. Patrick VanHorn, 67, of Ventura, Calif., has chronic leukemia and needs his immune-suppressing medication to stay alive. He produced no antibodies after his fourth dose of the Moderna vaccine in August. He is discussing a fifth shot with his doctors but is not sure if he will go through with it. “Right now, my thinking is, why bother?” he asked. “Nothing has happened in these first four shots. Why do I think a fifth shot would do something different?”"

Trump endorsed Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, on Monday, formally pledging his “complete support” to a far-right foreign leader who has touted turning his country into an “illiberal state.” Mr. Orban and his party have steadily consolidated power in Hungary by weakening the country’s independent and democratic institutions — rewriting election laws to favor his Fidesz party, changing school textbooks, curbing press freedoms, overhauling the Constitution and changing the composition of the judiciary. The actions have caused consternation in the European Union, to which Hungary belongs, but also made Mr. Orban something of a cause célèbre in conservative American political circles, following years of an aggressive influence operation to bolster his image in the United States. Last fall, Tucker Carlson, the top-rated Fox News host, broadcast from Budapest for a week, calling the nation a place “with a lot of lessons for the rest of us.” Former Vice President Mike Pence visited Hungary last year for a conference on conservative values. And the American Conservative Union has been promoting plans for a gathering there, dubbed #CPACHungary, later this year. Mr. Orban was an early supporter of Mr. Trump, endorsing him in the summer of 2016. After he won, Mr. Trump granted Mr. Orban a meeting in the Oval Office in 2019. The Hungarian leader had been denied such an audience since 1998. After that meeting, Mr. Trump said Mr. Orban was “probably, like me, a little bit controversial, but that’s OK.” Mr. Orban again publicly backed Mr. Trump in 2020. Now, Mr. Trump is doing the same for Mr. Orban ahead of the Hungarian elections, scheduled for this spring. In his endorsement on Monday, Mr. Trump hailed Mr. Orban as a “strong leader” who has “done a powerful and wonderful job in protecting Hungary, stopping illegal immigration, creating jobs, trade, and should be allowed to continue to do so in the upcoming election.” It is Mr. Trump’s second endorsement of a foreign leader since leaving the White House. He endorsed Jair Bolsonaro, the president of Brazil, last year."
204,The New York Times,nytimes,"The end of an era: Blackberry is ending service on its mobile devices on Jan. 4, 2022.",https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3mPWObm%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2VGnhyf7rtY5XEgW_Q6I-56PFpHJ6vgchE4BFYmJ7VfBxOWv1WneMDkxA&h=AT3OkQGL78hhW6eyVbpoAPmjwStqTljLJfZWMmyDMINzxrmnEXVmcwqujepM4UgoEeQI-umIF0xNUwYnkp_IdBNlRhob_kO2EJ0Oo9akH-fwIQeecB8j0PKmIcOXavoY3WiZyANOiaEtMaP5wkUa&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT1NcqoqhDCx4q951ox6EtxByJ4lXq9xNhV8BF0Irrz7xjLs8Bbove1Ohh1Ky_J9U6JDenmYyjOwyAJKCqHVYV1sguflHwd1ZgZVY5-3Fn9JvthHI1IHgP08ze0H9oG0y1cyJITzjbrWIwY_onH9BdX8HytdWRvATdcCinCgnDzMPO1e,3d,"Most U.S. doctors have no way to determine which variant of the coronavirus a patient is carrying, a distinction that could mean the difference between life and death. High-risk patients carrying the Delta variant could benefit greatly from two particular monoclonal antibody treatments shown to reduce hospitalization and death. But those medications would most likely do nothing for patients with Omicron, who would only respond to a third antibody treatment that is in very short supply. While U.S. officials have endorsed using a workaround test that can identify Omicron’s genetic signature, experts say it’s not feasible for large health systems facing a crush of patients to employ in each case. That makes treating patients challenging in places like Maryland, where cases are spiking and Omicron accounts for roughly 58 percent of them. The Delta variant is also holding strong in the Great Plains and swaths of the West, including California. While there is no approved test to determine each individual’s variant, a national network of state and other labs use genome-sequencing tests to track variants broadly in communities. Health systems then use those regional estimates or their own data to decide which antibody treatments to use in their clinics and hospitals. Many of them concluded that a community of largely Delta patients would benefit most from the antibody drugs made by Regeneron and Eli Lilly, while communities where Omicron patients are predominant would benefit from antibodies from GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology. Federal officials have dabbled with making the decision for the nation. On Dec. 23, they stopped shipments of antibody treatments by Eli Lilly and Regeneron after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 73 percent of U.S. Covid cases were Omicron. An outcry followed from Republican political leaders, who argued that some people in their states were still infected with Delta. And on Tuesday, the C.D.C. slashed its estimate of national Omicron cases to 59 percent. On Dec. 31, federal officials resumed national shipping all of the antibody treatments. For the next few weeks, as the country grapples with this uneven mix of both variants, tailoring treatments to each patient will be “extraordinarily difficult,” said Dr. Alex Greninger, assistant director of the clinical virology laboratories at the University of Washington Medical Center. Dr. Greninger is credited with developing one of the first tests to detect the coronavirus in the United States. But he is pessimistic that health systems can pivot quickly to sort out which patients have Delta or Omicron. And although a shortcut test can detect Omicron, there’s no simple way to report the results in bulk, he said. What’s more, the genome sequencing used by public health officials takes nearly a week — too long to target the early antibody treatments that have been found to reduce the need for hospitalizations. That makes patient care particularly difficult right now, said Dr. Mark Siedner, an infectious disease clinician and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital. In Massachusetts and nearby states, an estimated 44.5 percent of cases are Omicron. Dr. Siedner said his health system has stopped using the Regeneron and Eli Lilly antibodies that are not effective against Omicron and are “anxiously awaiting” more doses of the effective treatment by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology. “We’re in a holding pattern and it’s a terrible time to be in that place,” he said. Officials across the United States, from President Biden on down, have been insisting that they are no longer in the shutdown business, and will not order any closures to contain the latest surge in coronavirus cases. But Omicron may be taking the decision out of their hands. So many workers are testing positive or calling in sick that businesses, schools, government agencies and more are being crippled by staff shortages that may force them to close some operations anyway. Airlines began canceling flights in large numbers on Christmas Eve for lack of crews, and the problems have continued into the new year. Broadway shows have been canceled because of outbreaks backstage. Major companies have delayed or entirely jettisoned return-to-office plans. Many colleges are switching back to virtual classes to start the semester. And public school leaders are struggling to respond to a situation that has changed greatly from when students went on holiday breaks before Christmas, barely a week ago. Four large city school systems — Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Newark — have joined a growing list of public schools around the country that put off reopening on Monday, switched to remote instruction, or both. Covid-19 outbreaks and staffing shortages forced their hands. Omicron has driven case numbers to staggering new heights: The United States is averaging more than 484,600 daily cases over the past week, a 238 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are up 41 percent in the past two weeks, while deaths are down by 3 percent. In some cases, the very resources needed to cope with Omicron’s staffing disruptions are themselves being disrupted, from the call-center agents who rebook canceled flights to the frontline medical professionals who care for sick workers. Infected police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and transit workers are leaving shifts unfilled. In New York City, subway lines have been delayed by staff shortages, and the Fire Department has asked residents not to call 911 except in a real emergency. Many elected leaders of both parties have discarded their sharpest pandemic-curbing tools, like closing government offices, schools and businesses, which have come with staggering economic, social and political costs. Instead, elected officials have stressed the importance of vaccination, booster shots and mask-wearing. “I am not prepared to shut down schools or the economy at this time,” Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York, a Democrat, said before New York suffered a string of new daily case records last week. “I will not overreact and send this economy spiraling out of control once again.” Many leading public health experts aren’t seeking shutdowns, either. If anything, many appear to be taking an opposite tack. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced new guidelines to help schools stay open, by allowing children who are exposed to the coronavirus to “test to stay” instead of automatically having to quarantine at home. And it has said that some Americans who test positive can leave isolation after five days, half as long as previous recommendations. A federal judge granted a preliminary injunction on Monday blocking the Department of Defense from taking “any adverse action” against 35 Navy sailors who have refused to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, arguing that it violated their religious freedoms. The service members — including Navy SEALs and members of the Naval Special Warfare Command — had filed suit against the Biden administration arguing that their “sincerely held religious beliefs forbid each of them from receiving the Covid-19 vaccine for a variety of reasons based upon their Christian faith.” The Pentagon had mandated that all active-duty troops receive the vaccine. The judge, Reed O’Connor of the Northern District of Texas, effectively blocked the department from punishing those troops. “Our nation asks the men and women in our military to serve, suffer, and sacrifice. But we do not ask them to lay aside their citizenry and give up the very rights they have sworn to protect,” Judge O’Connor wrote in his 26-page order. He added: “The Covid-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no Covid-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.” The group represents a small fraction of active-duty troops from the United States, and as of mid-December, most active-duty soldiers and members of the Navy had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Thousands have requested religious exemptions, and none have been granted so far, officials said in December. The decision follows another injunction by a judge in November against President Biden’s national vaccine mandate for health care workers. Judge O’Connor, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, has reliably tossed several Democratic policies that have been challenged on the federal bench. In response to the injunction on Monday, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, wrote on Twitter, “This is a major win!” A spokesperson for the Pentagon could not immediately be reached for comment. But on Monday evening, John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said that defense officials were reviewing the injunction, according to The Washington Post. The coronavirus is spreading faster than ever at the start of 2022, but the last days of 2021 brought some encouraging news about the latest wave of infections. With growing evidence that the Omicron variant produces less severe illness than in earlier waves, governments are redoubling their focus on vaccinations and boosters, which are increasingly seen as the world’s ticket to “living with Covid.” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert, said on Sunday that hospitalizations, which are not rising as fast, were a more important barometer than reported cases for the severity of the Omicron wave, a sharp distinction after nearly two years of tallying daily case counts. “As you get further on and the infections become less severe, it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations as opposed to the total number of cases,” Dr. Fauci said. Still, the case numbers remain staggering. The world is recording an average of nearly 1.5 million new cases every day, twice as many per day as were recorded nearly a week ago, although the figures in many places may have been distorted by holiday reporting delays. In the United States, experts forecast that the Omicron wave could crest in mid-January, but not before millions were infected every week. Across Europe, caseloads have soared to new highs and ushered in another bitter winter of social restrictions, mask mandates and shifting travel rules. The holidays made things worse as colder weather and festive gatherings drove people indoors, where the virus circulates more easily. Airports and mass transit hubs were snarled with travelers after many people stayed home last year. And with many government offices closed, testing and case data were not being compiled as regularly, leaving officials and experts, at least temporarily, with an incomplete picture of how bad things were getting. As much of the world returns to work this week, however, several trends are becoming clearer: Although many governments are loath to lock down again, officials are tweaking rules to account for Omicron’s blazing spread. Paris last week became the latest European city to reimpose an outdoor mask mandate. South Korea joined France and others in setting an expiry date for its vaccine passes, hoping to push more people to get boosters. Here are some other trends to watch for: Mayor Eric Adams insisted on Monday morning that New York City’s schools would stay open despite an extraordinary surge in Omicron cases. But about a third of city parents did not send their children back to classrooms on the first day after the holiday break. Attendance was just over 67 percent, slightly higher than the low point of 65 percent the system reached on the day before winter break. Throughout the day on Monday, Adams was adamant that the system would remain open. He repeated the message in a series of television interviews and after his first official school visit since taking office on New Year’s Day. “We’re really excited about the opening of our schools,” Mr. Adams said outside the school, Concourse Village Elementary School in the Bronx. “We want to be extremely clear: the safest place for our children is a school building.” Mr. Adams said that remote learning had been disastrous for too many of the city’s nearly one million schoolchildren in the nation’s largest school district, and had been particularly harmful for children in low-income neighborhoods and homeless students. But the calm that Mr. Adams sought to project was not shared by the many parents and educators who greeted Monday morning with profound trepidation. After roughly a year of remarkably low virus transmission in schools, Covid cases soared in the week before the winter break, prompting the closures of 11 schools and over 400 classrooms, and the contact tracing system for city schools effectively collapsed amid the surge. New York City reported 35,650 new virus cases on Sunday, with a 7-day average test positivity rate of nearly 22 percent, according to state data. Some families and elected officials have called on Mr. Adams to delay the start of school by a few days to allow every child and educator to get tested. And teachers have raised questions about how schools will be properly staffed with so many teachers sick with the virus or quarantining due to exposures. “This is an all hands on deck moment,” Mr. Adams said, acknowledging that administrators who are not normally in the classroom would be used to address staff shortages if necessary. Mr. Adams has endorsed a plan created by former Mayor Bill de Blasio that is designed to keep more classrooms open as the surge continues. The plan calls for distributing 1.5 million rapid at-home test kits to schools. Starting Monday, the city is also doubling its random in-school testing program to give P.C.R. tests to 20 percent of consenting children in each school weekly. But most families have not opted in to allow their children to be tested, which has made the testing pool very small at some schools. The mayor and the new schools chancellor, David C. Banks, are betting that their plan to increase testing will prevent major outbreaks. “We’re going to turn those question marks into an exclamation point: we’re staying open,” Mr. Adams said. Mr. Adams and Mr. Banks have so far resisted calls to mandate booster shots for educators or vaccines for children. The mayor has said a decision will be made this spring about mandating vaccines for students for the fall. “We’re not at the point of mandate,” Mr. Adams said Monday, as he encouraged eligible New Yorkers to get vaccinated and boosted. Michael Mulgrew, president of the city’s teachers’ union, said in an email to members that he had encouraged Mr. Adams to start the year remotely. But on Monday morning, Mr. Mulgrew said he was working closely with the new mayor and that schools had been some of the safest places in the city throughout the pandemic. Later on Monday, Gov. Kathy Hochul reiterated her commitment to keeping New York’s children in schools. “My view is that every child should be back in school unless they are testing positive,” she said. The state has distributed 5.2 million at-home test kits to schools thus far, and another 3.8 million arrived yesterday and have yet to be distributed. Under the current rule, test kits will only be provided to students for known exposures that occur in classrooms, although Ms. Hochul said that policy was under review. She also cautioned against a return to remote learning. “The teachers did the best they could. The parents did the best they could,” she said. “But we ask too much.” In particular, she spoke about the effects of remote learning on children in communities of color, those who lacked resources and those without high-speed internet access — an existing digital divide that she said had widened into a “digital canyon.” “We cannot have that,” Ms. Hochul said. “That was an injustice. We cannot have that anymore.” SACRAMENTO — With the Omicron variant raging across California, millions of schoolchildren returned to classrooms on Monday, ending the holiday break as many had spent it — masked, distanced, apprehensive and in long lines with their parents, scrambling for coronavirus tests. Few schools were closed in a state whose Covid-19 precautions have been among the most aggressive in the nation. California has managed to maintain comparatively low rates of virus-related deaths and hospitalizations. But infections have soared recently because of the highly contagious variant, which appears to result in less severe cases. In hundreds of districts, in-person instruction was conditioned on heightened health requirements and fraught with the understanding that even those might not prevent a return to remote learning. “Frankly, the disruption I’m worried about isn’t Day 1 — it’s Day 2, 3 or 4 if we get 30 or 40 or 50 positive cases,” said Alex Cherniss, the superintendent of the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, where, after days of impassioned community debate, some 10,000 students in coastal Los Angeles County returned to class on Monday. “People are exhausted here,” he said. California’s largest school district, Los Angeles Unified, was not scheduled to resume classes until next week. But on Monday, the district issued new rules requiring baseline testing as a condition of returning to campus, regardless of vaccination status. Previously, testing had been optional for vaccinated and asymptomatic students and employees. In many other districts, reopening classrooms on Monday also hinged on fresh rounds of coronavirus testing. In Marin County, students had been given kits to test for the virus before re-entering campus. In Sacramento County, families stood for hours over the weekend at testing sites hastily erected by school districts or took advantage of an infusion of six million take-home tests the state supplied to districts across California as Omicron was starting to spike. “We did two tests at home and he’s fine,” Emily Ramey said as she dropped off her younger child at a middle school in suburban Sacramento. “I’m just hoping that everyone else tested, too.” Los Angeles Unified already conducts the nation’s largest weekly school-based coronavirus testing program, but health officials in the county have ratcheted up other measures that will affect the hundreds of thousands of students and employees in the school system, along with those in private schools and nearly 80 other public school districts. New health rules starting Jan. 1 mandate, for example, that returning students at all of the county’s districts wear face masks not only indoors but also outside at recess, and that school employees upgrade to medical-grade N95 or KN95 face coverings. Gov. Gavin Newsom has reiterated that the state is “committed” to keeping classrooms open and promised last month to make home testing kits “available to every K-12 public school student as they head back to the classroom from winter break.” But not all districts had received their allotment by Monday. San Francisco schools increased mobile testing sites throughout the city and strongly encouraged students to get tested before returning, in part because they will not receive their allotment of tests from the state until later this week. In Palos Verdes, Mr. Cherniss said concern over Omicron almost prompted the district to delay reopening until next week. But when he announced he was considering it, he said, the outcry from parents was fierce. Eventually, the district opted to reopen as scheduled, but to strongly encourage students to test before returning. “We did a big push over the weekend,” he said. “We handed out 2,000 home tests in less than three hours and did another 2,000 live tests. More than 100 were positive.” The top medical official at the U.S. Capitol urged lawmakers and their staff members on Monday to work remotely and take additional precautions against the coronavirus, after the seven-day positivity rate at the building’s on-site coronavirus test center rose rapidly from less than 1 percent to more than 13 percent. In a letter to congressional offices obtained by The New York Times, Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician, informed lawmakers that there had been an “unprecedented number of cases” among hundreds of people who work in the Capitol complex, with dozens testing positive daily. Of the cases detected, 65 percent were symptomatic, the letter said. As of Dec. 15, a majority of the infections were breakthrough cases, with 61 percent caused by the Omicron variant and 38 percent caused by the Delta variant. The building offers daily testing for lawmakers, their staffs, Capitol workers and journalists who work in the building, and lawmakers were among the first wave of eligible people to receive vaccinations and boosters in the country. The breakthrough infections, Dr. Monahan said, had not led to any hospitalizations, serious complications or deaths. “I urge all individuals also to continue essential measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus,” Dr. Monahan wrote in his letter, encouraging lawmakers to maximize the amount of remote work done in their offices and advising all people in the building to use medical-grade masks. With the Senate set to hold votes on Tuesday, Democrats have now decided to meet virtually for their weekly caucus lunch, according to a senior aide. The House is not set to return until Jan. 10. Dr. Monahan has little authority to enforce his guidance, in an institution where individual congressional offices can set their own policies and guidelines. Mask-wearing in recent months has largely been divided along party lines, with two Republicans, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Andrew Clyde, incurring more than $100,000 combined in fines for flouting the mask mandate on the House floor. The Food and Drug Administration on Monday authorized booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds, a group that became eligible for initial shots in May. Regulators also shortened by a month the amount of time that adult and adolescent recipients of Pfizer’s vaccine should wait between their second and third doses, allowing them to seek booster shots five months after their second injections.  And they allowed some children aged 5 to 11 with immune deficiencies to seek a third shot, including those who have undergone solid organ transplants or have conditions that amount to “an equivalent level of immunocompromise,” the agency said in a statement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee is set to meet Wednesday to review the F.D.A. moves and decide whether to recommend the changes. If it does, the C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, is expected to quickly sign off on them.   The F.D.A. said that it examined data from Israel on more than 6,300 people in the 12- to 15-year-old age group who received booster shots at least five months after a second dose. That data “enabled the F.D.A. to reassess the benefits and risks of the use of a booster in the younger adolescent population in the setting of the current surge in Covid-19 cases,” the agency said. The review showed no new safety concerns, including no new cases of myocarditis, a rare heart-related side effect that has been tied to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, particularly in younger men. The condition involves inflammation of the heart muscle. Dr. Peter Marks, who oversees the agency’s division that regulates vaccines, said that the risk of myocarditis was substantially lower after a booster dose than after a second dose, citing U.S. safety monitoring data. The benefits of a third shot outweighed the potential risks, he said, because it may better protect individuals against both the Delta and Omicron variants. Regulators also relied on Israeli data in shortening the interval between second and third doses of the Pfizer vaccine. No new safety issues have emerged in the United States among more than four million people 16 and older who got a third dose at least five months after a second, the F.D.A. said.  Because studies have shown that a Pfizer booster dose increases protection against the Omicron variant, a shorter interval might offer “better protection sooner,” the agency said. Other studies have shown that the potency of two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine ebbs over time.  “We do know that waning has occurred by five months,” Dr. Janet Woodcock, the F.D.A.’s acting commissioner said at a Monday morning news conference at which she and Dr. Marks gave updates on their deliberations about whether to further expand authorizations for Covid vaccines. The F.D.A. has not received sufficient dataon the benefits of a booster shot of Moderna’s vaccine at five months, and so is sticking to the six-month interval for that vaccine. “We will obviously be receptive to data that are submitted to us from Moderna and we’ll take action on those data with all due speed,” Dr. Marks said. He declined to say whether authorization of a third shot was in the offing for those who received one dose of Johnson & Johnson and a second dose of either Pfizer or Moderna’s vaccine. He said the combination appears “to give a very good immune response,” but that more data is needed over time. Asked about booster shots for 5- to 11- year olds, Dr. Marks said that only about a quarter of them have been vaccinated, mostly in the last two months. “It would be great to get a larger percentage of those kids vaccinated, and then we’ll see how many months afterward we need to get them boosted,” he said. No vaccine is yet authorized for children under five. “We certainly understand that there is a pressing need in that age range,” Dr. Marks said, promising that the F.D.A. “will move with appropriate speed with the appropriate data in hand.” Hospitalizations for the coronavirus are rising steeply in New York State, approaching the peak of last winter’s surge and driving the number of deaths reported in a single day above 100 for the first time since last March, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday. Hospitalizations have now surpassed last winter’s peak in New York City, the governor said. She added that there were some signs that this wave of hospitalizations may not be as severe as past surges, but she said the rapid rise was still “a trend that is troubling.” “We’re not in a good place, I’m going to be really honest with you,” Ms. Hochul said at a news briefing in Rochester, as she announced additional testing sites and the arrival of millions of rapid tests to help schools stay open through the virus spike.  Hospitalizations are being closely watched in New York City, one of the first places to be hit hard by the Omicron variant, as a bellwether for the nation as a whole. Omicron was first reported in New York City a month ago, and led to an enormous surge in new cases, from less than 2,500 per day to nearly 50,000 per day on New Year’s Eve. But in the past 10 days, hospitalizations have started to rise even more steeply than cases in New York City, leaping 130 percent between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve, compared to a 60 percent rise in cases over the same period, state data shows. As of Sunday, more than 4,500 people were hospitalized in the city, 500 of them in intensive care units. Statewide, nearly 9,000 people were hospitalized, and 103 people were reported to have died on Sunday. The number of Covid patients in New York City intensive care units is still lower than the peak of last winter’s surge, before vaccines were widely available, when about 750 people were in intensive care. And hospitalizations remain much lower than when Covid-19 first swept the city in spring 2020 and 12,000 people were hospitalized on the worst days, 3,000 of them in intensive care. Unvaccinated people are far more likely to be hospitalized with Covid-19 than vaccinated people, state data shows. In the week ending Dec. 20, the rate of unvaccinated people hospitalized for Covid statewide was 30 per 100,000, compared to a rate of 2 per 100,000 for the fully vaccinated. The hospitalizations are threatening to wear down a health care system whose ranks are already thinned by infections and attrition during the pandemic, and hospitals are readying emergency staffing plans. More than 20 hospitals across the state have been ordered to stop elective surgeries because they lack the capacity to perform them. But Ms. Hochul said that some hospital executives have told her between 20 and 50 percent of their Covid patients are not suffering from severe symptoms, but that they are testing positive in the hospital incidentally, after being admitted for other reasons such as car accidents. As a result, beginning Tuesday, the state will begin to ask hospitals to break down how many patients are being admitted for acute Covid-19 symptoms, in an effort to further decipher this wave’s severity. “I just want to always want to be honest with New Yorkers about how bad this is,” Ms. Hochul said. “Yes, the sheer numbers of people infected are high, but I want to see if hospitalizations are correlated to that.” With schools open in New York City and much of the state on Monday, and masks still optional in certain fully vaccinated settings, some are calling on the city and state to do more to slow the hospitalizations down. Mark Levine, the Manhattan borough president, called on policymakers to immediately urge people to work from home and avoid large gatherings for the next two weeks, as part of a 16-point plan he released Monday. “Hospitalizations in NYC are rising faster than at any point since March 2020,” he wrote on Twitter. “We can’t just accept this. We have to do more to slow this wave.” The Omicron surge has prompted sharp new limits on the number of journalists allowed to attend White House news briefings. The board of the White House Correspondents Association voted on Sunday to limit attendance to 14 reporters, sitting spaced apart in a room with 49 chairs. Three major news agencies will always be represented, two spots are earmarked for major U.S. television networks, and there will be one pool reporter each for print, radio, TV and foreign outlets. The remaining five seats will be rotated on various schedules among 48 news organizations, including The New York Times. The president of the association, Steve Portnoy of CBS Radio, wrote in an email to members, “Given the virulence of the spread, medical experts have once again advised that it would be prudent to substantially reduce the number of people working in the cramped, poorly ventilated work space that we share.” He said that standing in the briefing room’s aisles, a common practice for reporters without assigned seats, “is not welcome at this time” because photographers need room to maintain social distance as they work. The association is also urging its members to stay away from the White House when not on a specific assignment, to minimize the chances of “an outbreak that might limit our ability to cover the president in close quarters,” Mr. Portnoy wrote. “I promise this won’t last a day longer than necessary,” he said in the email, adding that the board would revisit the situation by Jan. 21. As hospitals already strained by the Delta variant threaten to buckle under a crush of patients infected with the even more contagious Omicron, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci said Americans should focus more on the threat the winter wave poses to hospitals and less on the record number of cases. Over the past week, an average of more than 401,200 cases has been reported each day in the United States, tripling from two weeks ago and the first time the number has topped 400,000, according to a New York Times database (new case numbers are slightly depressed because fewer states are reporting after the New Year holiday). Hospitalizations were by comparison up 33 percent, however, to 92,300, while deaths had dropped 4 percent to an average of 1,249 daily. It’s unclear how many hospitalizations are patients infected with Omicron rather than the Delta variant, which scientists believe is significantly more virulent. According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the week ending Dec. 25, Omicron accounted for over 58 percent of new cases versus over 41 percent for Delta. Dr. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, noted on Sunday on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos” that many new infections, especially in people who are vaccinated and boosted, result in no symptoms or mild symptoms, making the absolute number of cases less important than it was for previous versions of the virus. “As you get further on and the infections become less severe, it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations as opposed to the total number of cases,” Dr. Fauci said. That advice is in keeping with what many epidemiologists have said all along. Despite the daily drumbeat of case counts, the number of positive tests has never been a perfect indicator of the course of the epidemic. The number of cases has exploded because the Omicron variant seems to be much more contagious and able to evade vaccines than other earlier variants, which has spurred more widespread testing. What’s more, the official numbers are almost certainly an undercount, because many people are testing positive on rapid at-home tests or carrying the virus without any symptoms. Yet, as Dr. Fauci told Mr. Stephanopoulos, the concern is not so much the mild or asymptomatic Omicron cases as it is the number of people with severe or fatal infections. “The real bottom line that you want to be concerned about,” he said, “is are we getting protected by the vaccines from severe disease leading to hospitalization?” So far, vaccines and boosters appear to be providing that protection. But the unvaccinated remain at risk. “I’m still very concerned about the tens of millions of people who are not vaccinated at all because even though many of them are going to get asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, a fair number of them are going to get severe disease,” Dr. Fauci said. The Louisiana Department of Health tweeted on Sunday that hospitalizations in the state have topped 1,000, and that 76 percent of those hospitalized “are not up to date” on their vaccination status. Also, even if Omicron is milder, as most evidence suggests, a higher caseload means more health care workers who cannot work because they test positive as well as more chances that people could get sick enough to require medical care. “We have got to be careful about that, because, even if you have a less of a percentage of severity, when you have multi-multi-multi-fold more people getting infected, the net amount is you’re still going to get a lot of people that are going to be needing hospitalization,” Dr. Fauci said.  Hospitals in several states are showing signs of strain and experiencing staffing shortages. “At the moment, the major concern is the effect of Omicron on hospital staffing in conjunction with fatigue and increasing admissions for Covid-19 as well as other things,” said Julio Figueroa, chief of infectious diseases at the Louisiana State School Health Sciences Center.  Hawaii has requested 700 additional health care workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, while some hospitals in the St. Louis area have started to limit visitors again. Leaders in Illinois have urged hospitals to postpone elective surgeries and procedures. The Maryland Hospital Association said that the number of hospital patients had surpassed the state’s Covid peak from last winter. “We believe that the next four to six weeks are really going to be a terrible point in this crisis, and it’s potentially going to be the worst part of the whole two-year fight,” Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland said on the CNN program “State of the Union.” Large city school systems in Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee and Newark have joined a growing list of public schools across the country that have postponed reopening after the holiday break, switched to remote instruction, or have taken both steps because of Covid-19 outbreaks and staffing shortages. Some of the announcements came abruptly, as school leaders struggled to respond to a rapidly changing situation. Some school systems that are open for in-person instruction this week have nonetheless had to shut some school buildings for lack of staff, including eight schools in Columbus, Ohio, and 12 in Pittsburgh. An increasing number of people with compromised immune systems in the U.S. are sidestepping government guidelines to receive unauthorized fourth or fifth shots. The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are in charge of determining when additional doses should be administered, but some patients and their doctors feel that federal agencies have acted too slowly to protect the most vulnerable. Israel has already begun officially offering fourth shots — Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announced on Sunday that the country would offer additional shots to people age 60 and over, as well as to medical workers, becoming the first country to start administering an additional booster so broadly. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidelines in late October to say that immunocompromised people would be eligible for a fourth dose six months after a third. For those who followed the rules, the earliest eligibility for a fourth would be in late February. But as new variants like Omicron arise and vaccination rates continue to be sluggish in many areas, worrying those with weak immune systems, many of them are getting extra shots without being certain of whether they are safe or effective. All secondary school students in England must be tested for the coronavirus before returning to classrooms after the holidays, the British government announced on Monday, in the latest measure aimed at controlling a rise in infections driven by the Omicron variant. Schools have been provided with rapid test kits to administer on site when pupils begin returning to classes this week, officials said, adding that students should continue to test themselves at least twice a week. Older students, including those at universities, had already been advised to test themselves at home before returning to campuses. “We are doing all we can to minimize disruption this virus causes to everyday life, including keeping children in school, and regular testing is a key way to support schools and protect face-to-face teaching,” Britain’s health minister, Sajid Javid, said in a statement. Self-administered rapid antigen tests — known in Britain as lateral-flow tests — have become a ubiquitous part of British life over the past year, provided free by the government through the mail and at pharmacies. Over the holidays, however, supply difficulties and surging demand have often made them more difficult to obtain, with officials blaming a “worldwide shortage.” Officials said on Monday that schools would have access to “a separate supply route” to order additional tests. The government also said that English secondary school students, though not their teachers, would be required to wear masks in classrooms until at least Jan. 26. Masks are already recommended for students in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, where separate devolved governments decide on their own Covid measures.  While those governments reintroduced restrictions on gatherings after Christmas, Mr. Javid and other British officials have said that further restrictions on everyday life in England are not necessary because cases of severe illness are not rising as fast as in previous waves.  Even as Britain recorded its all-time highs in daily cases last week, the health secretary said that the country has “some of the least restrictive measures in Europe,” and argued that high vaccination rates, including a scaled-up booster program, would allow Britons to live with the virus. “Curbs on our freedom must be an absolute last resort and the British people rightly expect us to do everything in our power to avert them,” Mr. Javid wrote in The Daily Mail newspaper on Friday. Data released by British health officials last week added to findings that Omicron might produce less severe illness than previous variants. Still, some experts warned that the sheer number of cases would strain Britain’s health system. Government data showed a 50 percent rise in both hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19 over the past week, with nearly 1,000 people having died within 28 days of a positive test. As of Monday, South Korea’s vaccine passes will have a six-month expiration date, as the health authorities seek to manage the country’s “living with Covid” strategy. Under the vaccine pass system, which started in mid-December, visitors to public places like restaurants, cafes, sports facilities and movie theaters must present proof of vaccination to gain access. (Proof of a recent negative P.C.R. test is also accepted.) With the tightened rules, those who received two doses of the coronavirus vaccine must get a booster shot within six months, or their vaccine passes — issued 14 days after getting a second dose — will be void. (Negative test results issued within 48 hours will still be accepted.) Fines or administrative action against violators will begin starting on Jan. 10, according to Yonhap News Agency. Both people who flout the rule and venues that fail to enforce it could face punishment. The vaccine pass system has spurred debate in South Korea over whether it is forcing people to take the vaccine. The country has fully vaccinated 83 percent of its population, according to Our World in Data, and on Monday Korean health officials reported 3,129 new daily cases of the virus. After weeks of record-breaking case counts, the country has had a 34 percent drop in daily cases over the past week. Other countries have also begun adding expiration dates to a primary vaccine regimen. Starting in February, the European Union Covid Certificate will have a validity period of nine months, and booster shots will be mandatory for travel across several countries on the continent. And beginning next week, the United Arab Emirates is set to bar people from leaving the country unless they have received three doses of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the state news agency WAM. Britain announced a goal to administer boosters to all adults by the end of the month, and Israel last week approved of a fourth shot for people with weak immune systems and others at high risk, including those 60 and over, and health care workers. The United States has been slower in its booster rollout, with only one-third of fully vaccinated adults receiving another shot as of mid-December. Chile will also offer its eligible residents a fourth coronavirus vaccine dose from February, President Sebastián Piñera announced. Health care workers, older people and those with chronic diseases would be given shots first. Vietnam has urged China, one of its major trading partners, to ease the measures local Chinese officials put in place at a key border crossing to fight the coronavirus, saying that the restrictions were leading to congestion and stranding thousands of trucks with goods. Earlier this month officials in Guangxi, an autonomous region in southern China, moved to curb rising coronavirus cases by enforcing more stringent border rules, such as extra checkpoints, mass testing and 24-hour security patrols, and suspending border gate operations and fruit imports. Those measures have disrupted supply chains in Vietnam, “adversely impacted the bilateral trade and caused great losses to businesses and people of both sides,” according to the state-run Vietnam News Agency. Vietnamese and Chinese trade officials held talks online and by phone to address the congestion late last month, V.N.A. reported. Vietnamese officials suggested “restoring customs clearance at the border gates and increasing the time for customs clearance,” the agency reported. Guangxi officials said they would ease customs clearance and convey other proposals to more senior officials, according to local news outlets. Fruit exports from Thailand to China — such as durians and longans — have also been held up by the tightened controls at Guangxi, Thai officials said in a statement on Sunday. After urgent talks with Thai officials, the Chinese authorities agreed to open another land checkpoint, the Pingxiang railway crossing in Guangxi, to allow Thai fruit into the country starting Tuesday, according to the Thai Office of Agricultural Affairs at Guangzhou. Drivers, cars and goods must be free of contamination or the Chinese authorities will immediately close the checkpoint again, Thai officials said. More than two million tons of Thai fruit worth $4.4 billion were exported to China from January to October 2021. As a surge of coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant takes a growing toll on live performance, the Public Theater announced recently that it would cancel its Under the Radar festival, originally scheduled to begin on Jan. 12. In a statement, the theater cited “multiple disruptions related to the rapid community spread of the Omicron variant,” including effects on staff availability, cancellations by artists and audience members, flight interruptions and visa processing delays. Mark Russell, the festival’s director, said in a video interview that his team had worked on plans to streamline Under the Radar — the Public’s annual showcase for experimental work, and one of several New York festivals that have formed around the Association of Performing Arts Professionals conference — so that it could proceed despite the surge. But on Thursday morning, Russell said, he took stock of the test positivity rate and number of cases in New York, and decided it would be irresponsible to press on. “It was not a time for a festival,” he said. “A festival is a celebration. It’s supposed to be a coming together to celebrate this work, and it was not going to be a celebration.” New York City is doubling the capacity of its free quarantine hotel program for people with the coronavirus, the agency that runs the program said Monday, after complaints from people who said their attempts to get a room through a city hotline met with endless waits on hold and delays of days for the rooms themselves. A spokesman for the city’s Test and Trace Corps, which runs the quarantine program, said in an email Monday, “We will have nearly a thousand beds available this week, and will continue to scale as needed.” The city has also been dealing with problems in a separate quarantine hotel program for people in homeless shelters after 11 women with the coronavirus were crammed into one room with just a few mattresses on the floor and some chairs. As the number of new virus cases in the city has skyrocketed, the spokesman, Adam Shrier, said that demand for the hotels had “quickly increased due to the rapidly transmissible Omicron variant.” He said that program had “several hundred beds available,” even as “our work force is suffering the same kind of illness and exposure as our other colleagues on the frontlines.” But he declined to say whether there was a wait for rooms, citing agency policy not to “disclose information about our locations or guests to protect their confidentiality.” Nearly 30,000 people have stayed in hotels since the program started in June 2020. The city calls it “the only free, major hotel isolation program in the country.” But four people who tried to take advantage of the main hotel-quarantine system told The New York Times late last week that they had either waited days before getting a room, given up and paid for one themselves, or been stuck on hold for hours on a city hotline without anyone ever picking up. Others posted on Twitter about long waits. Brittny Gaston of Brooklyn, 26, a medical assistant, said that five days after she requested a hotel room and was not given one, she finally spoke to someone, only to be told that she no longer qualified for the program because she no longer needed to quarantine, even though she still had Covid-19 symptoms and two people in her household had underlying health issues. “I really wanted to cry on the phone,” she said, adding that when she had Covid last February, she was able to get a quarantine hotel room without delay. Inside a homeless shelter in Brooklyn last week, meanwhile, 11 women who had tested positive for the virus were crowded into a small room, two of the women said.  One of the women, Anna Ortiz, who has chronic asthma, heart problems and uses a walker, said she had to sleep on an uncarpeted floor without a blanket or pillow. “I felt like I was being treated like an animal,” said Ms. Ortiz, 51. The city Department of Homeless Services described that situation as an “isolated incident” caused by the nonprofit that operates the shelter, Camba. Isaac McGinn, a spokesman for the Department of Homeless Services, said that Camba staff had not followed proper procedure and that the city had “conveyed to providers and staff the proper process for connecting clients who need it to isolation services to prevent this from happening.” He said that the system had abut 160 vacant beds in isolation units for people who are infected and another 210 beds in quarantine rooms for people who were exposed. A 54-year-old public-school science teacher on Long Island was arrested on New Year’s Eve after being accused of giving a teenager an injection of what appeared to be Covid-19 vaccine without his parents’ consent, the Nassau County police said. The police said that the teacher, Laura Parker Russo, administered a shot of what appeared to be a coronavirus vaccine to 17-year-old boy in her house in Sea Cliff, N.Y. The youth later went home and told his mother, who called the police and said she had not authorized the vaccination. Ms. Russo was charged with unauthorized practice of a profession, the police said. She has been removed from her classroom in the Herricks Public Schools system in New Hyde Park and reassigned pending the outcome of the investigation, schools officials said in a statement. A school website, which has been taken down, said Ms. Russo teaches at Herricks High School. Ms. Russo did not respond immediately to an email sent by The New York Times. She was released after her arrest and is scheduled to appear in criminal court on Jan. 21, the police said. Unauthorized practice of a profession is a felony under the state education law that carries a penalty of up to four years in prison. The majority of states, including New York, require parental consent for minors to receive Covid vaccinations. Some parents have prevented their children from getting inoculated for various reasons, including concerns about possible side effects and safety. Scientists say the vaccines are known to be safe for children 5 and older, and they urge vaccinating them because children can both spread the virus to others and become seriously ill themselves. The spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant has led to an increase in pediatric hospitalizations. And because broad immunity cannot be reached unless minors are vaccinated, federal and state officials hope that more parents will vaccinate their children, especially as many students return to school. Daily reports of new coronavirus cases have quadrupled in Nassau County over the past two weeks, according to The New York Times’s tracker. Hospitalizations in the county have risen 47 percent in that time. Seventy-six percent of Nassau County residents are vaccinated, according to The Times’s tracker, and the rate for 12- to 17-year-olds is only slightly lower, at 72 percent, according to state data. There is no statewide Covid vaccine mandate for schoolchildren in New York. But some private schools require vaccination, and New York City requires it for certain sports and extracurricular activities. In September, Los Angeles became the first school district to mandate vaccines for children 12 and older, with a deadline of Jan. 10, but those plans have since been delayed. The Washington, D.C., Council has voted to mandate vaccines for students 16 and older starting March 1. “This is a major source of tension between what is important for public health and what is important in terms of individual liberties and parental autonomy,” said Denis Nash, an epidemiologist at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. Schools require other vaccines for enrollment, like vaccination against measles. “That’s the big question: Does Covid-19 fall into the same category as some of these other vaccine preventable diseases that we do require for school entry, or does it not?” Dr. Nash said. The Biden administration has largely responded to the near vertical rise in coronavirus cases by pushing for more people to get not only their initial doses of vaccine, but booster shots as well. This week, federal health officials endorsed boosters for youths 12 to 17 who had initially gotten the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The government also changed the definition of “up to date” Covid vaccination to include boosters. But even as the United States has moved rapidly to expand who is eligible for boosters, progress in persuading Covid-fatigued Americans to get them has stalled. About 62 percent of Americans — about 206 million people — are fully vaccinated, according to federal data. But according to a C.D.C. database, only about 35 percent of Americans have received a booster since mid-August, when additional shots were first authorized, even as eligibility has greatly expanded. On Nov. 19, the F.D.A. authorized boosters for everyone 18 and older who had received two doses of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, and on Dec. 9, it authorized boosters of the Pfizer vaccine for 16- and 17-year-olds. Those changes led to more Americans getting boosters, according to the federal database, but that has since leveled off. After the discovery of the Omicron variant in late November, the pace of all vaccinations sped up, but it peaked in early December, and then it plateaued. (Reporting lags around the Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s holidays have affected the daily numbers throughout this period.) Omicron, which is highly transmissible, has shown that it is better at evading vaccines than other variants. But scientists say booster shots can offer substantial protection, especially against severe disease. The United States is averaging a staggering 585,000 cases a day, a record and a 247 percent increase from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are rising more slowly, up 53 percent in the past two weeks, and a smaller percentage of patients are landing in intensive care units or requiring mechanical ventilation, compared with those in previous waves. Deaths are down by 3 percent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention went even further in encouraging booster shots on Wednesday, when health officials recommended that to remain up to date, people should get three doses of Pfizer’s or Moderna’s vaccines. The agency also recommended that recipients of Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose vaccine receive a second dose, preferably of Moderna’s or Pfizer’s. “There really isn’t debate here in what people should do,” the C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, said in an interview on Tuesday. “If they’re eligible for a boost, they should get boosted.” Still, the expansion of booster shot eligibility has not been met with an equal amount of demand. Dr. Rebekah E. Gee, the former health secretary of Louisiana, chalked up the resistance to boosters to pandemic fatigue. Referring to the pandemic’s many problems, Dr. Gee said some people simply “don’t want this to be there” and are trying to “will it out of existence.”"

He was admitted to Vila Nova Star hospital, where he was undergoing exams under the care of Dr. Antônio Luiz Macedo, the surgeon who treated Mr. Bolsonaro after he was stabbed in 2018 while campaigning for president. Mr. Bolsonaro is in stable condition, the hospital said, adding that five doctors were overseeing his care. In a post on Twitter, Mr. Bolsonaro said he “started feeling poorly after lunch on Sunday.” After arriving at the hospital at 3 a.m., he wrote, he was administered a nasogastric tube, which can be used to drain fluid from the stomach of a patient with an intestinal obstruction. The president, who included a photo from the hospital in the tweet, said that more exams would be conducted to determine whether surgery was necessary. He added that the symptoms were the same ones that led to a brief hospitalization in July and cited his stabbing in 2018 as the underlying cause of his health problems. The injuries he sustained in that attack required at least four surgeries. The stabbing severely injured Mr. Bolsonaro’s intestines and led to a lengthy hospitalization that effectively knocked him off the campaign trail in the final stretch. Mr. Bolsonaro nonetheless pulled off a decisive victory. The president has suggested — without evidence — that political rivals masterminded the attack. A judge in 2019 found that the assailant was mentally ill and as such could not be convicted of a crime. The judge ordered that the assailant, Adélio Bispo de Oliveira, be held at a mental health ward in the prison system until public safety officials determined he no longer posed a threat. The president was last hospitalized in July after experiencing a bout of hiccups that lasted several days and caused stomach pain. Dr. Macedo, who was on vacation in the Bahamas, was to fly to Brazil on Monday to see the president, and Mr. Bolsonaro said on Twitter that he would arrive at 3 p.m. The doctor told the news site UOL that it was too early to tell whether the president’s condition was serious. He said he could be experiencing an intestinal obstruction for something as common as not chewing his food properly. On Monday evening, the hospital issued a statement saying that Mr. Bolsonaro’s condition was improving and that he had taken a brief walk in a hallway, according to wire reports.

He was 77. President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya announced the death in a statement but did not specify a cause. Mr. Leakey died at his home outside Nairobi, said Prof. Lawrence Martin, director of the Turkana Basin Institute at Stony Brook University on Long Island; Mr. Leakey was its founder. Mr. Leakey’s parents, Louis and Mary Leakey, were towering figures in paleontology, but Richard was initially determined to steer clear of his parents’ field, finding work instead as a safari guide, before eventually, and perhaps inevitably, succumbing to fossil fever. A turning point came on a flight in 1967, when he looked down over the rocky shores of Lake Turkana in Kenya and had, by his account, a feeling that the area could yield a trove of fossils. He was right. The fossils found there by Mr. Leakey and his “Hominid Gang,” as he and his colleagues came to be known, would change the world’s understanding of human evolution. One of his most celebrated finds came in 1984 when he helped unearth “Turkana Boy,” a 1.6-million-year-old skeleton of a young male Homo erectus. The other was a skull called “1470,” found in 1972, that extended the world’s knowledge of the Homo erectus species several million years deeper into the past. “He was a mentor to dozens of Africans in diverse fields and had played a key role in shaping the world’s view on Africa’s place in the human evolution story,” WildlifeDirect, the organization he founded, said in a statement on Sunday. But Mr. Leakey was important for more than finding fossils, said Prof. John Hawks, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; he was also credited with “creating an entire scientific, interdisciplinary infrastructure that enabled discoveries” and established a new model for scientific research, Professor Hawks said. Mr. Leakey’s discoveries landed him on the cover of Time magazine in 1977. He starred in a 1981 BBC program, “The Making of Mankind,” which was also the title of one of his many books. He parlayed his fossil hunter fame into a public-minded career. Among his roles were Kenya’s head of public service, the director of the National Museums of Kenya and the chairman of the board of the Kenya Wildlife Service, Mr. Kenyatta said in his statement. “He had equally impactful careers in so many different areas,” Professor Martin said, adding that Mr. Leakey “has probably been responsible for producing close to half of the world’s evidence for human evolution.” Mr. Leakey was a passionate conservationist with a fiery personality. In 1989, he drew international attention when he took a stand against the illegal ivory trade by helping to burn the country’s stockpile of 12 tons of ivory, confiscated from smugglers and poachers. The act was repeated in 2016. His fossil discoveries were almost as remarkable as his ability to evade death. He fractured his skull as a boy, almost died after receiving a kidney transplant from his brother Philip in 1979, lost both legs in a 1993 plane crash and was once treated for skin cancer. Richard Erskine Frere Leakey was born in Nairobi on Dec. 19, 1944, the second of Louis and Mary’s three sons. “I would never describe it as a close family,” he once said. Anthropology always took precedence over a conventional family life, he recalled. Though early on he was determined not to be an anthropologist, the field found him anyway. Heir to what has been called Leakey’s Luck, he found fossil after fossil as a child, including the jaw of an extinct pig, he said in an interview with Stony Brook University. “I was angry to this day that they took the bone away from me because it was too important for a 4-year-old to be digging up,” he said. After he decided to pursue fossil hunting, he sought a degree in anthropology in London but ran out of money before starting classes. He returned to Kenya to pursue the field firsthand, having already gained more experience in the field while growing up than many graduate anthropologists. As a famous fossil hunter Mr. Leakey eventually returned to academia as a sought-after lecturer. He had never been to a university, he liked to say, except to lecture. His marriage to Margaret Cropper ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Meave Leakey, herself a renowned paleoanthropologist; their daughters, Louise and Samira; a daughter, Anna, from his previous marriage; and three grandchildren. Mr. Leakey believed strongly in a message his father had written long ago, that the past was the “key to our future.” For him, paleoanthropology and conservation were “deeply entwined,” said Paige Madison, a paleoanthropology historian based in Copenhagen. Toward the end of his life, Mr. Leakey dreamed of building a museum of humankind, to be called Ngaren. It would be situated in the Rift Valley of Kenya, the site of one of his most famous discoveries, the Turkana Boy. “Ngaren is not just another museum, but a call to action,” Mr. Leakey said in a 2019 statement announcing its opening, scheduled for 2024. “As we peer back through the fossil record, through layer upon layer of long extinct species, many of which thrived far longer than the human species is ever likely to do, we are reminded of our mortality as a species.”"

Another man who was also in the vehicle was hospitalized in critical condition after the crash, the police said. The storm dropped more than 14 inches of snow in parts of Northern Virginia, while Washington recorded more than eight inches, according to the Weather Service. In central Tennessee and northern Alabama, which caught the tail end of the storm, snowfall totals reached nine inches, the Weather Service said.  The storm was moving north on Monday afternoon through Maryland, Northern Delaware and Southern New Jersey, where snowfalls totals ranged from six to 15 inches. The weather system was expected to pull offshore by about 10 p.m., Andrew Orrison, a meteorologist with the Weather Service in College Park, Md., said. In North Carolina, the storm brought strong winds and snow to the mountains in the western part of the state, while up to two inches of rain fell in Greensboro, Raleigh and Durham, breaking daily records for rainfall set in 1992. As of Monday night, more than 340,000 customers in Virginia were without electricity, while outages affected 43,000 customers in North Carolina and more than 42,000 in Maryland, according to PowerOutage.us, which aggregates data from utilities across the United States. Hundreds of flights from Washington-area airports were canceled or delayed on Monday morning, according to FlightAware, which tracks the status of flights. The Atlantic City International Airport temporarily closed on Monday while crews worked to clear runways of snow, according to the New Jersey Department of Transportation. At a news conference on Monday, Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington said, “I can’t emphasize enough right now that you should stay home.” A snow emergency was in effect for the city until 7 p.m. Monday. Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland mobilized state resources, and Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey declared a state of emergency for five counties, warning residents to stay off the roads. In Delaware, state government offices were closed. At a news conference, Governor Murphy said that as of Monday afternoon, emergency workers in his state had assisted 245 motorists.  “Stay off the roads,” he said. “Let this thing get cleaned up over the course of the evening, and then hopefully get a fresh start commute in the morning.” Roads in the region became treacherous. The Virginia State Police said on Monday that its officers had responded to more than 650 reports of crashes and assisted more than 600 stranded vehicles as of 4 p.m. Some drivers had minor injuries, but no deaths were reported, the authorities said. “The cars are going too fast for conditions, and they’re sliding off the roads, into ditches, into the cement walls, into one another,” said Corinne Geller, a spokeswoman for the Virginia State Police. Rain on Sunday prevented crews from properly salting the roads, she said, making highways more dangerous during the snow on Monday. In Washington, Ms. Bowser said on Monday that residents should stay off the “very slick and hard-to-pass” roads. Crews were working to remove snow from the roads in the affected states on Monday afternoon, after the worst of the storm had passed. Several agencies posted images of cars stuck on snow-covered roads, which officials urged residents to avoid so snow plows could clear the streets. “Stay off the roadways, so our crews can safely do their jobs,” the Maryland Department of Transportation said. Schools across the Washington region canceled classes on Monday, as did several in the Richmond area in Virginia. In New Jersey, some systems announced closures while others said they would operate with delayed openings. The heaviest snow, at two inches per hour, occurred right after the transition from rain on Monday morning, meteorologists said. Mr. Orrison of the Weather Service said that there were reports of thundersnow — a phenomenon when thunder and lighting occur during a snowstorm — in the Washington area on Monday.  The possible refreezing of melted snow in the evening and overnight hours could lead to additional travel concerns. With the possibility of black ice and slick roadways, the Virginia Department of Transportation told residents on Monday night to avoid travel, and the Maryland Department of Transportation told drivers to delay their commutes on Tuesday morning.  “The refreeze on the road could definitely be dangerous for commuters on Tuesday morning,” Mr. Orrison said."

She was on her bed, scrolling through social media while her boyfriend was downstairs playing a game on his Xbox. Then, the bed shook. “The sensation,” Ms. Ishler, 34, later said, “reminded me of fireworks” and how, if you stand too close, you can feel “a rumbling in your chest.” She looked out her bedroom window. It was gray — a little rainy, but calm. Her boyfriend said that he, too, had felt something, as did a neighbor in their building. “It was just the feeling of the shock wave,” Ms. Ishler recalled, “but no sound or flash or anything like that.” Diane Turnshek, an astronomer who lectures at Carnegie Mellon University, felt something powerful on Saturday morning, too. She was in her home atop a Pittsburgh hill, 1,120 feet above sea level. Her initial thought was that her dryer had fallen off the washing machine in the room next door. Calls started coming into the Pittsburgh office of the National Weather Service from people who had heard “a really loud sound but didn’t see anything,” said Jenna Lake, a Weather Service meteorologist. Soon, it seemed as if everyone was looking for answers. (Ms. Lake’s curiosity was more professional than personal. She was in the office that morning but did not feel or hear anything. Ms. Lake chalks that up to the fact that the office has “pretty sturdy windows,” and also possibly that “our cleaning staff was here and maybe a vacuum was on.”) No earthquakes were detected by the seismograph at the nearby Allegheny Observatory, Ms. Turnshek said. Seismographs are sensitive enough to detect earthquakes, but they are not calibrated to detect surface vibrations that rattle homes or windows. Ms. Lake at the Weather Service said the air over Pittsburgh on Saturday was “too benign” for storms or lightning, so those were ruled out, too. Airplanes were quickly discounted, Ms. Lake said, because they do not move as fast as meteors that break pressure barriers, and “we don’t typically hear them when they’re all the way up,” flying at high altitude. “Our guess was potentially a meteor,” Ms. Lake said. It is the “only thing besides aircraft incidents that would have been known occurrences and could have caused that type of sound.” Chris Leonardi, also a Weather Service meteorologist based in Pittsburgh, said the thinking was that a meteor either “exploded or vaporized.” One of their colleagues used a device called a Geostationary Lightning Mapper, which, according to NASA, “can detect the momentary changes in an optical scene, indicating the presence of lightning.” Since there were no storms in the area, meteorologists believe the source of the vibration was “a meteor moving toward Earth pretty low in the atmosphere, relatively close,” Ms. Lake said. Just after 4 p.m. on Saturday, the Weather Service announced its conclusion on Twitter: “The loud explosion heard over SW PA earlier,” it said, “may have been a meteor explosion.” After the Weather Service announcement, people took to social media to share their accounts and theories about what had happened. Some posted videos on Twitter that they said captured the “boom.” One person posted a video of a backyard pond on Facebook in which fish can be seen almost jumping, as if they had been startled. “No discernible sound,” the person wrote, “but something spooked them.” It was not the first time in recent memory that people have wondered about seemingly mysterious activities overhead. In December 2018, the sky over New York City erupted in a blue light. People theorized about a U.F.O. flyby or an alien invasion, though the cause turned out to be a transformer explosion at a Con Edison substation. In 2015, a 500-pound meteor streaked through the sky above western Pennsylvania triggering a sonic boom, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. More recently, in October, a boom shook homes in New Hampshire, giving rise to theories that an earthquake or an aircraft was to blame. (Satellite imagery, however, suggested a meteor exploded in the atmosphere above the state.) In Pittsburgh on Saturday, Ms. Lake said that nobody reported seeing anything “below the cloud deck,” which was about 2,000 feet above the ground. Ms. Lake thinks the meteor could have been “a couple of thousand feet” above the ground, but not below the cloud cover. For now, a meteor explosion is the best theory about what happened over Pittsburgh on Saturday, Ms. Lake said, though it will remain just that — a theory — “unless someone finds some rocks in their backyard,” she said. Ms. Turnshek, the Carnegie Mellon lecturer, said that what she and others in Pittsburgh experienced on New Year’s Day was “rare and notable,” a “once-in-a-lifetime event.” Despite the rarity, there is no shortage of movies depicting the dangers of a meteor, asteroid or comet crashing to Earth (including “The Day the Sky Exploded,” “Meteor,” “Armageddon” and the recent “Don’t Look Up”). Astronomers are on the lookout for such things, Ms. Turnshek said. “If we had found a large body incoming,” the best solution would probably be to “send a rocket to sit next to it, and the gravitational pull of the rocket will pull it off course.” Back in Dormont, Ms. Ishler shared the Weather Service’s conclusions with her friends and neighbors, mostly out of delight. The year, she said, had started off “with a bang.”"

With its vast stretches of emerald grass dotted with hay bales and ringed with blue-tinged peaks, and the wild horses and cattle that roam there, it looks less like a shuttered strip mine and more like an ad for organic milk. The mountain is poised for another transformation. Hundreds of acres are set to be blanketed with solar panels in the coming year, installed by locals, many of them former miners. The $231 million project, which recently cleared its last regulatory hurdle, may well be the biggest utility-scale coal to solar project in the country. It would be a desperately needed economic boost drenched in symbolism: Renewable energy generated from a shuttered mine in the heart of Appalachia, where poverty grinds on in the aftermath of the coal industry’s demise. In many ways, the project is a test case for whether a region once completely dependent on digging fossil fuels from the ground can be revived by creating clean energy from the sun. As coal continues to decline — the number of jobs nationwide fell to about 40,000 last year from 175,000 in the mid 1980s — supporting former coal communities is seen as vital for what has been termed a “just transition,” in part to ward off backlash against attempts to decarbonize. Yet even as coal miners elsewhere resist the prospect of work in solar and wind production, Martin County’s bleak economic picture — its unemployment rate is nearly twice the national average — has opened many residents to investment of pretty much any sort. Coal mining has already flatlined here; by last count the county had just 26 miners left, down from a peak of thousands. “The global warming thing, I think a lot of that is overplayed,” said James Mollette, a 65-year-old former miner, as he whiled away part of a recent afternoon inside Miss Ida’s Tea Room in downtown Inez, the county seat. But Mr. Mollette said he was all for a new solar farm, even if it offered largely temporary work. “Anything we can get will be a plus to the economy,” he said. Martin County is in the eastern part of the state sandwiched between West Virginia and Johnson County, Ky., home to the world famous coal miner’s daughters, the singers Loretta Lynn, and her sister, Crystal Gayle. (A $5 ticket buys entry into the ramshackle cabin in Butcher Holler where they and their six siblings grew up.) In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson flew to Martin County to tout his war on poverty, posing before cameras on the porch of an unemployed saw mill operator and father of eight. Nearly six decades later, suffering continues. About one third of the dwindling population lives in poverty, battered by the sharp drop in coal production as well as the environmental damage left in mining’s wake. Over the past decade, the coal severance tax revenue collected by Martin County based on how much coal is pulled out of the ground has fallen more than 90 percent to $80,000 in the last fiscal year, according to Colby Kirk, the county’s deputy executive judge. As mining work plummeted, people moved elsewhere. Those who stayed face hourslong commutes to manufacturing, retail and service jobs in other counties and states. The region is so job-starved that when a massive indoor tomato farm opened up earlier this year three counties away, some 7,000 applications flooded in for 350 spots. The area also withstood an enormous coal slurry spill in 2000 when a containment lagoon burst into an abandoned mine below it, sending more than 250 million gallons of toxic coal waste laced with arsenic and mercury into local waterways. The spill, more than 20 times bigger than the Exxon Valdez oil disaster, oozed into yards and streams for miles, suffocating every frog, fish and snapping turtle in its path and contaminating the county’s drinking water. Yet part of the legacy of the Martiki mine — flat sprawling spaces, proximity to power transmission lines, not to mention a population hungry for work —- may have paved the way for a more auspicious future. “Our bet is we can help make this community, and others like it in coal country, relevant to the opportunities in the green energy economy that everyone agrees is coming,” said Adam Edelen, a Kentucky native and former Democratic state auditor who is the local developer for the project. Mr. Edelen said the fact that a promised return of coal had failed to materialize helped his cause. “I would’ve been run out of the coalfields had I tried to do this six to 10 years ago,” he said. For more than a decade, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been recommending that renewable energy projects be built on Superfund sites, former landfills and abandoned mines — property less desirable for housing or other uses. Of the roughly 130,000 potential sites it has identified, fewer than 500 have been developed for renewable energy projects, the agency said. Still, there is growing interest among green energy developers. Of the 18 other solar projects planned by Mr. Edelen’s company, Edelen Renewables, one third would be built on former mines. “It’s a great opportunity to address climate needs in ways that reduce environmental and social impacts, and that’s why we’re looking at this hard,” said Nels Johnson, the North America director of renewable energy for the nonprofit the Nature Conservancy, which itself is in the early stages of helping to develop solar farms atop former mines in eight states, including on its own land in West Virginia. “Renewable energy in those settings can bring new life to these lands.” Getting to the old Martiki site requires winding through valleys and hollers, past bungalows, shacks, kudzu-choked ditches, rusted-out cars, tiny Baptist churches, roadside burial plots and a community called Pigeon Roost. Up at the now-flattened summit, the sky yawns big and wide. After shutting down most operations in the 1990s, the mine’s owners oversaw what Mr. Edelen said was an admirable job restoring the land. People have been racing all terrain vehicles on the grounds, and it has become home to a band of horses, many set free by residents who could no longer afford to tend to them. Until recently, a farmer grazed some cattle there, too. Once the solar project gets underway, the animals are expected to move to adjacent land. As many as 300 workers will be needed to install the panels, which will stretch over about 1,200 acres of fenced land. Mr. Edelen, whose company has trademarked the phrase “social impact solar,” said the jobs will pay an average of $25 to $30 an hour; according to the United Mine Workers of America, union miners in the region average $31.40 an hour. All but about a dozen of the solar jobs will be temporary, lasting between 12 to 18 months. Mr. Edelen, and developers at Savion, the company that owns the Martin County solar project, have worked with administrators at nearby Big Sandy Community College to create a certificate program so their workers might be hired elsewhere. “Selfishly, we have other projects in the region, other developers do too, and these skills are going to be transferable,” said Erich Miarka, a director of development of Savion. “There’s going to be a lot of work over the next several years.” With solar now the fastest growing source of new electricity in the United States, developers have been looking to central Appalachia, drawn by its energy infrastructure and position within the country’s biggest electricity marketplace, which makes it easier for developers to sell their energy to the grid. A crucial lure for the Martin County project is a sizable regional power substation up on the mountain. The solar farm would generate up to 200 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 33,000 homes, which can be fed to a substation to be carried via still-robust transmission lines, avoiding what could have amounted to multimillion dollars in upgrades. Around Martin County, eagerness for new investment is tempered by some trepidation. Nina McCoy, a local activist and retired biology teacher, said she felt the public had been shut out of much of the planning process, and lamented that the energy generated wouldn’t directly help the county, where residents face skyrocketing utility bills. “I worry that it’s going to be another extractive industry,” she said. There are also competing opinions about how much the community will benefit. Savion has committed to pay Martin County up to $300,000 each year for 30 years in lieu of taxes. (According to Mr. Edelen the project received federal tax credits but hasn’t gotten state or federal investment.) Victor Slone, the county judge-executive, said the amount was “significant,” but Lisa Stayton, publisher of the local paper, the Mountain Citizen, said that considering inflation, it wasn’t that much. “​​People here, for the most part, are glad to see any kind of business come,” Ms. Stayton wrote in a text message. “That says we are still as desperate as we ever were.” Down the mountain, in the village of Lovely, interviews with former coal miners on a recent day also yielded differing views. Two ex-miners who were working at a small liquidation shop said that they were anti-solar, and wanted the coal industry to come back. Asked what they’d have liked to see go atop the old Martiki mine, one suggested a track for drag racing. But at a dusty intersection a few hundred feet away, another former miner, Gary Webb, 66, said he was “all for that solar farm.” Mr. Webb was spending the day tearing a wood porch off a decrepit mobile home, along with his cousins, Ernie Dials, 74, also a retired miner, and Darrell Davis, who is in his sixties. They said they bought the home for $1,500, and planned to rebuild the porch at Mr. Davis’ house.  Mr. Webb said he welcomed almost any sort of development up on the mountain, and that all the coal had been mined out of it anyway. “Coal mining’s not coming back, and if it’s just 15 to 20 full time jobs, it’s better than nothing, and better than the land sitting there and doing nothing ,” he said, as roosters crowed nearby.

WASHINGTON — The anniversary of the Jan. 6 riot arrives this week with the congressional committee investigating the attack confronting a series of difficult questions, including how forcefully to flex its subpoena power and whether the Supreme Court will stymie a major element of its inquiry. As the nine-member panel continues to examine the events leading up to the worst attack on Congress in centuries, it is waiting to see whether the Supreme Court will refuse a request from former President Donald J. Trump to block the committee’s access to White House records related to the riot. The committee also has not ruled out moving to subpoena members of Congress, or Mr. Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence. Thursday will mark a year since a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building, determined to disrupt the formal certification of President Biden’s electoral victory. At least seven people died in connection with the riot, dozens more were injured and hundreds of workers in the Capitol were shaken and traumatized, further fracturing an increasingly partisan Congress. The committee, aiming to release a final report before the November midterm elections, is planning for a more public stage of its investigation in the coming weeks as lawmakers work to trace the planning of the attack and expand the scope of the investigation. Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and a member of the panel, said on Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that public hearings could begin “in a matter of weeks, if not a couple of months from now.” But as the inquiry continues, the first anniversary will draw even more attention as lawmakers, staff members, Capitol employees and journalists commemorate the day. Both Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are scheduled to give speeches marking the anniversary. While the House is not scheduled to return for legislative work until Jan. 10, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has mapped out events for lawmakers to participate in on Thursday, either in Washington or virtually from their districts, in what she described as “an observance of reflection, remembrance and recommitment.” The House will hold a moment of silence before Dr. Carla Hayden, the librarian of Congress, moderates a discussion with historians “to establish and preserve the narrative of Jan. 6,” Ms. Pelosi wrote in a letter to her caucus. Lawmakers will give speeches reflecting on the day, and lawmakers will hold an early evening prayer vigil on the center steps of the Capitol. Unlike the House, the Senate is scheduled to be in session this week as Democrats continue confirming Biden administration nominees and seek to revive their party’s stalled legislative agenda. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, is expected to invoke the riot and efforts by Trump loyalists to overturn the 2020 election as he pushes to pass a voting rights overhaul and try to change Senate rules to overcome a Republican filibuster against that legislation. The Senate Rules Committee will hold an oversight hearing with J. Thomas Manger, the Capitol Police chief, on Wednesday. On Thursday, however, it is likely that some senators may be in Atlanta to attend an afternoon memorial service for former Senator Johnny Isakson, a Georgia Republican who died in December. Some lawmakers have questioned whether it was appropriate for Congress to be in session, given the lingering trauma from the day. “It was a sad day in our nation’s history, and a terrible day, and I don’t think bringing a lot of attention to the day is a great idea,” said Senator Susan Collins of Maine, one of seven Republicans who voted to convict Mr. Trump after he was impeached for his role in inciting the mob that day. “For some of the staffers,” she added, “for some of the Capitol Police officers, it brings back a lot of trauma, and I just think it’d be better if we aren’t here.” A majority of Republicans, however, have sought to downplay the attack. They have largely refused to acknowledge their party’s complicity in failing to quash Mr. Trump’s lies about the election and cut ties with the former president, who continues to peddle conspiracy theories rather than accept his electoral loss. “Our party has to choose,” Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the vice chairwoman of the Jan. 6 committee and one of two Republican panel members, said Sunday on “Face the Nation.” “We can either be loyal to Donald Trump or we can be loyal to the Constitution, but we cannot be both. And right now there are far too many Republicans who are trying to enable the former president.” Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, emphasized his party’s opposition to the riot in a letter to House Republicans, although he did not mention the former President. “As we have said from the start, the actions of that day were lawless and as wrong as wrong can be,” he wrote. “Our Capitol should never be compromised and those who broke the law deserve to face legal repercussions and full accountability.” But he rebuked Democrats, accusing them of “using it as a partisan political weapon to further divide our country.” In a series of separate televised appearances on Sunday, Ms. Cheney and Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the committee’s chairman, pointedly did not rule out making criminal referrals to the Justice Department. “If we find something that is irregular or illegal, we’re obligated to report it,” Mr. Thompson said. Appearing on ABC’s “This Week,” he said that while the committee had already asked two sitting Republicans, Representatives Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Jim Jordan of Ohio, for testimony, more interview requests were possible. “What people saw on Jan. 6 with their own eyes was not just something created at one moment,” Mr. Thompson said. “It was clearly, what we believe, based on the information we have been able to gather, a coordinated activity on the part of a lot of people.” Ms. Cheney, appearing later on the same show, said the committee had received firsthand testimony that Mr. Trump was watching the attack unfold in the dining room next to the Oval Office as members of his staff pleaded for him to go on television and call for his supporters to leave. According to the testimony, Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and adviser, went into the room twice to ask her father to intervene, Ms. Cheney said. “I think that there are a number of — as the chairman said — potential criminal statutes at issue here, but I think that there’s absolutely no question that it was a dereliction of duty,” Ms. Cheney said. “And I think one of the things the committee needs to look at, as we’re looking at a legislative purpose, is whether we need enhanced penalties for that kind of dereliction of duty.” The committee has obtained more than 35,000 documents so far, including a trove released on New Year’s Eve by Bernard Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner who was involved in Rudolph W. Giuliani’s effort to investigate claims of voter fraud. Among the documents Mr. Kerik turned over to the committee is a 22-page “Strategic Communications Plan” to overturn Mr. Biden’s victory and install Mr. Trump for a second term. “We Have 10 Days To Execute This Plan & Certify President Trump!” the document stated. “GOAL: Nationwide communications outreach campaign to educate the public on the fraud numbers, and inspire citizens to call upon legislators and Members of Congress to disregard the fraudulent vote count and certify the duly-elected President Trump.” Mr. Kerik said he had withheld from the committee a Dec. 17, 2020, document called “Draft Letter From POTUS to Seize Evidence in the Interest of National Security for the 2020 Elections.” The document was created around the time some of Mr. Trump’s advisers, including the former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn, were discussing seizing voting machines and invoking national security emergency powers after the election."

Venetians made sure to walk on the narrow stone strip at the center, some lifting fogged glasses to keep their eyes on the ground. When a visitor tripped, they barely lifted their gaze. “That is not a bridge,” said Angelo Xalle, 71, a retired port worker, who recalled helping people with broken chins or foreheads get up from its sleek floor. “It’s a trap.” The bridge, Ponte della Costituzione, by the star architect Santiago Calatrava, is a multimillion-dollar work of glass and steel that opened in 2008. Its smooth curve above the Grand Canal, near Venice’s train station, was meant to symbolize the city’s embrace of modernity, but it has become better known as a stage for ruinous tumbles and dangerous slips. Now, after years of protests and problems, the city has decided to replace the translucent glass with less slippery — and less glamorous — trachyte stone. “People hurt themselves, and they sue the administration,” said Francesca Zaccariotto, Venice’s public works official. “We have to intervene.” The city’s decision to allocate 500,000 euros, or about $565,000, to replace the bridge’s glass section comes after several failed attempts to limit slips with resin and nonslip stickers. Last month, as the winter cold and rains made the floor especially dangerous, officials placed keep-off signs on the glass portion of the bridge, which is most of it. Acclaimed around the world for work including the World Trade Center Transportation Hub in New York, Mr. Calatrava was commissioned to design the bridge in 1999. When it opened nine years later, after protests about delays and soaring costs, complaints about falls began quickly. Protests intensified in 2013, when the city installed a cable car on the bridge to make it more accessible. The red, round cabin — not designed by Mr. Calatrava — cost about €1.5 million, was slow to cross the bridge and became unbearably hot in the summer. It was later dismantled. In 2018, the city replaced some of the slabs of glass with trachyte, but during the pandemic, when national television filmed people walking over the bridge to illustrate the return to normalcy after a lockdown, it inevitably caught someone slipping. This past year, the administration gathered the funds to fully replace the glass. Venice is not the first city to experience problems with Mr. Calatrava’s projects. In 2011, Bilbao, Spain, laid a huge black rubber carpet over a Calatrava footbridge paved with glass tiles because so many pedestrians had slipped and fallen. While Venice’s plan still needs to undergo structural tests and be approved by the city’s architectural authority, city officials are determined to proceed to prevent the “almost daily” falls, Ms. Zaccariotto said. While she appreciated Mr. Calatrava’s work, she said that aesthetic criteria should not outweigh safety principles and that because the lawsuits were addressed to the city and not to the architect, Venice was going to handle the situation. “We can’t always do poetry,” she said. “We must give security.” Mr. Calatrava has faced lawsuits and fines for troubles relating to the bridge, but has defended himself against detractors. “The bridge was checked with sophisticated methods,” he said in 2008, “which determined that it has a solid structure which is behaving better than expected.” Mr. Calatrava’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the new safety plan or criticisms about the footbridge. One of the claimants, Mariarosaria Colucci, a retired Roman teacher, was headed to the theater to watch her son perform in 2011 when she broke her humerus — “in five parts like an artichoke” — by falling on the Calatrava bridge. She sued the city and was initially awarded compensation of about €80,000, but she lost in the appeal and is awaiting a decision by Italy’s Supreme Court. “That bridge is beautiful for an architecture magazine,” said Ms. Colucci, 76, “but you must be good not to fall.” Anna Maria Stevanato, who took a bus to the city for a burraco tournament that year, broke her shoulder on the bridge. “I fell like a bag of potatoes,” she said, adding that Mr. Calatrava “ruined the most beautiful years of my old age.” To Ms. Stevanato, 80, the problem stems from the fact that Mr. Calatrava, who is Spanish-born, has not mastered the art of building safe bridges like locals. Venice has some 400 bridges, and Ms. Stevanato and many Venetians pride themselves on being able to cross them while reading books, or with their eyes closed. On the Calatrava bridge, though, Venetians say the mixed dimensions of the steps and the color of the tiles leave them confused and their feet adrift. “A Venetian would have never built such nonsense,” Ms. Stevanato said. Some welcomed the new change to the footbridge. “It’s going to be uglier,” said Leonardo Pilat, 19, whose mother fell on the bridge, “but it’s necessary.” Not everyone agreed. “It’s an exceptional bridge, and they should keep it like this,” said Demetrio Corazza, 85, a retired professor who frequently crossed the bridge with his wife to go grocery shopping. “Beauty must save the world.”"

At times, it was overwhelming. Two new rovers landed on Mars, one of them shadowed by an experimental helicopter. Two billionaires launched themselves to the edge of space, and a third billionaire flew himself higher up into orbit. Then William Shatner flew to space, and a fourth billionaire enjoyed a stay aboard the International Space Station. It didn’t end there. China started building a fully operational space station, but relied on a large rocket that reached orbit and then could not be controlled when part of it re-entered the atmosphere. Aboard the International Space Station, a pair of mishaps sent the outpost into unplanned flips in orbit. NASA said goodbye to one asteroid and headed back to Earth carrying samples of it. But NASA also launched a new mission to crash into another asteroid to study defending humanity from a future space-rock strike. Much more happened throughout the year, and 2022 is looking just as busy. You can keep track of these and more big moments by subscribing to The Times Space and Astronomy Calendar at this link. Here’s what may happen in spaceflight in 2022. Sometime this coming year, two rockets that have never been to space — the NASA Space Launch System and the SpaceX Starship — are expected to lift off. They’re both very big and about as different as two rockets can be. The Space Launch System, or S.L.S., is NASA’s interplanetary launch vehicle. It is years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. Built by traditional aerospace contractors, each launch costs about $2 billion and each rocket can be used only once. NASA says its Artemis program can’t get astronauts back to the moon without the giant rocket. Its first test flight, with no people aboard, will lift a capsule called Orion around the moon and back to Earth. The launch, known as Artemis 1, is scheduled for March or April. Starship, by contrast, is being built by SpaceX alone. The fully reusable rocket is central to the vision of Elon Musk, the company’s founder, for sending humans to Mars. A version of Starship is also planned for landing NASA’s astronauts on the lunar surface. The silvery spacecraft’s top half has completed multiple high-altitude test flights that ended in spectacular explosions. It completed a successful landing in one test. Sometime during the year, a Starship prototype with no crew aboard is set to pair with a large reusable booster stage. When the rocket lifts off from a SpaceX launch site in Texas, it will then head to orbit before splashing down off the coast of a Hawaiian island. If 2021 was the year of missions to Mars, the next year could be dominated by trips to the moon. As many as nine missions from an assortment of countries and private companies could try to orbit or land on the moon. Five are sponsored by NASA, and some have clearer prospects of occurring on time than others. In addition to the Orion capsule circling the moon and heading back to Earth, a CubeSat, a miniature satellite, called CAPSTONE could be lifted by Rocket Lab from its New Zealand launch site in March. It would study a lunar orbit that could be used by a future NASA and European moon base. Three more missions headed toward the lunar surface are the work of private companies sponsored under NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. That effort aims to repeat NASA’s success of relying on companies like SpaceX to carry cargo, and later astronauts, to the International Space Station. Intuitive Machines, a Houston company, may be the first company to attempt the trip. The rest of the moon’s robotic visitors in 2022 come from other countries. India may try to redo its unsuccessful 2019 lunar landing in the summer. And Russia says it aims to land on the moon for the first time since 1976. A South Korean moon orbiter could lift off on a SpaceX rocket as soon as August. And a Japanese company, ispace, is working on a landing craft for carrying a variety of cargo, including a rover from the United Arab Emirates, to the moon’s surface. Which of these missions sticks to its schedule is up in the very thin lunar air. Lately, China has kept its word when it says its space program will achieve a certain timeline. So if it says it will finish building the Tiangong space station in orbit in 2022, there’s a good chance that it will. In 2021, China added its Tianhe space module to low-earth orbit and sent two different crews of astronauts to live there. The second crew will come home sometime in 2022, and perhaps by the middle of the year, a laboratory module, Wentian, may launch to orbit and dock with the Tianhe module. Later in the year, a third piece, the Mengtian lab, could complete the Tiangong space station. Both Wentian and Mengtian would launch atop China’s largest rocket, the Long March 5B. Last May, that rocket startled many people when it began an out of control re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere, raising the unlikely but not impossible prospect of causing damage and injury when it landed. Even though the rocket splashed down without incident in the Indian Ocean, it remains unclear whether China will change how it is managed. That means twice more in 2022, Earthlings could play the game of “where will it come down?” NASA has studied numerous asteroids up close, but now it plans to deliberately crash into one. In September, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test is expected to slam into Dimorphos, a small rock that orbits a bigger asteroid, Didymos. Colliding with an asteroid is a potential tactic for planetary defense — if a giant space rock is heading toward Earth, some scientists say that humanity’s best bet is to divert its path so it misses our world. The DART mission would provide data on the effectiveness of this approach. Other asteroids beckon. Psyche, a large object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, appears to be made mostly of iron and other metals. That suggests that in the early history of the solar system, Psyche was the core of an object that failed to form into a planet. A NASA science mission named after the object is planned for launch in the summertime atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. Scheduled for arrival in 2026, the spacecraft would provide scientists their first up-close look at this strange metallic world. "

Here are 10 findings to remember next time you head to the supermarket or to the kitchen. In October, the American Heart Association released new dietary guidelines to improve the hearts and health of Americans of all ages and life circumstances. Instead of issuing a laundry list of “thou shalt not eats,” the committee focused on how people could make lifelong changes, taking into account each individual’s likes and dislikes as well as ethnic and cultural practices and life circumstances. “For example, rather than urging people to skip pasta because it’s a refined carbohydrate, a more effective message might be to tell people to eat it the traditional Italian way, as a small first-course portion,” Jane Brody explained. As people grappled with higher levels of stress, depression and anxiety during the pandemic, many turned to their favorite comfort foods: ice cream, pastries, pizza, hamburgers. But studies in an emerging field of research known as nutritional psychiatry, which looks at the relationship between diet and mental wellness, suggest that the sugar-laden and high-fat foods we often crave when we are stressed or depressed, as comforting as they may seem, are the least likely to benefit our mental health. Whole foods such as vegetables, fruit, fish, eggs, nuts and seeds, beans and legumes and fermented foods like yogurt may be a better bet. “The idea that eating certain foods could promote brain health, much the way it can promote heart health, might seem like common sense,” Anahad O’Connor wrote in his story on the research. “But historically, nutrition research has focused largely on how the foods we eat affect our physical health, rather than our mental health.” Coffee is beloved by many, but its health benefits have often been called into question. The latest assessments this year of the health effects of coffee and caffeine, however, were reassuring. Their consumption has been linked to a reduced risk of all kinds of ailments, including Parkinson’s disease, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, gallstones, depression, suicide, cirrhosis, liver cancer, melanoma and prostate cancer. Scientists know that the trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in our guts play an important role in health, influencing our risk of developing obesity, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and a wide range of other conditions. In 2021, a large international study found that the composition of these microorganisms, collectively known as our microbiomes, is largely shaped by what we eat. Researchers learned that a diet rich in nutrient-dense, whole foods supported the growth of beneficial microbes that promoted good health. Eating a diet full of highly processed foods with added sugars, salt and other additives had the opposite effect, promoting gut microbes that were linked to worse cardiovascular and metabolic health. Potato chips, ice cream, pizza and more unhealthy foods continue to dominate the American diet, despite being linked to obesity, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and other health problems. “They are cheap and convenient, and engineered to taste good. They are aggressively marketed by the food industry,” Mr. O’Connor reported in a story about new research on whether these foods are not just tempting, but addictive. The notion has sparked controversy among researchers, he said. One study found that certain foods were especially likely to elicit “addictive-like” eating behaviors, such as intense cravings, a loss of control, and an inability to cut back despite experiencing harmful consequences and a strong desire to stop eating them. But other experts pointed out that these foods do not cause an altered state of mind, a hallmark of addictive substances. Unsweetened carbonated water is a better choice than soda or fruit juice, Christina Caron reported, but it probably shouldn’t be your main source of water. Seltzer has the potential to be erosive to your teeth, experts told her, and carbonated beverages can contribute to gas and bloating, Ms. Caron wrote. Unique factors like body size, outdoor temperature and how hard you’re breathing and sweating will determine how much water you need, an expert told Christie Aschwanden for her story on what it really means to “stay hydrated.” “For most young, healthy people, the best way to stay hydrated is simply to drink when you’re thirsty,” she learned. “Those who are older, in their 70s and 80s, may need to pay more attention to getting sufficient fluids because the thirst sensation can decrease with age.” Yogurt, kimchi and kombucha have long been dietary staples in many parts of the world. But this year, as Mr. O’Connor reported, scientists discovered that these fermented foods may alter the makeup of the trillions of bacteria, viruses and fungi that inhabit our intestinal tracts, collectively known as the gut microbiome. They may also lead to lower levels of body-wide inflammation, which scientists increasingly link to a range of diseases tied to aging. Acid reflux is among the most frequent health complaints of American adults, and may have become even more common in the wake of pandemic-related stress and weight gain. Jane Brody covered new research that showed that those who adhered to five key lifestyle characteristics — including exercise and following a Mediterranean-style diet, featuring fruits and vegetables, fish, poultry and whole grains — were more likely to ward off discomfort from the most persistent and potentially serious form of reflux. A study first published in July found that flavonoids, the chemicals that give plant foods their bright colors, may help curb the frustrating forgetfulness and mild confusion that older people often complain about with advancing age. Further follow-up would be needed to determine whether foods might affect the risk of developing dementia, and there are also broader policy issues at play, making it difficult for everyone to access fresh fruits and vegetables, Nicholas Bakalar reported. But, experts agreed these are foods you should be eating for brain health. "

What the man doesn’t know is that the interior of his down jacket has suffered a structural failure, and the filling has massed along the bottom hem, forming a conspicuous bulge at his waist. As they greet each other, the woman perceives the bulge and asks herself: Is my date wearing a colostomy bag? They sit down to eat, but the woman is distracted. As they chat about their lives — former spouses, work, interests — the woman has “colostomy bag” on her mind. Is it or isn’t it? The two academics are of an age where such an intervention is, well, not exactly common, but not out of the realm of possibility. At the end of their dinner, the man takes the train back to Philadelphia, where he lives, and the woman returns to her apartment on the Upper West Side. Despite the enigma of the man’s midsection, the date is a success."

The government was set to overhaul its law governing women’s rights for the first time in decades, to refine the definition of sexual harassment, affirm prohibitions on workplace discrimination and ban forms of emotional abuse. For many women in China, the response was: Hm, really? The proposed revisions are the latest in a series of conflicting messages by the Chinese government about the country’s growing feminist movement. On paper, the changes, which China’s legislature reviewed for the first time last month, would seem to be a triumph for activists who have long worked to push gender equality into the Chinese mainstream. The Women’s Rights and Interests Protection Law has been substantially revised only once, in 2005, since it was enacted nearly three decades ago. The government has also recently emphasized its dedication to women’s employment rights, especially as it urges women to have more children amid a looming demographic crisis. The official newspaper of China’s Supreme Court explicitly tied the new three-child policy to the revision, which would codify prohibitions on employers’ asking women about their marital status or plans to have children. At the same time, the authorities, ever leery of grass-roots organizing, have detained outspoken feminist activists and sought to control the country’s fledgling #MeToo movement. Sexual harassment lawsuits — already rare — have been dismissed. Women have been fired or fined for lodging accusations. When Peng Shuai, a star tennis player, recently said on social media that a top Chinese leader had pressured her into sex, she was censored within minutes, and many worry that she is under surveillance. Women have also been increasingly pushed out of the workplace and into traditional gender roles since China’s leader, Xi Jinping, assumed power. Some fear that the campaign to encourage childbirth could turn coercive. The contradictions were clear in a recent article in the Global Times, a Communist Party-owned tabloid, about Chinese feminist advocacy. While the article hailed the proposed legal revisions as a “landmark move,” it also denounced “spooky ‘feminism’” and derided the “so-called MeToo movement” as yet another Western cudgel against China.  Feminist activists have warned against giving the revisions too much weight. Feng Yuan, the founder of Equality, a Beijing-based advocacy group, welcomed the move for its potential to impose “moral responsibility and pressure” on institutions. But she noted that the draft does not specify clear punishments for the violations it outlines. Instead, it uses phrases such as “will be ordered to make corrections” or “may be criticized and educated.” “This law, to be honest, is more of a gesture than a specific plan of operation,” Ms. Feng said. The gesture, at least, is extensive. As revised, the law would offer the most comprehensive legal definition yet of sexual harassment, to include behaviors such as sending unwanted sexually explicit images or pressuring someone into a relationship in exchange for benefits. It also instructs schools and employers to introduce anti-harassment training and channels for complaints. The law would also codify women’s right to ask for compensation for housework during divorce proceedings — following the first-of-its-kind decision by a Chinese divorce court last year to award a woman more than $7,700 for her labor during her marriage. Some provisions would go beyond those in other countries. In particular, the draft bans the use of “superstition” or other “emotional control” against women. While the draft does not offer further details, state media reports have said those bans would cover pickup artistry. Pickup artistry — a practice that arrived in China from the United States — commonly refers to the use of manipulative techniques, including gaslighting, to demean women and lure them into having sex. It became a booming industry in China, with thousands of companies and websites promising to teach techniques, and it has been widely condemned by both the government and social media users. Elsewhere, bans on emotional coercion are spotty. Britain banned it in 2015, while the United States has no federal law against it. Yet the truly novel aspects of the Chinese law are limited. Many of the provisions already exist in other laws or regulations but have been poorly enforced. China’s labor law bans discrimination based on sex. The compensation-for-housework measure was included in a new civil code that went into effect last year. While the law affirms women’s right to sue, its emphasis is largely on authorizing government officials to take top-down action against offenders, said Darius Longarino, a researcher at Yale Law School who studies China. “The priority should be on bottom-up enforcement, where you empower individuals who have been harassed to use the law to protect their rights,” he said. It is rare for victims of harassment to go to court. An analysis by Mr. Longarino and others found that 93 percent of sexual harassment cases decided in China between 2018 and 2020 were brought not by the alleged victim but by the alleged harasser, claiming defamation or wrongful termination. Women who have made public harassment claims have been forced to pay those they accused. Nonlegal complaints can bring heavy consequences, too. In December, Alibaba, the e-commerce giant, fired a woman who had accused a superior of raping her. The company said that she had “spread falsehoods,” even though it had earlier fired the man she accused. Even when women do sue their harassers, they face steep hurdles. Perhaps the most high-profile #MeToo case to go to court was brought by Zhou Xiaoxuan, a former intern at China’s state broadcaster, who asserted that Zhu Jun, a star anchor, had forcibly kissed and groped her. But the case faced years of delays. In September, a court dismissed the claim and said she had not provided enough evidence, though Ms. Zhou said the judges had rejected her efforts to introduce more. In an interview, Ms. Zhou expressed skepticism that the revised law would change much. “The judicial environment won’t be changed by one or two legal amendments,” she said. “It will take every court, every judge really understanding the plight of those who suffer from sexual harassment. This is probably still a very long, hard road.” Emotional control could prove even harder to substantiate, especially in a country where open discussion of mental health can still carry a stigma. Guo Jing, a feminist activist from Wuhan, noted that psychologists are rarely admitted as expert witnesses in Chinese courts, and that judges might be skeptical of claims of depression or other mental health conditions. And patriarchal attitudes still remain deeply entrenched. After the draft revisions were published, several male bloggers with large followings on the social media platform Weibo denounced the provisions against degrading or harassing women online, saying they would give “radical” feminists too much power to silence their critics. Still, some women remain optimistic about the possible power of the proposed changes. A woman in southern Guangdong Province who asked to use only her last name, Han, out of fears for her safety, said that she had endured years of physical and emotional abuse by her ex-husband. Even though she managed to secure a divorce last year, he continues to stalk and threaten her, she said. She obtained a restraining order, viewed by The New York Times, that cited chat logs and recordings. Yet even with the restraining order, when Ms. Han called the police, they often told her that threats alone were not enough for them to take action, as he had not physically harmed her, she said. If the law is revised, she continued, the police will be forced to recognize that she has a right to seek their help. “If the law changes, I will be even more convinced that everything I’m doing right now is right,” she said."

For decades, Mr. Javier and his family have seen the tribe in northern Washington State as their people, their home. But they are now among more than 300 people who are being disowned by the tribe, on the losing end of a bitter disenrollment battle that has torn apart families and left dozens of people facing eviction in the middle of the coldest Washington winter in years. In recent days, the tribe has mobilized its police force to begin removing Mr. Javier, who lives with his three children, and others from their tribal homes, after having already cut off educational aid, health services, financial stipends — and whatever remained of what was once an expansive sense of community. “The main thing is identity,” Mr. Javier said last week in the stove-heated living room of the three-bedroom tribal home he has lived in since 2010, a traditional cedar-woven hat hanging from the wall beside him. “Your whole life you think you are Nooksack, and then, bam, they are saying you are not Nooksack.” In an Indigenous community that has always championed Native Americans’ sovereign rights and independence from federal oversight, the outcast Nooksack members are so outraged that they are petitioning the federal government to intervene. The Biden administration, which made a commitment to honoring tribal self-determination, now faces thorny questions over whether it should take the extraordinary step of challenging tribal sovereignty on an issue so fundamental as how the tribe chooses who gets to live on tribal lands. “On the face of it, for sure we want sovereignty,” said Michelle Roberts, another expelled Nooksack member who faces eviction. “But when that sovereignty is used as a tool to bully people and take advantage of the system, to kick them out of their tribe or to take any kind of services or anything away from them, then that’s when it needs to be controlled somehow.” A tribe of about 2,000 people, the Nooksack fought for decades, starting in the 1800s, for federal recognition and rights to the territory that they had long inhabited. The tribe now has trust land and a small reservation, bringing in revenue from a casino, a convenience store and a gas station. Tribal members have treaty rights to fish salmon along the namesake river that flows out of the Cascade Mountains. Tribes around the country have moved in recent years to trim their membership rolls, scrutinizing family trees and cutting out those deemed to have tenuous or insufficient ties to tribal heritage in an effort to strengthen tribal identity. The disenrollment fights have escalated as casinos and other businesses have brought in new revenue, development, growth and job opportunities. For the Nooksack, whose casino has not been a big money earner, the 306 members who have been purged say their family group was singled out for disenrollment by rivals who, the outcasts say, wanted to maintain tribal leadership and access to the lucrative tribal jobs that come with a grip on power. Opposing groups in the tribe have long feuded over those issues as control has swung from side to side. Nooksack leaders have said the expelled people are descended from a tribal band based in Canada and should never have been enrolled. None of them had direct ancestors who were included in a crucial tribal census that was undertaken in 1942, and Ross Cline, the tribal chairman, who has led the eviction effort, said the tribal leadership’s responsibility now was to preserve the tribe’s land and resources for qualifying members. “If your neighbor picks up the fence and moves it 10 feet onto your property, do you say that’s cool, or do you put up a fight about it?” he said. The battle comes amid an affordable housing crisis across the West. With evictions targeting 21 homes that house 63 people, those facing removal — some of them 80 and older — say they do not know where they will go, especially now, with Washington State paralyzed with unusual instances of snow and cold weather. The federal government, which funds tribal housing programs, asked the tribe last month to halt the evictions for 30 days in order to give the government time to review the situation. “There are extremely concerning allegations of potential Civil Rights Act and Indian Civil Rights Act violations regarding these evictions,” Darryl LaCounte, the director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, wrote in a letter to Mr. Cline. But Mr. Cline said he had no interest in waiting, saying the request would merely delay the process of making tribal homes available for those who were actually enrolled. “Last summer they would have said it was too hot to move,” Mr. Cline said. “Just before Easter, they would say it’s not a good time to move. Or July 4th. Pick any day close to some holiday or bad weather.” Mr. Cline said the federal government was preparing to take on a fight that should rightly be a matter for the tribe to decide without outside interference. “A very old term for B.I.A. is ‘Boss Indians Around,’” Mr. Cline said. “They have been doing that throughout the entire history of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.” Tribal enrollment disputes have previously escalated into national debates. In 2007, the Cherokee Nation voted to strip tribal citizenship rights from the descendants of Black people who had been enslaved by the tribes because they did not meet “blood” requirements established under the tribe’s constitution. A court ruling later found that the so-called Cherokee Freedmen should have all the rights of tribal citizens under an 1866 treaty that granted citizenship to Cherokee slaves, and the tribe’s Supreme Court last year effectively altered the tribe’s Constitution to grant rights to the descendants. But courts have largely prioritized tribal sovereignty. A landmark 1978 Supreme Court ruling blocked a lawsuit that challenged a discriminatory law adopted by the Santa Clara Pueblo in New Mexico, with justices writing that settling such disputes in federal court “would be at odds with the Congressional goal of protecting tribal self‐government.” In an email to federal officials last month, Mr. Cline cited that ruling. “I am concerned about potential B.I.A. involvement in Nooksack governmental affairs,” he wrote to the bureau’s regional director, Bryan Mercier. The bureau declined to elaborate on the letter it had sent seeking the 30-day delay on the Nooksack eviction issue. The question of the family group singled out for disenrollment goes back to a woman named Annie George, who grew up in the Matsqui area of British Columbia, where the dispersed Nooksack tribe had one of its villages, her descendants say. Two of Ms. George’s daughters moved to the Nooksack tribal area in Washington State in the 1980s and enrolled as members. Those who have been disenrolled and who are now targeted for eviction are members of that extended family. The George descendants were hardly on the periphery of the tribe; over the years, the family members gained political power, including positions on the tribal council. In 2000, their rivals accused them of commandeering control of the tribe and smuggling drugs from nearby British Columbia. They appealed to the federal government to intervene, and several of the extended George family members, including Mr. Javier, were subsequently indicted on federal drug charges. Power shifted again in an election about a decade ago. The 306 disenrolled members believe the effort to oust them is an extension of this long-simmering rivalry. Gabe Galanda, a lawyer representing the disenrolled members and a member of the Round Valley Indian Tribes of California, said the case had raised questions about due process, legal representation and civil rights. The affected families do not have lawyers to represent them in tribal court, he said, because the tribe has barred him and other legal representatives from appearing on their behalf. Mr. Galanda said the request for federal intervention in the Nooksack case was not an attack on sovereignty but a recognition of the government’s moral obligation to prevent abuses of tribal leadership, through withholding of federal financial benefits if necessary. The stakes are particularly high with the current threats of eviction because some of the people facing the loss of their homes have lease-to-own agreements under which they have built years of equity, Mr. Galanda said, although Mr. Cline disputes the terms. Mr. Cline said such properties were intended to benefit only legitimate tribal members. Those now targeted for eviction have long been on notice, he said. “These people knew four years ago that this was happening,” Mr. Cline said. “They chose to ignore it or hoped it would go away.” Mr. Cline said the eviction process was scheduled to proceed within days for six families; more than a dozen other families will be removed later, he said. Mr. Javier is first in line. He has been trying to find an apartment where he might be able to move if the eviction takes place, as the tribal leadership vows it will, possibly next week. The county, where Bellingham is the largest city, has experienced a dramatic increase in housing costs in recent years. Older residents facing eviction fear they will have trouble finding places that they can afford on fixed incomes. From his front yard, Mr. Javier noted the location of Mr. Cline’s home just a few doors down the street. “The hardest thing for me is growing up with all these people, you know what I mean?” he said. “Just to watch them turn from friends to the people that just ignore me. It’s just heartbreaking.” "

Include your name and location, or a request to remain anonymous. Letters may be edited. I am afraid of dogs. When I was 5, a German Shepherd bit me and that was that for me and dogs. Over the years, I never cared for them, though I certainly never begrudged anyone who loved them. Last year, I got my wife a puppy, which is to say I got us a puppy, and now I love our dog. He is perfect. I love hanging out with him — he is sweet and smart and funny. But I would never bring him into a professional situation unless it was necessary and I had explicit endorsement from anyone who would be affected. Dog lovers are, I’ve learned over the years, an intense and passionate breed. And some dog lovers want to believe it is appropriate to bring dogs everywhere. I am not here to debate that. In a workplace that isn’t explicitly dog-friendly, there are some boundary issues that need to be worked out. It sounds like you have been really tolerant and fair up until now. These things can be such a slippery slope. What starts out as a generous accommodation for one person can quickly become an out of control situation. Even though your colleagues won’t like it, you should either compel your boss to establish a dog policy or you should do it yourself because it sounds like he has implicitly granted you the authority to do so. Think about what a workable solution could look like — only allowing dogs in cases of emergency, for example, or two dog-friendly days a week. This is a sticky situation but I firmly believe you can find a way forward that will be better than what you’re presently dealing with. It is well past time to meet with human resources. Illness is not indicative of weakness or professional incompetence. I’m pretty sure ending up in a coma was far worse timing for you than your manager, who is shockingly callous. I feel naïve saying that. But my goodness, what happened to empathy? The animosity seems intensely personal and wildly inappropriate. Unfortunately, the federal government enacted few workplace protections for people who contracted Covid. Common sense and decency dictate you shouldn’t be punished for getting so sick. And it’s disgraceful that you have little recourse. In California, though, it is against the law for an employer to retaliate for someone using sick leave. If you haven’t already, document every instance of your manager using your illness against you. Talk to human resources to see how they plan to address this and if they don’t rise to the occasion, it may be time to seek the counsel of an employment lawyer. I’m sorry you’ve had such a rough go of it and hope your situation improves, and quickly. We are in a pandemic. Nothing is normal, and employers have to recognize that their employees are human beings in human bodies. The polite response: “I invite you to stop commenting on my appearance immediately. It’s none of your concern and has nothing to do with our work together.” The less polite response is to repeat what they said right back to them but turned up a notch. For example, if they remark that you look tired, tell them they look haggard. They’ll get the message, eventually. I drive with a heavy foot but driving at more than 90 m.p.h.? That’s a bit much. Sometimes you have to tell a colleague a difficult truth. You can’t control how your co-worker receives your feedback. I would tactfully tell her that her driving makes you feel unsafe. Note that you would prefer her to drive closer to the speed limit and device-free. She can be sensitive about her driving but she doesn’t have the right to jeopardize your life or the lives of those with whom she shares roadways."

Over the past year, working from anonymous DNA samples, Moore helped identify the suspect in a murder by tracking old migration patterns from Poland to northern New Jersey; solved an assault case in which female DNA at the crime scene turned out to have been left not by the usual sort of explicable coincidence but by an actual female perpetrator; and made a key discovery in a murder investigation when the gravestone of an apparently childless woman was found to bear the inscription “MOTHER.” Some of these she knocked out in a few frenzied days. But there was also one cold case that had dogged her for close to two and a half years: the murder, in Gresham, Ore., of a woman named Barbara Tucker.  Moore is perhaps the most prominent figure in the field of genetic genealogy — the mapping and measuring of how relatives share DNA — which was developed in the aughts as a result of direct-to-consumer genomic testing. One application of genetic genealogy, it quickly became clear, was to determine someone’s identity through a broader web of genetic relationships, and Moore rose to prominence solving maternity-ward mix-ups, helping adoptees and foundlings locate birth parents and identifying unknown fathers.

On Sunday, the wireless companies responded and said no. In a letter sent on Friday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Steve Dickson, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, asked the two wireless companies to delay their planned introduction, on Wednesday, of new 5G technology for a “short period” of up to two weeks. Failing to reach a deal “will force the U.S. aviation sector to take steps to protect the safety of the traveling public,” the officials wrote. “These steps will result in widespread and unacceptable disruption as airplanes divert to other cities or flights are canceled, causing ripple effects throughout the U.S. air transportation system.” On Sunday, AT&T and Verizon said they intended to proceed with their 5G expansion. The aviation industry had nearly two years to upgrade any equipment that might be affected by the new spectrum use, the companies said. “Our two companies are deeply committed to public safety and national security, and fortunately, the question of whether 5G operations can safely coexist with aviation has long been settled,” John Stankey, the chief executive of AT&T, and Hans Vestberg, Verizon’s chief executive, wrote in a joint letter. The fight could add to the turmoil that has been plaguing airlines and their passengers in the past week, as carriers battled bad winter weather and a coronavirus wave that thinned their staffing during a peak holiday travel period. The wireless carriers previously agreed to a 30-day delay of their scheduled December debut of the 5G expansion. Federal officials said they wanted the additional delay to give them time to identify critical airports in need of a buffer zone to temporarily protect their operations. Verizon and AT&T offered an alternate compromise: For six months, until early July, the companies said they would comply with a version of restrictions now in place in France, which would sharply limit the signals at issue around busy airport runways. The 5G expansion is a major priority for the wireless carriers. Verizon and A&T collectively paid more than $70 billion last year at a government auction for access to the so-called C-band spectrum, which will bring their networks greater geographic reach and faster signals. The carriers have not yet said which areas will get the new services this week, or how many customers they will cover, but Verizon said last month that it expected its new spectrum to reach 100 million customers by March. AT&T has said it plans to reach at least 70 million people in the United States by the end of this year. The showdown is also to some degree a fight between government regulators. The Federal Communications Commission has urged wireless carriers to expand their 5G networks, while the Federal Aviation Administration has sought to slow things down in response to airlines’ concerns. On Saturday, Brendan Carr, a Republican F.C.C. commissioner appointed by President Donald J. Trump, tweeted about a letter he sent that day to Mr. Buttigieg criticizing the agency’s objections. “Your request for the delay is not backed up by the science, engineering or law,” Mr. Carr wrote. A spokeswoman for the F.A.A. said in a written statement that the agency was reviewing the wireless carriers’ letter. “U.S. aviation safety standards will guide our next actions,” she said."

It remained difficult to purchase new consoles like the Xbox Series X, the Nintendo Switch OLED and the PlayStation 5. (One fine day, we’ll play Deathloop.) Cloud gaming continued to grow in importance and Roblox continued to dominate. And, as a result of lawsuits or employee unrest, game industry giants like Activision and Riot Games were forced to confront their terrible records on sexual harassment and gender discrimination. While the real world continued to oscillate between open and closed, video games remained a constant for some of us here at The Times. Below, a sampling of the titles that meant the most to us in 2021. New Pokemon Snap is probably not what you think it is. There’s no catching vibrant monsters or sending them into battle. Instead, you’re on a mission to take the highest-quality photos possible of rare Pokemon as you travel along a set course through forests and seafloors. It’s a serene, meticulous game that rewards perfectionism and involves coaxing the wild creatures into picture-perfect poses by offering fruit, playing music and illuminating their silhouettes as night falls. This was the title I anticipated the most in 2021. I played the original version of the game, released in 1999, for countless hours on the Nintendo 64, snapping hundreds of photos of Charmanders crowding around apples and discovering how to convince Jigglypuff to sing or Pikachu to surf. I affectionately refer to the summer of 2001 as the summer of 64, as in Nintendo 64. For those three months, my college friends and I largely avoided the steamy Kentucky days in favor of a dimly lit off-campus apartment where we spent most of our waking hours playing Mario Golf. We had our own language for every play: “Nestle!” being our favorite, for a ball that’s rolling a little too fast on the green. And when I closed my eyes at night, I’d see those rippling grids guiding me to the pin. When Mario Golf: Super Rush was released on the Switch this summer (exactly 20 years later), I was transported back, a welcome anchor to less chaotic times. Thankfully, my wife also loves the game and doesn’t get too irritated as I repeatedly implore the ball to “nestle.” Most surprising was my muscle memory which, despite the decades, was as keen as ever. I’m pretty sure you still couldn’t beat me. Escape From Tarkov has ruined all other video games for me. It’s so hard, so punishing and comes with such a steep learning curve that once it clicks, other shooting games just don’t cut it anymore. It’s all I play now. Like Call of Duty or Counterstrike, the game is a first-person shooter focused on player-versus-player combat while completing a difficult series of tasks across a half-dozen maps. Set in the fictional region of Tarkov in a not-too-distant future Russia, the game posits a single question: How would you, a paramilitary contractor, survive in a war-ravaged failed state? The answer is by shooting practically everyone you see while scavenging any materials you can find amid the wreckage. It is not for everyone. Because Tarkov gives you zero help — no in-game maps, hundreds of different types of items and complicated gun customization options — it’s up to you to scour the many third-party sites devoted to helping people understand the game. Every time you are killed, you lose every item you were carrying into the raid. And you will die. Like, a lot. Technically, Escape From Tarkov is still in development and calls itself a “Beta,” but anyone with a PC can purchase it and play. Do so at your own risk. The recent retro-gaming boom owes a real debt to Metroid, since so many of these new titles, built to resemble ’80s and ’90s video games, were directly influenced by the iconic action-adventure series. So why did it take Nintendo so long to revisit this space and show everybody how it’s really done? Metroid Dread is the first 2-D adventure in the series in almost two decades, and it’s a blast to play, especially when you’re sending Samus Aran into battle with hunter robots that follow her from room to room. Better yet, in an era where too many games are drowning in dialogue, Metroid Dread parcels out just enough story to keep you hooked and lets your imagination run wild from there. (The ending made me yelp!) The best moments of Persona 4 Golden take place outside of combat. They happen when you cook dinner with your little cousin, go to the movies with your friends or even just study for a big exam. Much of the game’s long run time is spent going through the everyday minutiae of high school life, but it always feels special because even the smallest interactions strengthen your bond with others. The power of friendship is a common theme throughout the series, but this entry hit especially hard because I finished it around the first anniversary of the pandemic. I cherished the memories I made with my virtual friends because I knew what I was missing in real life. Persona 4 Golden is now a major talking point in a few of those relationships. I’m the target audience for Halo Infinite, released 20 years after the franchise’s debut normalized hauling a television and Xbox into a friend’s basement for night-devouring battles. Halo Infinite’s multiplayer maps are exquisitely designed, with intertwined pathways and sight lines that reward teamwork. The starting weapon arsenal is potent, and success requires coordinating to acquire (or evade) the rocket launcher, gravity hammer or overshield. But thrilling gameplay is not enough for some. Halo Infinite generates revenue by selling cosmetic upgrades, and a vocal contingent has complained about the pace of progression to unlock a new helmet. I’m old and I don’t care what my avatar looks like. You won’t see it anyway: I’m sneaking in with active camo, then filling an unsuspecting enemy with pink needles before grabbing the flag. In 2021, I became fascinated by FromSoftware’s notoriously difficult games like Demon’s Souls and Bloodborne. Dealing with their simulated bleakness was a surprisingly comforting way to cope with the harsh reality of living through a pandemic. I think Dark Souls III, released in 2016, is the studio’s most polished game. It reuses the best elements of its previous action RPGs to create a compilation of what makes them most engaging — excellent art direction as well as innovative level and narrative design. Unlike many other games in the genre, its storytelling is not done through long exposition, but through information that is included on every item and with every short interaction. There were a few constant companions in a terrible year: my wife, my child, my dog, my house. Slay the Spire was another. I had runs that were on a knife’s edge and took hours to complete. I had runs where I made absurd choices in the hopes they would work out. I had runs where I optimized my chance of winning and runs where I made decisions just to spite my least favorite foe, the shelled parasite. I played on the highest difficulty and mostly lost (which made the wins extremely satisfying) and crushed the lowest difficulty. I had hundreds (thousands?) of runs in 2021. They all ruled. The Resident Evil franchise turned 25 in 2021, and with more than two dozen entries in the series, the best of the bunch is still 2005’s Resident Evil 4. What made RE4 special was its replay value; after beating it, you could start over and keep your items, making you more powerful with each playthrough. Because of this, I’ve played and replayed RE4 more times than I’d like to admit. Resident Evil Village, released in May, scratches that same itch. When you first enter the village and meet its sizable cast of deranged, seemingly invincible villains, it plays as dread-inducing survival horror. In New Game Plus, it’s a completely different experience, allowing you to take on hordes of werewolves with overpowered revolvers and machine guns (or a light saber, if you’re interested). I started the game over immediately after finishing it, and didn’t stop until I unlocked all the best gear. Playing through Village, over and over again, was the most fun I’ve had with a Resident Evil game in years. Sometimes, all you want is to escape into a superhero power fantasy where you button mash your way to victory and look cool doing it. And for all of the criticism it has received, Marvel’s Avengers delivers that experience. In yet another year where it feels like I’ve tracked the passage of time through Marvel Cinematic Universe releases, it’s been satisfying to recreate that movie choreography with a controller in hand. Plus, Crystal Dynamics, the studio behind Marvel’s Avengers, has continued to assemble a growing character roster since the game’s debut in 2020. Both Hawkeyes (Clint Barton and Kate Bishop), Black Panther and Spider-Man (for players on PlayStation consoles, at least) have joined the original cast, and with each addition there’s a new, unique set of moves to discover. The gameplay loop can become redundant after defeating thousands of enemies, but every so often a series of events will capture that cinematic quality for a moment. It’s that spark of joy that keeps me mashing away. When It Takes Two won game of the year, it was a surprise to many — a cooperative multiplayer game beating out several well-reviewed franchise titles. It Takes Two centers on a husband and wife who are magically transformed into dolls by their daughter, who is upset at them for fighting. The parents don’t want to be dolls, so they have to work together to regain human form. Part of the game’s draw is familiar for anyone who has spent the past two years seeking creative ways to maintain connections with far-flung loved ones. Games like Among Us and the Jackbox Party Pack have demonstrated that demand. For me, that desire often meets another reality: I’m terrible at first-person shooters, especially in multiplayer. It Takes Two evens up novice and experienced gamers by introducing zany abilities that generally last a short time. The mechanics keep things fresh, and because they are specific to each player they challenge teammates to constantly talk to and help each other move throughout the game. In spring 2020, when lockdown was in full effect, I introduced my now 7-year-old to video games. On the Nintendo Switch, we tore through Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Super Mario Odyssey. We worked up a sweat playing hours and hours of Just Dance. (I think I’d be fine if I never heard Panic! at the Disco’s “High Hopes” ever again.) But it was The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that obsessed us most — we both became lost in its vast open world and deep mythology. Zelda games continued to carry us through 2021. We bruised our thumbs on the fighting game Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity and hunched over on the sofa together in hand-held mode playing the adorable Link’s Awakening. But the second half of 2021 was devoted to Skyward Sword. We spent 50 or so hours flying around Skyloft and performing spin attacks on dumb Bokoblins. The game’s Timeshift Stones, which allow you to make the past present, were among the more inventive game concepts we’d seen in our almost two years of playing together."

Venetians made sure to walk on the narrow stone strip at the center, some lifting fogged glasses to keep their eyes on the ground. When a visitor tripped, they barely lifted their gaze. “That is not a bridge,” said Angelo Xalle, 71, a retired port worker, who recalled helping people with broken chins or foreheads get up from its sleek floor. “It’s a trap.” The bridge, Ponte della Costituzione, by the star architect Santiago Calatrava, is a multimillion-dollar work of glass and steel that opened in 2008. Its smooth curve above the Grand Canal, near Venice’s train station, was meant to symbolize the city’s embrace of modernity, but it has become better known as a stage for ruinous tumbles and dangerous slips. Now, after years of protests and problems, the city has decided to replace the translucent glass with less slippery — and less glamorous — trachyte stone. “People hurt themselves, and they sue the administration,” said Francesca Zaccariotto, Venice’s public works official. “We have to intervene.” The city’s decision to allocate 500,000 euros, or about $565,000, to replace the bridge’s glass section comes after several failed attempts to limit slips with resin and nonslip stickers. Last month, as the winter cold and rains made the floor especially dangerous, officials placed keep-off signs on the glass portion of the bridge, which is most of it. Acclaimed around the world for work including the World Trade Center Transportation Hub in New York, Mr. Calatrava was commissioned to design the bridge in 1999. When it opened nine years later, after protests about delays and soaring costs, complaints about falls began quickly. Protests intensified in 2013, when the city installed a cable car on the bridge to make it more accessible. The red, round cabin — not designed by Mr. Calatrava — cost about €1.5 million, was slow to cross the bridge and became unbearably hot in the summer. It was later dismantled. In 2018, the city replaced some of the slabs of glass with trachyte, but during the pandemic, when national television filmed people walking over the bridge to illustrate the return to normalcy after a lockdown, it inevitably caught someone slipping. This past year, the administration gathered the funds to fully replace the glass. Venice is not the first city to experience problems with Mr. Calatrava’s projects. In 2011, Bilbao, Spain, laid a huge black rubber carpet over a Calatrava footbridge paved with glass tiles because so many pedestrians had slipped and fallen. While Venice’s plan still needs to undergo structural tests and be approved by the city’s architectural authority, city officials are determined to proceed to prevent the “almost daily” falls, Ms. Zaccariotto said. While she appreciated Mr. Calatrava’s work, she said that aesthetic criteria should not outweigh safety principles and that because the lawsuits were addressed to the city and not to the architect, Venice was going to handle the situation. “We can’t always do poetry,” she said. “We must give security.” Mr. Calatrava has faced lawsuits and fines for troubles relating to the bridge, but has defended himself against detractors. “The bridge was checked with sophisticated methods,” he said in 2008, “which determined that it has a solid structure which is behaving better than expected.” Mr. Calatrava’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the new safety plan or criticisms about the footbridge. One of the claimants, Mariarosaria Colucci, a retired Roman teacher, was headed to the theater to watch her son perform in 2011 when she broke her humerus — “in five parts like an artichoke” — by falling on the Calatrava bridge. She sued the city and was initially awarded compensation of about €80,000, but she lost in the appeal and is awaiting a decision by Italy’s Supreme Court. “That bridge is beautiful for an architecture magazine,” said Ms. Colucci, 76, “but you must be good not to fall.” Anna Maria Stevanato, who took a bus to the city for a burraco tournament that year, broke her shoulder on the bridge. “I fell like a bag of potatoes,” she said, adding that Mr. Calatrava “ruined the most beautiful years of my old age.” To Ms. Stevanato, 80, the problem stems from the fact that Mr. Calatrava, who is Spanish-born, has not mastered the art of building safe bridges like locals. Venice has some 400 bridges, and Ms. Stevanato and many Venetians pride themselves on being able to cross them while reading books, or with their eyes closed. On the Calatrava bridge, though, Venetians say the mixed dimensions of the steps and the color of the tiles leave them confused and their feet adrift. “A Venetian would have never built such nonsense,” Ms. Stevanato said. Some welcomed the new change to the footbridge. “It’s going to be uglier,” said Leonardo Pilat, 19, whose mother fell on the bridge, “but it’s necessary.” Not everyone agreed. “It’s an exceptional bridge, and they should keep it like this,” said Demetrio Corazza, 85, a retired professor who frequently crossed the bridge with his wife to go grocery shopping. “Beauty must save the world.”"

I can’t talk. I feel in a daze. My soul is crushed.” And yet, when she looks to the future, she sees only one option. “I have high optimism,” she said. “Everyone says you can’t imagine this happening to you. But when it’s right in front of you, we’re built for this. You can only do the next thing. But first, rebuild it.” Her home is one of more than two dozen in her neighborhood in Louisville, Colo., destroyed by the devastating Marshall fire, which consumed roughly 1,000 homes in suburban neighborhoods between Denver and Boulder on Thursday. And after the flames, after charred homes were buried under snow on Saturday, people turned on Sunday to the daunting task of imagining the long road back to the life they took for granted before the fire. “Just a few days ago, you were celebrating Christmas at home, and hanging your stockings, and now home and hearth have been destroyed,” Colorado’s governor, Jared Polis, said at a news conference on Sunday. “It’s a shock.” Whole neighborhoods turned to ash, while local stores, including a Tesla dealership, were destroyed or badly damaged in what might turn out to be the most damaging wildfire in state history. At a moment’s notice, 35,000 people were forced to evacuate as nearly 1,000 homes were set ablaze. Shortly thereafter, the state received a baffling 10 inches of snow on land the wildfire had scorched. The death toll remains at zero, but two people are still missing, Sheriff Joe Pelle of Boulder County said on Sunday. The search team is now sifting through incinerated homes for any human remains. The cause of the fire remains unconfirmed. “I don’t have a definitive or final answer for you yet,” Sheriff Pelle said at a second news conference on Sunday. “And I don’t want to go down rabbit holes, as far as speculation.” Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency arrived on Sunday, while a disaster assistance center opened in the area for those returned to homes still intact but without power. Even the local post office performed a small miracle: mail delivered on a Sunday. “It’s a long road ahead,” Mr. Polis said. “We’ve built back from other disasters, and we will build back stronger from this one.” Ms. Perez and her neighbors have formed a private Facebook group to share information, and most group members are expressing their intent to rebuild, she said. But in a time of shortages of labor and resources, and in the middle of a pandemic, there are enormous financial and logistical hurdles that she, and others, now face in constructing new homes. While Ms. Perez is insured, she isn’t sure she can afford this. “I’m told it would cost $800,000 now,” she said. “My policy is not an $800,000 policy.” Garry Sanfaçon, the county’s disaster recovery manager, said that recovery from these kinds of disasters is measured not in months, but in years. The state isn’t even done, he pointed out, rebuilding from a disastrous flood that hit the area nine years ago. And while wildfires usually occur in Colorado’s mountainous region, far from where most of its residents live, the Marshall fire attacked drought-stricken suburban neighborhoods instead. Only about 100 of the nearly 1,000 homes burned by the 6,200-acre wildfire were on unincorporated land, according to Mr. Sanfaçon. The rarity of this event means recovery reliefs are entering uncharted territory. And though about 60 percent of people who live in homes damaged in mountainous areas are uninsured, according to Mr. Sanfaçon, it may be different for suburban homeowners. Officials will also need to process the exhaustive paperwork involved in rebuilding, and as people start to rebuild on their charred properties, he isn’t sure how competition for contractors and building supplies will play out. “This is not an infrastructure disaster,” he said. “This is a private property disaster.” While many of the homes destroyed by the fire were owned by people who are considered affluent, Lori Peek, a sociology professor and the director of the Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado Boulder, said there are also renters in the region. “There are people who are going to be underinsured,” she said. “We for sure know that.” As Ms. Peek points out, disasters are a shared experience, but not everyone exists on the same financial plane. “The fact of the matter is that in those disasters, inequities always emerge in terms of who is most impacted and who has the hardest time recovering from disastrous events,” Ms. Peek said. And while Ms. Perez waits to find out what rebuilding her home will look like, she continues to ride a wave of emotions that range from despair to confusion to hope. “I have to find a place to live,” she said. “And then face whatever comes next.”"

He had been at the social media giant since it acquired his start-up, CrowdTangle, in 2016. And he had watched that project, which tracks the content that draws attention on Facebook, emerge as perhaps the single most important window into what was actually happening on the megaplatform. But his project had increasingly become an irritant to his bosses, as it revealed the extent to which Facebook users engaged with hyperpartisan right-wing politics and misleading health information. While Mr. Silverman no longer works at Facebook, he hasn’t quite left the company behind. Instead, he has spent the weeks since his exit working with a bipartisan group of U.S. senators on legislation that would, among other things, force the giant social media platforms to provide the sort of transparency that got him marginalized at Facebook. “What’s happening right now, though, is that a few private companies are disseminating a massive amount of the world’s news and it’s largely happening inside black boxes,” Mr. Silverman told me last week, in his first interview since leaving the company. “I think figuring out ways to both help and, in some cases, force, large platforms to be more transparent with news and civic content as it’s in the process of being disseminated can ultimately help make social platforms better homes for public discourse — and in a lot of ways, help them live up to a lot of their original promise.” Much of what Americans know about what happens inside companies like Google and Facebook these days comes from employees who tire of the corporate spin and leak internal documents. Congress is responding to documents leaked first to The Wall Street Journal by a former Facebook product manager, Frances Haugen. The revelations in those documents confirmed and deepened the perception of an out-of-control information wasteland hinted at by CrowdTangle’s data. Mr. Silverman isn’t a leaker or a whistle-blower, and he declined to discuss details of his time at Facebook. But his defection from Silicon Valley to Capitol Hill is significant. He arrived with detailed knowledge of perhaps the most effective transparency tool in the history of social media, and he has helped write it into a piece of legislation that is notable for its technical savvy. Nathaniel Persily, the James B. McClatchy Professor of Law at Stanford University, who first suggested a version of the transparency legislation in October, said Mr. Silverman had been “instrumental” in shaping the section of the legislation that would authorize the Federal Trade Commission to force platforms to disclose, in real time, what information is spreading on them. The provision is part of a bill more broadly aimed at letting academic researchers conduct independent studies into the inner workings of the platforms and their social effects. As written, the legislation would apply to Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter and Snap — and would probably, a Senate aide said, also extend to Amazon. Washington is awash in proposals for reforming social media, but in a narrowly divided Congress, it’s little surprise that none have passed. Many Democrats believe that social media’s core problem is that dangerous far-right speech is being amplified. Many Republicans believe that the core problem is that the platforms are suppressing conservative political views. The new Senate legislation, which was introduced by two Democrats, Chris Coons and Amy Klobuchar, and a Republican, Rob Portman, may have a path toward passage because it doesn’t require taking a side in that argument. “It’s not taking a position on some of the big divisive issues on social media and tech and regulation,” Senator Coons said in an interview, but simply providing “more critically needed data and research.” Senator Portman said in an emailed statement that “every new disclosure of problematic activities by social media companies reignites calls for congressional action.” Before answering those calls, he said, “Congress should take a step back to ensure that we are not legislating in the dark.” For Mr. Silverman, the legislation is a return to politics. He came to the tech industry through an unusual path, which began in 2005 at the Center for Progressive Leadership, a nonprofit organization aimed at training a new generation of political leaders. He became interested in building online communities as a way to keep the program’s alumni connected. In 2011, he helped found a company then called OpenPage Labs, aimed at building social networks for progressive nonprofits using Facebook’s “open graph,” a short-lived program that allowed software developers to integrate their applications with Facebook. The most successful element of that company was its ability to measure what was happening on Facebook pages and groups, and the company began licensing its analytical tools to publishers, among others. A significant customer was the fast-growing progressive media start-up Upworthy in 2013, followed by a wave of other media companies. I first met Mr. Silverman in that period, and it was clear that his company’s insight into which stories were spreading fastest on Facebook offered a distinct advantage to writers and editors looking for traffic. In 2017, Facebook made the service free, and opened it up to thousands of new users. Eventually, human rights organizations and fact checkers seeking to understand their own societies and improve their media also started using it, as well as journalists who wanted to understand Facebook itself. “That was when we began to realize how much of the outside world was eager and depended on seeing what was happening on the platform,” Mr. Silverman said. But as the news about Facebook’s impact on society turned negative, CrowdTangle was increasingly seen internally as a threat. In July 2020, my colleague Kevin Roose started a Twitter account listing Facebook’s most engaged links every day, much of it inflammatory right-wing commentary. The account was an irritant to Facebook’s executives, “embarrassed by the disparity between what they thought Facebook was — a clean, well-lit public square where civility and tolerance reign — and the image they saw reflected in the Twitter lists,” as Mr. Roose put it after he obtained internal emails debating the future of CrowdTangle last July. Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice president for global affairs, complained in the emails that “our own tools are helping journos to consolidate the wrong narrative.” Brian Boland, a Facebook vice president who was Mr. Silverman’s boss before resigning in 2020, told Mr. Roose that the CrowdTangle data he used “told a story they didn’t like and frankly didn’t want to admit was true.” The company subsequently disbanded Mr. Silverman’s team, leaving CrowdTangle’s future in doubt. Mr. Silverman, who wouldn’t say how much he sold his company for but no doubt made a small fortune, said he had mixed feelings about his experience at Facebook. “They gave us a lot of freedom and resources and support to do this work for four years when a lot of platforms were doing nothing,” he said. And it is notable that one reason you’ve read so much about Facebook’s capacity for spreading terrible health information is simply that it’s easier to see into than YouTube or TikTok. But he said that the internal politics had turned against CrowdTangle. “There was a vision about transparency that I believed in and my team had come to believe in that it was clear we wouldn’t be able to pursue inside Facebook as much as we had in the past,” he said. About three weeks after Mr. Silverman left Facebook, Mr. Persily contacted him to say that Senator Coons’s office was interested in his help with the tech legislation. The bill was driven in part by the frustration of researchers at how hard it is to even define the problems posed by social platforms. Laura Edelson, a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering who studies misinformation on Facebook, said she had gone into the project thinking that she would simply confirm liberal concerns that right-wing content gets more engagement and promotion. But she said that she also found a “very high false positive rate for content being flagged, so conservatives probably are experiencing content being taken down incorrectly, while it’s also true that right-wing misinformation goes viral on Facebook.” Her project ended when Facebook disabled her account. The new legislation, she said, would be a “game changer.” Mr. Silverman said that he had been frustrated to see proposals for fixing social media that were “based on anecdotal evidence or folklore or urban myths about what’s happening on the platforms.” He said a better window into the platforms might also help observers untangle cause from effect across a global platform, and understand where Facebook is causing common problems and where it’s amplifying parochial ones. Mr. Roose’s list of viral right-wing stories, for instance, is a distinctly American phenomenon. Similar lists in other countries typically turn up cute animals or less partisan news, Mr. Silverman said. The legislation is being circulated in draft form for feedback from, among others, the tech companies themselves. A spokesman for Facebook’s parent company, Meta, Tucker Bounds, pointed to CrowdTangle’s technical limits and said that “a more rounded approach to transparency requires new tools.” (The company’s earlier attempts to displace CrowdTangle data with its own reporting foundered when the data proved unflattering, was suppressed and then leaked to my colleagues Davey Alba and Ryan Mac.) Still, CrowdTangle has made Facebook more transparent to outsiders than YouTube, TikTok or Snap. Mr. Bounds also said that Facebook was “the only major consumer platform to provide this level of transparency,” adding, “We plan to keep providing industry-leading transparency into how our products work and urge our competitors to do the same.” The Senate aide said the tech companies had only been heatedly opposed to one element: a tough enforcement mechanism that would suspend legal protections under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act for companies that don’t comply with demands that they make their inner workings available to researchers and the public. The aide said the legislation would be formally introduced early this year. And if the legislation passes, Facebook may live to regret the energy it spent working to shut Mr. Silverman’s window into the platform. But I suspect many of us will be grateful to rest the high-stakes debate about social media on shared facts, available in real time."

The government was set to overhaul its law governing women’s rights for the first time in decades, to refine the definition of sexual harassment, affirm prohibitions on workplace discrimination and ban forms of emotional abuse. For many women in China, the response was: Hm, really? The proposed revisions are the latest in a series of conflicting messages by the Chinese government about the country’s growing feminist movement. On paper, the changes, which China’s legislature reviewed for the first time last month, would seem to be a triumph for activists who have long worked to push gender equality into the Chinese mainstream. The Women’s Rights and Interests Protection Law has been substantially revised only once, in 2005, since it was enacted nearly three decades ago. The government has also recently emphasized its dedication to women’s employment rights, especially as it urges women to have more children amid a looming demographic crisis. The official newspaper of China’s Supreme Court explicitly tied the new three-child policy to the revision, which would codify prohibitions on employers’ asking women about their marital status or plans to have children. At the same time, the authorities, ever leery of grass-roots organizing, have detained outspoken feminist activists and sought to control the country’s fledgling #MeToo movement. Sexual harassment lawsuits — already rare — have been dismissed. Women have been fired or fined for lodging accusations. When Peng Shuai, a star tennis player, recently said on social media that a top Chinese leader had pressured her into sex, she was censored within minutes, and many worry that she is under surveillance. Women have also been increasingly pushed out of the workplace and into traditional gender roles since China’s leader, Xi Jinping, assumed power. Some fear that the campaign to encourage childbirth could turn coercive. The contradictions were clear in a recent article in the Global Times, a Communist Party-owned tabloid, about Chinese feminist advocacy. While the article hailed the proposed legal revisions as a “landmark move,” it also denounced “spooky ‘feminism’” and derided the “so-called MeToo movement” as yet another Western cudgel against China.  Feminist activists have warned against giving the revisions too much weight. Feng Yuan, the founder of Equality, a Beijing-based advocacy group, welcomed the move for its potential to impose “moral responsibility and pressure” on institutions. But she noted that the draft does not specify clear punishments for the violations it outlines. Instead, it uses phrases such as “will be ordered to make corrections” or “may be criticized and educated.” “This law, to be honest, is more of a gesture than a specific plan of operation,” Ms. Feng said. The gesture, at least, is extensive. As revised, the law would offer the most comprehensive legal definition yet of sexual harassment, to include behaviors such as sending unwanted sexually explicit images or pressuring someone into a relationship in exchange for benefits. It also instructs schools and employers to introduce anti-harassment training and channels for complaints. The law would also codify women’s right to ask for compensation for housework during divorce proceedings — following the first-of-its-kind decision by a Chinese divorce court last year to award a woman more than $7,700 for her labor during her marriage. Some provisions would go beyond those in other countries. In particular, the draft bans the use of “superstition” or other “emotional control” against women. While the draft does not offer further details, state media reports have said those bans would cover pickup artistry. Pickup artistry — a practice that arrived in China from the United States — commonly refers to the use of manipulative techniques, including gaslighting, to demean women and lure them into having sex. It became a booming industry in China, with thousands of companies and websites promising to teach techniques, and it has been widely condemned by both the government and social media users. Elsewhere, bans on emotional coercion are spotty. Britain banned it in 2015, while the United States has no federal law against it. Yet the truly novel aspects of the Chinese law are limited. Many of the provisions already exist in other laws or regulations but have been poorly enforced. China’s labor law bans discrimination based on sex. The compensation-for-housework measure was included in a new civil code that went into effect last year. While the law affirms women’s right to sue, its emphasis is largely on authorizing government officials to take top-down action against offenders, said Darius Longarino, a researcher at Yale Law School who studies China. “The priority should be on bottom-up enforcement, where you empower individuals who have been harassed to use the law to protect their rights,” he said. It is rare for victims of harassment to go to court. An analysis by Mr. Longarino and others found that 93 percent of sexual harassment cases decided in China between 2018 and 2020 were brought not by the alleged victim but by the alleged harasser, claiming defamation or wrongful termination. Women who have made public harassment claims have been forced to pay those they accused. Nonlegal complaints can bring heavy consequences, too. In December, Alibaba, the e-commerce giant, fired a woman who had accused a superior of raping her. The company said that she had “spread falsehoods,” even though it had earlier fired the man she accused. Even when women do sue their harassers, they face steep hurdles. Perhaps the most high-profile #MeToo case to go to court was brought by Zhou Xiaoxuan, a former intern at China’s state broadcaster, who asserted that Zhu Jun, a star anchor, had forcibly kissed and groped her. But the case faced years of delays. In September, a court dismissed the claim and said she had not provided enough evidence, though Ms. Zhou said the judges had rejected her efforts to introduce more. In an interview, Ms. Zhou expressed skepticism that the revised law would change much. “The judicial environment won’t be changed by one or two legal amendments,” she said. “It will take every court, every judge really understanding the plight of those who suffer from sexual harassment. This is probably still a very long, hard road.” Emotional control could prove even harder to substantiate, especially in a country where open discussion of mental health can still carry a stigma. Guo Jing, a feminist activist from Wuhan, noted that psychologists are rarely admitted as expert witnesses in Chinese courts, and that judges might be skeptical of claims of depression or other mental health conditions. And patriarchal attitudes still remain deeply entrenched. After the draft revisions were published, several male bloggers with large followings on the social media platform Weibo denounced the provisions against degrading or harassing women online, saying they would give “radical” feminists too much power to silence their critics. Still, some women remain optimistic about the possible power of the proposed changes. A woman in southern Guangdong Province who asked to use only her last name, Han, out of fears for her safety, said that she had endured years of physical and emotional abuse by her ex-husband. Even though she managed to secure a divorce last year, he continues to stalk and threaten her, she said. She obtained a restraining order, viewed by The New York Times, that cited chat logs and recordings. Yet even with the restraining order, when Ms. Han called the police, they often told her that threats alone were not enough for them to take action, as he had not physically harmed her, she said. If the law is revised, she continued, the police will be forced to recognize that she has a right to seek their help. “If the law changes, I will be even more convinced that everything I’m doing right now is right,” she said."

Mr. Hamilton, an assistant equipment manager for the Vancouver Canucks, had a small mole there. It measured about two centimeters and was irregularly shaped and red-brown in color — possible characteristics of a cancerous mole, signs that Ms. Popovici had learned to spot while volunteering at hospitals as a nursing assistant. Maybe he already knew? But if so, why was the mole still there? She concluded that Mr. Hamilton did not know. “I need to tell him,” Ms. Popovici, 22, told her parents at the Oct. 23 N.H.L. game between the Canucks and the Seattle Kraken at the Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle. Ms. Popovici typed a message on her phone and waited for the game to end. After waving several times, she finally drew Mr. Hamilton’s attention, and placed her phone against the plexiglass. “The mole on the back of your neck is possibly cancerous. Please go see a doctor!” the message read, with the words “mole,” “cancer” and “doctor” colored bright red. Mr. Hamilton said he looked at the message, rubbed the back of his neck and kept walking, thinking, “Well, that’s weird.” Ms. Popovici said she regretted the message and thought at the time, “Maybe that was inappropriate of me to bring up.” After the game, Mr. Hamilton went home and asked his partner if she could spot the mole. She could. He asked the team doctor if it was worrisome. It was. Then after he had it removed, he waited for the biopsy results to see if the fan sitting behind the team’s bench had been right. Indeed, Ms. Popovici was correct, and she had just saved his life. “She took me out of a slow fire,” Mr. Hamilton said at a news conference on Saturday, his voice quavering at times. “And the words out of the doctor’s mouth were if I ignored that for four to five years, I wouldn’t be here.” Specifically, doctors later told him, it was type-2 malignant melanoma, a type of skin cancer that, because it was detected early, could be easily removed and treated. “With melanoma, just like many other cancers, the success of the treatment or the cure is often dependent on the stage of disease — and the sooner you find something, the better it is,” said Dr. Ashwani Rajput, the director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. Mr. Hamilton recalled the doctor telling him, “I’m going to diagnose you with cancer and I’m going to cure you of cancer in the same phone call.” Once he knew he was fine, Mr. Hamilton asked the Canucks franchise to help him find the woman he described as “a hero.” Mr. Hamilton wrote a letter that was posted on the team’s Twitter account on Saturday that said: “To this woman I am trying to find, you changed my life, and now I want to find you to say THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH! Problem is, I don’t know who you are or where you are from.” It took less than three hours to find Ms. Popovici, who had been sleeping at her home in Tacoma, Wash., that afternoon after working overnight as a crisis intervention specialist at a suicide prevention hotline. She woke up to texts and missed calls from her mother, Yukyung Nelson. “I think she was just shocked,” Ms. Nelson said. Ms. Popovici, who had already planned to attend the game on Saturday between the Canucks and Kraken in Seattle, was invited by both teams to meet Mr. Hamilton. He had just finished a news conference about what had happened. Referring to Ms. Popovici, he told reporters, “My mom wants her to know that she loves her.” Later that afternoon, he repeated the message to Ms. Popovici in person. “It was the sweetest thing when you were talking about your mom,” she told him as they met properly for the first time. At the game, both teams presented Ms. Popovici a combined $10,000 scholarship to use for medical school expenses. “Some people are saying this is not even going to be a drop in the bucket, but trust me, it feels like everything,” she said. “I’m really just so grateful.” She watched the game from the same seat where she had spotted the mole. Everything, she thought, had gone right that day: A future medical student had been sitting close enough to a team bench where an assistant equipment manager was, thankfully, not wearing a jacket large enough to cover the cancerous mole on his neck. “This entire experience has been so rare,” Ms. Popovici said. “And I will just cherish it.”"

It’s distracting and irritating. How do I get it to stop? And should I be concerned? Eyelid spasms, while annoying, are “rarely a sign of something serious,” said Stephanie Erwin, an optometrist at Cleveland Clinic’s Cole Eye Institute. The most common type of eye twitch is a series of muscle contractions called eyelid myokymia, which produces involuntary and intermittent contractions of the eyelid, typically the lower one. Only one eye is affected at a time because the twitch originates in the muscle surrounding the eye, and not the nerve that controls the blink reflex, which sends the same message to both eyes simultaneously, Dr. Erwin added. The spasms can last from hours to days to months. “If the twitching persists for a long period of time, or is accompanied by additional symptoms, it is a good idea to be checked by an eye doctor to make sure nothing else is going on,” she said. If the twitching spreads to other muscles in the face or if you notice both eyes are twitching at the same time, those are indications of a more serious problem. Other red flags include a drooping eyelid or a red eye. But if just one eyelid is twitching on and off, it is usually a harmless (and often exasperating) case of eyelid myokymia. As for why it happens: “Nobody knows exactly why,” said Dr. Alice Lorch, an ophthalmologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in Boston. Sometimes it stems from a small irritation, for example a contact lens rubbing against the eyelid, she added. But more commonly, it is stress, lack of sleep or excessive caffeine intake that brings on eyelid twitching, the experts said. Dry eye, a common affliction among those who stare at screens most of the day, is another culprit. Studies have indicated that we blink less when looking at digital devices, which makes our eyes feel dry. There is no quick fix for an eyelid twitch once it starts, Dr. Lorch said. But artificial tears, eyedrops that lubricate the eye, can help. Ideally, choose ones that are preservative-free, because chemical preservatives can sometimes be irritating. You can also try massaging your eyes in the shower or covering your eyes with a damp, warm washcloth right before bed, she added, which will help relax your eye muscles and open the glands on the margins of the eyelids. This increases oil flow into the eyes and slows down tear evaporation. Other preventive measures include getting more rest and reducing stress. “Twitching is a signal by your body asking you to slow down,” said Dr. Raj Maturi, a spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Decreasing caffeine intake can also help prevent eye twitching, because large amounts of caffeine can lead to muscle tension. Having one or two cups of coffee each day should be fine, Dr. Lorch said. It’s also important to stay hydrated and eat a balanced diet that includes foods high in potassium (potatoes, bananas and lentils are great sources), magnesium (found in leafy green vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts and fish) and calcium (try dairy, sardines, dark leafy greens or fortified breakfast cereals), since imbalances in these minerals may lead to twitching. Tonic water is sometimes touted as a remedy for eyelid twitching because it contains a small amount of quinine. Quinine, a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat malaria, has also been used off-label to treat nighttime leg cramps, something the F.D.A. says is neither safe nor effective. There is no scientific evidence that tonic water prevents or alleviates eyelid twitching. Rarely, eye doctors will use Botox to stop the twitching by injecting a small amount into the orbicularis muscle that surrounds the eyelids, but this is done “only in severe cases,” Dr. Erwin said. Eyelid myokymia usually goes away on its own without medical intervention, the experts said. For most patients, it’s just a matter of resting, taking steps to reduce stress, lubricating the eye and waiting it out."

The decision by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok came as widespread protests gripped the northeast African nation. Protesters denounced not just the coup that unseated Mr. Hamdok in October but also the deal that returned him to power in November. Opposition political groups and other major political forces rejected it as an unacceptable concession to the military, which has controlled Sudan for most of its history since it became an independent state more than six decades ago. In a televised address on Sunday evening, Mr. Hamdok said that repeated mediation attempts had failed in recent days and that the country needed to engage in a new dialogue to to chart a path toward a democratic, civilian state. His speech came just hours after security forces killed three protesters, according to the pro-democracy Central Committee of Sudan Doctors, pushing the total number of people killed in the two months since the coup to 57. For weeks, amid speculation that the prime minister might step down, local and international leaders pressed Mr. Hamdok to hold fast. But in the end, it did not work. “I tried as much as I could to avoid our country from sliding into disaster,” Mr. Hamdok said as he announced his resignation. “But despite my efforts to achieve the desired and necessary consensus to give citizens security, peace, justice and to stop bloodshed, that did not happen.” Months of turmoil have threatened to upend hopes for establishing a democracy in Sudan that were born after the 2019 ouster of the country’s longtime dictator, Omar Hassan al-Bashir. The political instability has been compounded by other challenges, including dire economic problems and fresh violence in the restive Darfur region in western Sudan. Mr. Hamdok was removed from office in a coup on Oct. 25, then returned to office in late November after four weeks of house arrest. He was reinstated only after he signed a new power-sharing agreement with the military leaders who had deposed him in the first place. The occasion was marked by a televised ceremony in the presidential palace, with the prime minister appearing alongside Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the army chief who ousted him and, at one point, detained him in his own residence. The two men signed a 14-point agreement which they cast as an important step forward. It included commitments to release all political detainees and to preserve the nation’s path toward democracy. The hope was that Mr. Hamdok’s return to office might end the protests that followed the coup and the brutal reprisals by the security forces. But it did not turn out that way. Members of Sudan’s largest political organization, the Umma party, rejected the deal. So did some members of the Forces of Freedom and Change, a civilian coalition that shared power with the military until the coup. The agreement also did not sit well with ordinary citizens. Jeering protesters gathered outside the presidential palace in Khartoum and elsewhere in the country — including on Sunday, the day Mr. Hamdok resigned. They called for the coup leaders to be prosecuted. Mr. Hamdok, in particular, was accused of providing a fig leaf that allowed the military to continue dominating the political sphere. Security officers have responded to the demonstrations with heavy force, lobbing tear gas and shooting rubber and live bullets, according to activists and protesters. Hundreds of people have been injured nationwide. The United Nations human rights office says 13 women and girls have accused the security forces of sexual violence and has called for “a prompt, independent and thorough investigation.” The United States, the European Union and Canada, among others, last month condemned “the use of sexual and gender-based violence as a weapon to drive women away from demonstrations and silence women’s voices.” Off the political stage, other events have pushed Sudan toward the breaking point. In recent weeks, dozens of people have been killed and their villages burned in violence between herders and farmers in West Darfur state, the United Nations said. And Sudan’s economy is teetering, with pandemic-related shocks and closings contributing to growing unemployment and rising food prices, according to the World Bank. That is one area that many Sudanese hoped Mr. Hamdok, a British-educated economist who once worked for the United Nations, would fix, when he was appointed prime minister in 2019 following the tumultuous protests that led to the ouster of Mr. al-Bashir. Under an earlier civilian-military power-sharing agreement reached then, Mr. Hamdok was named to lead Sudan through a transitional period of three years, with the goal of holding free elections. His government succeeded in a number of ways, by broadening personal freedoms, banning female genital mutilation, signing a deal with rebel groups and helping to get Sudan removed from a U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. “I have had the honor of serving my countrymen for more than two years,” Mr. Hamdok said Sunday, “and during this period, I have sometimes done well, and I have sometimes failed.” The civilian-military coalition was fraught, in part because the generals worried that their privileges, long jealously guarded, might evaporate. With Mr. Hamdok’s resignation, protests are likely to continue, analysts said, intensifying pressure against the military. That has the potential to push members of the armed groups to abandon their deal with the government, further undermining the legitimacy of General al-Burhan and his allies. “The option of a civilian-military partnership is getting bleaker by the day,” said Jihad Mashamoun, a Sudanese researcher and analyst. To complete the country’s transition to democracy, Mr. Hamdok said Sunday, it is paramount to open a dialogue that will bring all Sudanese people to the table. “Our country is going through a dangerous turning point that may threaten its entire survival if it is not remedied soon,” he said."

In the third quarter in East Rutherford, N.J., Brown took off his helmet, jersey and shoulder pads, then shed his undershirt, before jogging to the visiting team’s locker room through the end zone while making a peace sign gesture. Brown, who had three catches for 26 yards on Sunday, appeared to react to being benched in the game by Coach Bruce Arians. After his departure, the Buccaneers came back and won, 28-24. On a video conference call with reporters after the game, Arians implied the team would release Brown. “He is no longer a Buc,” Arians said. “That’s the end of the story. Let’s talk about the guys that went out there and won the game.” Quarterback Tom Brady, who had recruited Brown to Tampa Bay, called the outburst a “difficult situation.” “I think everybody should hopefully do what they can to help him in ways that he really needs it,” Brady said. “We all love him. We care about him deeply. We want to see him be his best, and unfortunately it won’t be with our team.” The episode was the latest in a string of infractions and incidents in Brown’s 12-year N.F.L. career. He returned to play last week from a three-game suspension that resulted from an N.F.L. investigation that found he gave the team a fake Covid-19 vaccination card. After he caught 10 passes for 101 yards last week against the Carolina Panthers, Brown brashly refused to answer a reporter’s question about his suspension, saying: “I don’t want to talk about that. You guys is all drama. It’s all about football.” The Buccaneers signed Brown in October 2020, and he started playing the next month, after he served an eight-game suspension levied by the N.F.L. for his role in a dispute with a moving company employee, for which he pleaded no contest to burglary and battery charges and received two years’ probation. He was also penalized for sending threatening texts to a woman who had accused him of sexual misconduct. Despite his tumultuous exit from the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2019, which followed months of Brown’s public criticism of quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, the Oakland Raiders signed the receiver that year. His tenure in Oakland was marked by unusual circumstances, including his absence from training camp with a frostbite injury. He was released without having played in a game after an altercation with Raiders General Manager Mike Mayock. The New England Patriots signed Brown days later, in part because Brady, in the quarterback’s final season with the team, lobbied on his behalf. Three days after Brown’s addition, he was accused in a lawsuit of sexual assault, a case that has since been settled. Brown played in one regular-season game for the Patriots before Sports Illustrated reported that he had sent intimidating text messages to a different woman who had accused him of sexual assault. The Patriots released him on Sept. 20, 2019, and during his free agency, the N.F.L. levied the eight-game suspension. Tampa Bay signed Brown in 2020, as his suspension ended. Arians said at the time that he would have little tolerance for Brown. “We’re on the hook for nothing in this deal,” Arians said in an October news conference. “He screws up one time, he’s gone. I don’t think he will because he wants to play.” But Arians had since voiced his support for Brown even after the receiver was suspended over the vaccination fraud. Brown has been selected to seven Pro Bowls, and in two seasons with the Buccaneers, he has recorded 1,002 yards and eight touchdowns, as well as one during last season’s Super Bowl win over Kansas City."

Read more in a note from Times Opinion’s politics editor Ezekiel Kweku in our Opinion Today newsletter. One year after the smoke and broken glass, the mock gallows and the very real bloodshed of that awful day, it is tempting to look back and imagine that we can, in fact, simply look back. To imagine that what happened on Jan. 6, 2021 — a deadly riot at the seat of American government, incited by a defeated president amid a last-ditch effort to thwart the transfer of power to his successor — was horrifying but that it is in the past and that we as a nation have moved on. This is an understandable impulse. After four years of chaos, cruelty and incompetence, culminating in a pandemic and the once-unthinkable trauma of Jan. 6, most Americans were desperate for some peace and quiet. On the surface, we have achieved that. Our political life seems more or less normal these days, as the president pardons turkeys and Congress quarrels over spending bills. But peel back a layer, and things are far from normal. Jan. 6 is not in the past; it is every day. It is regular citizens who threaten election officials and other public servants, who ask, “When can we use the guns?” and who vow to murder politicians who dare to vote their conscience. It is Republican lawmakers scrambling to make it harder for people to vote and easier to subvert their will if they do. It is Donald Trump who continues to stoke the flames of conflict with his rampant lies and limitless resentments and whose twisted version of reality still dominates one of the nation’s two major political parties. In short, the Republic faces an existential threat from a movement that is openly contemptuous of democracy and has shown that it is willing to use violence to achieve its ends. No self-governing society can survive such a threat by denying that it exists. Rather, survival depends on looking back and forward at the same time. Truly grappling with the threat ahead means taking full account of the terror of that day a year ago. Thanks largely to the dogged work of a bipartisan committee in the House of Representatives, this reckoning is underway. We know now that the violence and mayhem broadcast live around the world was only the most visible and visceral part of the effort to overturn the election. The effort extended all the way into the Oval Office, where Mr. Trump and his allies plotted a constitutional self-coup. We know now that top Republican lawmakers and right-wing media figures privately understood how dangerous the riot was and pleaded with Mr. Trump to call a halt to it, even as they publicly pretended otherwise. We know now that those who may have critical information about the planning and execution of the attack are refusing to cooperate with Congress, even if it means being charged with criminal contempt. For now, the committee’s work continues. It has scheduled a series of public hearings in the new year to lay out these and other details, and it plans to release a full report of its findings before the midterm elections — after which, should Republicans regain control of the House as expected, the committee will undoubtedly be dissolved. This is where looking forward comes in. Over the past year, Republican lawmakers in 41 states have been trying to advance the goals of the Jan. 6 rioters — not by breaking laws but by making them. Hundreds of bills have been proposed and nearly three dozen laws have been passed that empower state legislatures to sabotage their own elections and overturn the will of their voters, according to a running tally by a nonpartisan consortium of pro-democracy organizations. Some bills would change the rules to make it easier for lawmakers to reject the votes of their citizens if they don’t like the outcome. Others replace professional election officials with partisan actors who have a vested interest in seeing their preferred candidate win. Yet more attempt to criminalize human errors by election officials, in some cases even threatening prison. Many of these laws are being proposed and passed in crucial battleground states like Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, the Trump campaign targeted voting results in all these states, suing for recounts or trying to intimidate officials into finding “missing” votes. The effort failed, thanks primarily to the professionalism and integrity of election officials. Many of those officials have since been stripped of their power or pushed out of office and replaced by people who openly say the last election was fraudulent. Thus the Capitol riot continues in statehouses across the country, in a bloodless, legalized form that no police officer can arrest and that no prosecutor can try in court. This isn’t the first time state legislatures have tried to wrest control of electoral votes from their own people, nor is it the first time that the dangers of such a ploy have been pointed out. In 1891, President Benjamin Harrison warned Congress of the risk that such a “trick” could determine the outcome of a presidential election. The Constitution guarantees to all Americans a republican form of government, Harrison said. “The essential features of such a government are the right of the people to choose their own officers” and to have their votes counted equally in making that choice. “Our chief national danger,” he continued, is “the overthrow of majority control by the suppression or perversion of popular suffrage.” If a state legislature were to succeed in substituting its own will for that of its voters, “it is not too much to say that the public peace might be seriously and widely endangered.” A healthy, functioning political party faces its electoral losses by assessing what went wrong and redoubling its efforts to appeal to more voters the next time. The Republican Party, like authoritarian movements the world over, has shown itself recently to be incapable of doing this. Party leaders’ rhetoric suggests they see it as the only legitimate governing power and thus portrays anyone else’s victory as the result of fraud — hence the foundational falsehood that spurred the Jan. 6 attack, that Joe Biden didn’t win the election. “The thing that’s most concerning is that it has endured in the face of all evidence,” said Representative Adam Kinzinger, one of the vanishingly few Republicans in Congress who remain committed to empirical reality and representative democracy. “And I’ve gotten to wonder if there is actually any evidence that would ever change certain people’s minds.” The answer, for now, appears to be no. Polling finds that the overwhelming majority of Republicans believe that President Biden was not legitimately elected and that about one-third approve of using violence to achieve political goals. Put those two numbers together, and you have a recipe for extreme danger. Political violence is not an inevitable outcome. Republican leaders could help by being honest with their voters and combating the extremists in their midst. Throughout American history, party leaders, from Abraham Lincoln to Margaret Chase Smith to John McCain, have stood up for the union and democracy first, to their everlasting credit. Democrats aren’t helpless, either. They hold unified power in Washington, for the last time in what may be a long time. Yet they have so far failed to confront the urgency of this moment — unwilling or unable to take action to protect elections from subversion and sabotage. Blame Senator Joe Manchin or Senator Kyrsten Sinema, but the only thing that matters in the end is whether you get it done. For that reason, Mr. Biden and other leading Democrats should make use of what remaining power they have to end the filibuster for voting rights legislation, even if nothing else. Whatever happens in Washington, in the months and years to come, Americans of all stripes who value their self-government must mobilize at every level — not simply once every four years but today and tomorrow and the next day — to win elections and help protect the basic functions of democracy. If people who believe in conspiracy theories can win, so can those who live in the reality-based world. Above all, we should stop underestimating the threat facing the country. Countless times over the past six years, up to and including the events of Jan. 6, Mr. Trump and his allies openly projected their intent to do something outrageous or illegal or destructive. Every time, the common response was that they weren’t serious or that they would never succeed. How many times will we have to be proved wrong before we take it seriously? The sooner we do, the sooner we might hope to salvage a democracy that is in grave danger."

Following a normal ultrasound, she was confident enough to tell her 3-year-old son his “brother or sister” was in her belly. But a few weeks later, as she was driving her son home from school, her doctor’s office called. A prenatal blood test indicated her fetus might be missing part of a chromosome, which could lead to serious ailments and mental illness. Sitting on the couch that evening with her husband, she cried as she explained they might be facing a decision on terminating the pregnancy. He sat quietly with the news. “How is this happening to me?” Ms. Geller, 32, recalled thinking. The next day, doctors used a long, painful needle to retrieve a small piece of her placenta. It was tested and showed the initial result was wrong. She now has a 6-month-old, Emmanuel, who shows no signs of the condition he screened positive for. Ms. Geller had been misled by a wondrous promise that Silicon Valley technology has made to expectant mothers: that a few vials of their blood, drawn in the first trimester, can allow companies to detect serious developmental problems in the DNA of the fetus with remarkable accuracy. In just over a decade, the tests have gone from laboratory experiments to an industry that serves more than a third of the pregnant women in America, luring major companies like Labcorp and Quest Diagnostics into the business, alongside many start-ups. The tests initially looked for Down syndrome and worked very well. But as manufacturers tried to outsell each other, they began offering additional screenings for increasingly rare conditions. The grave predictions made by those newer tests are usually wrong, an examination by The New York Times has found. That includes the screening that came back positive for Ms. Geller, which looks for Prader-Willi syndrome, a condition that offers little chance of living independently as an adult. Studies have found its positive results are incorrect more than 90 percent of the time. Nonetheless, on product brochures and test result sheets, companies describe the tests to pregnant women and their doctors as near certain. They advertise their findings as “reliable” and “highly accurate,” offering “total confidence” and “peace of mind” for patients who want to know as much as possible. Some of the companies offer tests without publishing any data on how well they perform, or point to numbers for their best screenings while leaving out weaker ones. Others base their claims on studies in which only one or two pregnancies actually had the condition in question. This isn’t the first time Silicon Valley technology has been used to build a business around blood tests. Years before the first prenatal testing company opened, another start-up, Theranos, made claims that it could run more than a thousand tests on a tiny blood sample, before it collapsed amid allegations of fraud. In contrast with Theranos, the science behind these companies’ ability to test blood for common disorders is not in question. Experts say it has revolutionized Down syndrome screening, significantly reducing the need for riskier tests. However, the same technology — known as noninvasive prenatal testing, or NIPT — performs much worse when it looks for less common conditions. Most are caused by small missing pieces of chromosomes called microdeletions. Others stem from missing or extra copies of entire chromosomes. They can have a wide range of symptoms, including intellectual disability, heart defects, a shortened life span or a high infant mortality rate. Not every patient is screened for every condition; doctors decide what to order, and most companies sell microdeletion testing as an optional add-on to the Down screening. Most test makers don’t say how often their microdeletion tests are being performed. But it is clear some of the tests are in widespread use. One large test maker, Natera, said that in 2020 it performed more than 400,000 screenings for one microdeletion — the equivalent of testing roughly 10 percent of pregnant women in America. To evaluate the newer tests, The Times interviewed researchers and then combined data from multiple studies to produce the best estimates available of how well the five most common microdeletion tests perform. The analysis showed that positive results on those tests are incorrect about 85 percent of the time. Experts say there is no single threshold for how often a test needs to get positive results right to be worth offering. They note that when the tests do accurately identify an abnormality, it can give expectant parents time to learn about and prepare for challenges to come. Some said one common microdeletion screening, for a condition called DiGeorge syndrome, has the most potential to do good. But there are hundreds of microdeletion syndromes, and the most expansive tests look for between five and seven, meaning women shouldn’t take a negative result as proof their baby doesn’t have a genetic disorder. For patients who are especially worried, obstetricians who study these screenings currently recommend other types of testing, which come with a small risk of miscarriage but are more reliable. Some said the blood screenings that look for the rarest conditions are good for little more than bolstering testing companies’ bottom lines. “It’s a little like running mammograms on kids,” said Mary Norton, an obstetrician and geneticist at the University of California, San Francisco. “The chance of breast cancer is so low, so why are you doing it? I think it’s purely a marketing thing.” There are few restrictions on what test makers can offer. The Food and Drug Administration often requires evaluations of how frequently other consequential medical tests are right and whether shortfalls are clearly explained to patients and doctors. But the F.D.A. does not regulate this type of test. Alberto Gutierrez, the former director of the F.D.A. office that oversees many medical tests, reviewed marketing materials from three testing companies and described them as “problematic.” “I think the information they provide is misleading,” he said. Patients who receive a positive result are supposed to pursue follow-up testing, which often requires a drawing of amniotic fluid or a sample of placental tissue. Those tests can cost thousands of dollars, come with a small risk of miscarriage and can’t be performed until later in pregnancy — in some states, past the point where abortions are legal. The companies have known for years that the follow-up testing doesn’t always happen. A 2014 study found that 6 percent of patients who screened positive obtained an abortion without getting another test to confirm the result. That same year The Boston Globe quoted a doctor describing three terminations following unconfirmed positive results. Three geneticists recounted more recent examples in interviews with The Times. One described a case in which the follow-up testing revealed the fetus was healthy. But by the time the results came, the patient had already ended her pregnancy. After being presented with some of The Times’s reporting, half a dozen of the largest prenatal testing companies declined interview requests. They issued written statements that said patients should always review results with a doctor, and cautioned that the tests are meant not to diagnose a condition but rather to identify high-risk patients in need of additional testing. In interviews, 14 patients who got false positives said the experience was agonizing. They recalled frantically researching conditions they’d never heard of, followed by sleepless nights and days hiding their bulging bellies from friends. Eight said they never received any information about the possibility of a false positive, and five recalled that their doctor treated the test results as definitive. When Meredith Bannon’s pregnancy tested positive for DiGeorge syndrome, a nurse called and told her she and her husband would soon face “tough decisions” related to their child’s “quality of life,” which Ms. Bannon took to mean a choice about whether to end the pregnancy. The call came as Ms. Bannon was driving to her parents’ house, with her son in the back seat wearing a “big brother” T-shirt. “I was coming home to tell them that I was pregnant, but instead I had to tell them the news I got this horrible result back,” Ms. Bannon recalled. Further testing revealed that the result was wrong. Her baby is due in April. Some women began tentatively planning abortions after receiving positive screenings. “I couldn’t help but have termination on my mind,” said Allison Mihalich, 33, whose screening incorrectly indicated her baby might have Turner syndrome, which can cause infertility and heart defects. (Studies show that the test’s positive results are wrong 74 percent of the time.) She lived in Indiana at the time and recalled scrambling to arrange follow-up testing before the state’s 22-week abortion ban. Between 2011 and 2013, a small California-based biotech company, Sequenom, tripled in size. The key to its success: MaterniT21, a new prenatal screening test that did remarkably well at detecting Down syndrome. Older screening tests took months and required multiple blood tests. This new one generated fewer false positives with a single blood draw. The test could also determine the sex of a fetus. It quickly became a hit. “You had people walking in saying, ‘I want this sex test,’” recalled Dr. Anjali Kaimal, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital. Competitors began launching their own tests. Today, analyst estimates of the market’s size range from $600 million into the billions, and the number of women taking these tests is expected to double by 2025. As companies began looking for ways to differentiate their products, many decided to start screening for more and rarer disorders. All the screenings could run on the same blood draw, and doctors already order many tests during short prenatal care visits, meaning some probably thought little of tacking on a few more. For the testing company, however, adding microdeletions can double what an insurer pays — from an average of $695 for the basic tests to $1,349 for the expanded panel, according to the health data company Concert Genetics. (Patients whose insurance didn’t fully cover the tests describe being billed wildly different figures, ranging from a few hundred to thousands of dollars.) But these conditions were so rare that there were few instances for the tests to find. Take Natera, which ran 400,000 tests in 2020 for DiGeorge syndrome, a disorder associated with heart defects and intellectual disability. Natera declined an interview request after The Times presented its reporting. In statements, it said that the early detection of DiGeorge syndrome can “profoundly improve” patient outcomes and stressed how infrequently it identifies some of the other conditions. (It said the screening that gave a false positive for Prader-Willi syndrome in Ms. Geller’s pregnancy, for example, had returned positive results only 113 times since 2015.) It pointed to its recent study of 20,000 pregnant women that found DiGeorge syndrome occurs in 1 in 1,600 births — twice as common as other estimates. The company offers free genetic counseling to patients who screen positive. Natera also publishes data on how often its positive results are right and includes that information on patient results sheets. Other companies release little information about how many tests they sell, and far less research on how well their screenings work. Myriad Genetics’s prenatal test, Prequel, offers five microdeletion screenings, even though its study on the test includes just two confirmed cases of microdeletions. In a statement, Myriad estimated that only one in 9,000 of its patients screens positive for a microdeletion. It said its data showed a “very small fraction” of those are wrong, but declined to provide specific figures. Some companies test for conditions so rare that there are few known examples for comparison. Both Labcorp, which purchased Sequenom, and Myriad Genetics offer screenings for one disorder that is so rare its prevalence is unknown, and another, called Jacobsen syndrome, that affects 1 in 100,000 births. Dr. Diana Bianchi runs a National Institutes of Health laboratory studying prenatal blood screenings. She said of Jacobsen syndrome, “I’ve never seen a case of that in my 20-plus years of practicing genetics.” Those shortfalls are rarely referenced when companies explain the tests to doctors and patients. A Labcorp MaterniT21 lab report tells patients the test “detected” a problem, even though most studies show positives on that screening are usually wrong. Myriad Genetics advertised “total confidence in every result” on its prenatal testing website but said nothing about how often false positives can occur. After The Times inquired about these tests, Myriad took down that language. The Times reviewed 17 patient and doctor brochures from eight of the testing companies, including Natera, Labcorp, Quest and smaller competitors. Ten of the brochures never mention that a false positive can happen. Only one mentioned how often each test gets positive results wrong. Genetic counselors who have dealt with false positives say some doctors may not understand how poorly the tests work. And even when caregivers do correctly interpret the information, patients may still be inclined to believe the confident-sounding results sheets. When Cloey Canida, 25, got a positive result from Roche’s Harmony test in September, the result sheet seemed clear: It said her daughter had a “greater than 99/100” probability of being born with Patau syndrome, a condition that babies often do not survive beyond a week. Her obstetrician tried to reassure her, citing independent data showing that for a woman her age, 93 percent of positives turn out to be wrong. But Ms. Canida couldn’t stop thinking about the result sheet. She recalls crying during an ultrasound, thinking it was one of the few times she’d see her child moving. After spending $1,200 on follow-up tests, she learned that her pregnancy was healthy, and that her daughter would not be born with Patau syndrome. She is now in her third trimester. “I wish that we would have been informed of the false positive rate before I agreed to the test,” she said. “I was given zero information about that.” Roche, which recently sold the Harmony test to another company, said in a statement that “all women should discuss their results with their health care provider” before making any decisions based on screening results. Three experts reviewed marketing materials and results sheets for The Times and identified obvious reasons a patient would be confused. “These numbers are meaningless,” said Mr. Gutierrez, the former F.D.A. official, after reviewing an advertisement for the Quest Diagnostics QNatal Advanced Test. The test is advertised as getting positive microdeletion results right 75 percent of the time. But that figure comes from a single study that included nine confirmed cases of microdeletions, for a test that screens for seven such disorders. The company doesn’t specify how the tests perform individually, and declined to provide that data. (In a statement, Quest said its test has “excellent performance.”) The F.D.A. considered regulating these tests a decade ago, but backed away. If the agency had oversight, Mr. Gutierrez said, Quest would be required to publish a brochure, but “it would not look like this.” Nonetheless, companies are charging ahead, viewing microdeletions as a major business opportunity — especially if they can persuade more doctors to order them and more insurers to cover them. Myriad Genetics, which owns the Prequel test, has told investors that it plans to start a “next-generation” microdeletion screening in 2022, and that it will lobby the professional society for obstetricians to begin recommending the test to its members. Natera has performed more than two million screenings for Down syndrome since 2013. It went public in 2015, and the value of its stock has grown to $8.8 billion. With its expanded panel of screenings, the company sees more growth ahead. “This is a really significant moment for the microdeletions business,” the company’s chief executive, Steve Chapman, said at an investor conference last January. The company’s 2020 revenues were $391 million, and it projected its 2021 revenues to exceed $615 million. But if more insurers begin paying for microdeletion tests, Mr. Chapman said, the potential is “enormous” — it could bring in up to another $300 million every year."

Three days later, she was sick with Covid-19, one of about 2,000 people who fell ill as a result of the two-day event. “We did so well; we followed the rules,” said Ms. Delgado, a 53-year-old interior designer. “We followed the mask mandate. Our vaccination rate was so high that we let our guard down. The second Christmas came, we were like, ‘We’re going to party!’” The superspreader concert helped usher in an explosion of Covid-19 cases in Puerto Rico, which until then had been celebrating one of the most successful vaccination campaigns in the United States. The concert was one of a series of business events, company holiday parties and family gatherings that fueled a 4,600 percent increase in cases on the island, a surge that public health officials worry could linger into the New Year; the Puerto Rican holiday season stretches to Three Kings Day on Jan. 6. While the Omicron variant has besieged the entire country, it is especially worrisome in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory already overwhelmed by government bankruptcy, an exodus of health professionals and a fragile health care system. Officials imposed a new wave of tough restrictions on travelers and diners in hopes of staving off the new wave of cases. Rafael Irizarry, a Harvard University statistician who keeps a dashboard of Puerto Rico Covid-19 data, tweeted the daunting facts: A third of all coronavirus cases the island has recorded since the start of the pandemic occurred in the past month. The number of cases per 100,000 residents jumped to 225, from three, in three weeks. In December, the number of hospitalizations doubled — twice. Without the polarizing politics that have plagued the debate over vaccines in other parts of the country, nearly 85 percent of those in Puerto Rico have received at least one vaccine dose, and about 75 percent have gotten both shots. But in the face of a highly contagious new variant, a high vaccination rate is not that meaningful anymore, Mr. Irizarry said. Most in Puerto Rico have passed the six-month limit beyond which the vaccine’s effectiveness begins to wane, yet at least 40 percent have yet to receive their booster shots, health officials said. At one point this week, the daily case count had surpassed 11,000, a very high figure for an island with just 3.2 million inhabitants. The exponential increases have begun to taper off, but case numbers are still climbing, Mr. Irizarry said. “I first noticed something going on on Dec. 13, and I alerted the Department of Health,” he said. “By the 14th and 15th, it was obvious. I called the guy who runs the database and said, ‘Is there some kind of glitch in the database?’” There are currently 317 people hospitalized with Covid-19, more than a quarter of whom are children, according to the island’s Department of Health. That’s about half the number of people who were hospitalized with the illness at this time last year, before so many people were vaccinated. But it is still proving to be a challenge for hospitals. “The problem is, let’s suppose Omicron is half as bad,” Mr. Irizarry said. “If you have eight times more cases, the math doesn’t work out in your favor.” Gov. Pedro R. Pierluisi has ordered lower capacity limits in restaurants. To attend large public events, people now have to be vaccinated and present a negative Covid-19 test. Passengers arriving on domestic flights must show a negative test taken within 48 hours before arrival, regardless of their vaccination status. Similar rules were already in place for international flights. Mass public events, including an important celebration to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the island’s capital, San Juan, have been canceled. “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve,” which ABC had planned to broadcast live from Puerto Rico in front of big crowds, was downgraded to a virtual event. After a few dozen Miss World contestants got sick, the pageant finals in Puerto Rico were canceled. On Thursday, the Scientific Coalition, a group of scientists and health professionals that has been advising the governor, recommended even stricter measures, such as limits on alcohol sales and shorter hours for bars and other establishments. On Friday, the governor followed the recommendation and ordered businesses closed between midnight and 5 a.m. from Jan. 4 until Jan. 18. He also mandated booster shots for restaurant employees and public safety workers. “It’s a message that’s hard to digest when two weeks ago the case numbers here were among the lowest in the world,” said Daniel Colón-Ramos, a Yale University professor who is president of the coalition. The measures are particularly hard in Puerto Rico, he said, where it is hard to overstate the importance of a holiday season that starts at Thanksgiving and lasts until Jan. 6. He described it as “Fourth of July plus the Super Bowl.” “Christmas is a week that Puerto Ricans celebrate their identity,” he said. “They celebrate their family. They celebrate their faith. They celebrate their heritage.” The average age of people who become infected on the island is 33, health officials said. But experts worry that if young people who become infected while attending parties and other events visit elders for New Year’s and Three Kings Day, the number of sick older people is certain to rise. With so many of its young professionals moving in recent years to Florida, Texas and other states, Puerto Rico has a disproportionately high percentage of older adults, many of whom suffer from diabetes, obesity and other ailments that put them at higher risk for coronavirus complications. “We have a health system that is — it’s not a secret — fragile,” said Carlos R. Mellado López, the island's secretary of health. He urged people not to unnecessarily overwhelm testing centers and insisted that Puerto Rico had the tools necessary, such as monoclonal antibody treatments, to combat the crisis. But experts also caution that thousands of medical professionals have left Puerto Rico in recent years in search of higher salaries, which could complicate the island’s ability to attend to large numbers of sick people. The number of doctors on the island has dropped by 5,000 since 2006, and another exodus of primary care doctors is anticipated because they were left out of recent tax incentives designed to keep specialists from leaving, said Víctor M. Ramos Otero, president of the Puerto Rico doctors’ association. “The problem we have is not the beds,” Mr. Ramos said. “The principal issue is the personnel.” José R. López de Victoria, an epidemiologist who helped design coronavirus protections for Puerto Rican basketball teams, said the crisis was still stretching ahead. “From what we are seeing at testing sites, this is not over,” he said. “It’s going to be two more weeks. The expectation is that the case rate will go up.”"

At times, it was overwhelming. Two new rovers landed on Mars, one of them shadowed by an experimental helicopter. Two billionaires launched themselves to the edge of space, and a third billionaire flew himself higher up into orbit. Then William Shatner flew to space, and a fourth billionaire enjoyed a stay aboard the International Space Station. It didn’t end there. China started building a fully operational space station, but relied on a large rocket that reached orbit and then could not be controlled when part of it re-entered the atmosphere. Aboard the International Space Station, a pair of mishaps sent the outpost into unplanned flips in orbit. NASA said goodbye to one asteroid and headed back to Earth carrying samples of it. But NASA also launched a new mission to crash into another asteroid to study defending humanity from a future space-rock strike. Much more happened throughout the year, and 2022 is looking just as busy. You can keep track of these and more big moments by subscribing to The Times Space and Astronomy Calendar at this link. Here’s what may happen in spaceflight in 2022. Sometime this coming year, two rockets that have never been to space — the NASA Space Launch System and the SpaceX Starship — are expected to lift off. They’re both very big and about as different as two rockets can be. The Space Launch System, or S.L.S., is NASA’s interplanetary launch vehicle. It is years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. Built by traditional aerospace contractors, each launch costs about $2 billion and each rocket can be used only once. NASA says its Artemis program can’t get astronauts back to the moon without the giant rocket. Its first test flight, with no people aboard, will lift a capsule called Orion around the moon and back to Earth. The launch, known as Artemis 1, is scheduled for March or April. Starship, by contrast, is being built by SpaceX alone. The fully reusable rocket is central to the vision of Elon Musk, the company’s founder, for sending humans to Mars. A version of Starship is also planned for landing NASA’s astronauts on the lunar surface. The silvery spacecraft’s top half has completed multiple high-altitude test flights that ended in spectacular explosions. It completed a successful landing in one test. Sometime during the year, a Starship prototype with no crew aboard is set to pair with a large reusable booster stage. When the rocket lifts off from a SpaceX launch site in Texas, it will then head to orbit before splashing down off the coast of a Hawaiian island. If 2021 was the year of missions to Mars, the next year could be dominated by trips to the moon. As many as nine missions from an assortment of countries and private companies could try to orbit or land on the moon. Five are sponsored by NASA, and some have clearer prospects of occurring on time than others. In addition to the Orion capsule circling the moon and heading back to Earth, a CubeSat, a miniature satellite, called CAPSTONE could be lifted by Rocket Lab from its New Zealand launch site in March. It would study a lunar orbit that could be used by a future NASA and European moon base. Three more missions headed toward the lunar surface are the work of private companies sponsored under NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. That effort aims to repeat NASA’s success of relying on companies like SpaceX to carry cargo, and later astronauts, to the International Space Station. Intuitive Machines, a Houston company, may be the first company to attempt the trip. The rest of the moon’s robotic visitors in 2022 come from other countries. India may try to redo its unsuccessful 2019 lunar landing in the summer. And Russia says it aims to land on the moon for the first time since 1976. A South Korean moon orbiter could lift off on a SpaceX rocket as soon as August. And a Japanese company, ispace, is working on a landing craft for carrying a variety of cargo, including a rover from the United Arab Emirates, to the moon’s surface. Which of these missions sticks to its schedule is up in the very thin lunar air. Lately, China has kept its word when it says its space program will achieve a certain timeline. So if it says it will finish building the Tiangong space station in orbit in 2022, there’s a good chance that it will. In 2021, China added its Tianhe space module to low-earth orbit and sent two different crews of astronauts to live there. The second crew will come home sometime in 2022, and perhaps by the middle of the year, a laboratory module, Wentian, may launch to orbit and dock with the Tianhe module. Later in the year, a third piece, the Mengtian lab, could complete the Tiangong space station. Both Wentian and Mengtian would launch atop China’s largest rocket, the Long March 5B. Last May, that rocket startled many people when it began an out of control re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere, raising the unlikely but not impossible prospect of causing damage and injury when it landed. Even though the rocket splashed down without incident in the Indian Ocean, it remains unclear whether China will change how it is managed. That means twice more in 2022, Earthlings could play the game of “where will it come down?” NASA has studied numerous asteroids up close, but now it plans to deliberately crash into one. In September, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test is expected to slam into Dimorphos, a small rock that orbits a bigger asteroid, Didymos. Colliding with an asteroid is a potential tactic for planetary defense — if a giant space rock is heading toward Earth, some scientists say that humanity’s best bet is to divert its path so it misses our world. The DART mission would provide data on the effectiveness of this approach. Other asteroids beckon. Psyche, a large object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, appears to be made mostly of iron and other metals. That suggests that in the early history of the solar system, Psyche was the core of an object that failed to form into a planet. A NASA science mission named after the object is planned for launch in the summertime atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. Scheduled for arrival in 2026, the spacecraft would provide scientists their first up-close look at this strange metallic world. "

But rather than trying to correct the situation, the region’s leader, Milorad Dodik, a pugnacious Serb nationalist, instead tried to tear apart the multiethnic fabric of the Bosnian state, a fragile union created in 1995 by American diplomacy out of the wreckage of war. First, Mr. Dodik announced that he was creating his own medicines agency and withdrawing his fief, which covers roughly half of Bosnia’s territory, from the oversight of central government inspectors. Since then, he has threatened to pull out of Bosnia’s multiethnic armed forces and form his own, exclusively Serb army. He also wants out of the state’s tax agency, its intelligence service and its judiciary, vowing to accelerate what he calls the “peaceful dissolution” of a Bosnian state birthed by a peace deal forged in 1995 in Dayton, Ohio. Bosnian investigators have traced the oxygen shipments to a company controlled by one of Mr. Dodik’s close political allies. Some foreign diplomats and rival politicians see his secessionist threats as primarily a means to deflect from allegations of corruption.  But in a region where the shadow of war is everywhere, many Bosnians fear that the country’s peace is under threat. “It will not be peaceful,” warned Sefik Dzaferovic, one of Bosnia’s three presidents, each elected to represent a particular ethnic group. A patchwork of different peoples and religions, Bosnia has long been a tinderbox for larger conflagrations. It was in Sarajevo, Bosnia’s capital, that a teenage Serb nationalist set off World War I by assassinating an Austrian archduke in June 1914, and where the seemingly deranged rants of a Serb psychiatrist, Radovan Karadzic, presaged a three-year spree of bloodletting in the 1990s. Those Balkan wars left roughly 140,000 people dead, drew in NATO warplanes and soldiers and created a rift between Russia and the West that remains today. Now the United States and the European Union, which Bosnia aspires to join, are desperate to stop the new crisis from escalating into conflict, or creating the sort of political instability that Russia could exploit. Russia, which wants to prevent Bosnia from joining the bloc or NATO, is already siding with Mr. Dodik. The frictions in Bosnia are rooted in the 1995 Dayton peace agreement, brokered by the United States. The deal stopped the fighting but created an elaborate and highly dysfunctional political system, with a weak central authority in which different ethnic groups share power. The trio of elected presidents are Mr. Dodik, who represents Serbs, Mr. Dzaferovic, who represents Bosnian Muslims, known as Bosniaks, and Zeljko Komsic, an ethnic Croat. Mr. Dodik has made noises about Serb secession for more than a decade but has never before prompted such a volatile crisis. A report in October by the United Nations’ senior official in Bosnia, Christian Schmidt of Germany, described the situation as “the greatest existential threat” to the country’s survival since the early 1990s. Mr. Schmidt, in a recent interview, played down the risk of a return to bloodletting and said he expected Mr. Dodik to back off his threat to form a separate ethnic Serb army. Among many Bosnians, however, fear is again on the march. When Mr. Schmidt met in mid-December with students at a vocational school in Tuzla, a town where Bosnia’s different ethnic groups have tended to live in rare harmony, he was repeatedly asked what he was doing to prevent a return to war. One student recalled that his parents had lived through the horror of Bosnia’s 1992-95 conflict and asked, “Can you promise us that this won’t happen again?” Another told Mr. Schmidt, “I can’t wait to leave this country where the word ‘war’ is being used more and more.” A teacher displayed a photograph from 1991 that showed a dozen of her male students at the time, all looking relaxed and happy. A quarter of them, she said, were killed in the fighting that began shortly after. In Europe, the response to Mr. Dodik’s provocations has been mixed. Germany and Britain are discussing sanctions. But Hungary’s authoritarian leader, Viktor Orban, recently visited the Serb region’s capital, Banja Luka, to offer support to Mr. Dodik and has vowed to veto any move by the European Union to impose sanctions. Under the Dayton settlement, Bosnia is divided into two largely self-governing parts: Mr. Dodik’s Serb territory, known as Republika Srpska, and a federation controlled by Bosniaks and ethnic Croats. The federation, in turn, is divided into 10 “cantons,” each with its own government. Many Bosniaks view Mr. Dodik’s disruptive actions as proof that Bosnian Serbs should never have been allowed by the Dayton deal to hang on to their own domain, an entity midwifed by men like Mr. Karadzic and the Bosnian Serb former commander Ratko Mladic, who have since been convicted of genocide at The Hague for the Srebrenica massacre in July 1995 and other atrocities. But Mr. Dodik and many of his fellow Serbs still deny war crimes committed by ethnic kin and instead see themselves as victims, as they did during the war. They now claim that Bosnian Serbs are being unfairly picked on, after a decision in July by Mr. Schmidt’s predecessor as U.N. envoy that outlawed the denial of genocide. The ban applies to all ethnic groups, but many Bosnian Serbs see it as targeted at them. Mirko Sarovic, the leader of a Serb political party opposed to Mr. Dodik, denounced the ban as a “huge mistake.” In an interview, he said it had emboldened belligerent nationalists, bolstered Mr. Dodik’s previously waning public support and encouraged him to embark on a “reckless adventure” that “has no chance of succeeding and has huge potential to provoke conflict.” Mr. Dodik is a onetime American protégé whom the Clinton administration praised in 1998 as a “breath of fresh air.” Now, President Biden’s special envoy to the region, Gabriel Escobar, calls him a menace who “stabs the heart, strikes the heart of Dayton.” In October, Mr. Dodik warned that Serbs in Bosnia would “defend ourselves with our forces if necessary” and said that “our friends” — namely Russia and nearby Serbia — could be counted on to repel any effort to rein him in by the NATO alliance. Serbia, however, has shown no interest in repeating its role in the 1990s, when it sent weapons and paramilitary gangs to support ethnic kin in Bosnia. And how much Russia really supports Mr. Dodik is unclear. Last month, he returned from a visit to Moscow claiming that he had received pledges of support during a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin. But the Kremlin, which usually announces meetings well in advance, waited days before confirming it had happened. Then it put the Serb leader in his place, saying that Mr. Putin’s “main event” that day had been a “coal conference,” not Mr. Dodik. Yet the Kremlin clearly delights in seeing Bosnia in disarray, given that the United States and Europe once championed it as a showcase of successful nation-building. For years, Mr. Putin has warned the formerly communist lands of Eastern Europe that Western promises of peace and prosperity are hollow. The big question is whether Mr. Dodik’s threats are real or are mostly political theater to rally his nationalist base ahead of elections in October. “He probably doesn’t really know himself where this all leads,” said Mr. Schmidt, the U.N. envoy, adding that he was on a “dangerous and slippery road.” Mr. Dodik has indicated in private, diplomats say, that his primary interest is keeping state prosecutors out of his domain so as to eliminate the risk that credible reports of rampant corruption ever get seriously investigated — including the scandal over industrial oxygen for Covid patients. The Bosnian health investigator traced those shipments to a company based in Mr. Dodik’s hometown, Laktasi, which is controlled by his Serb region’s former interior minister.  “It is all a political game, and politics in Bosnia is just a smoke screen to cover up crime,” Aleksandar Zolak, the medicines agency’s chief, said in an interview. “Dodik knows that he can only be exposed by independent institutions and people who tell the truth, so is doing everything he can to destroy them.” Mr. Dodik, though, has used the moment to grind the central government to a halt. The three presidents are supposed to meet every two weeks to sign off on key proposals. But they have not met since October, when Mr. Dodik showed up with an accordion and started singing Serb folk songs in his office with a group of supporters. Since then, he has rejected or ignored all proposals put before him and his fellow presidents. “Dodik survives on conflict,” said Branislav Borenovic, a Serb opposition party leader. “He hates stability because he then has to explain why we are living like we do,” he said, adding that Mr. Dodik “plays on the emotions of his people and doesn’t care about the consequences.” Even if Mr. Dodik is just playing politics, Mr. Borenovic said, his antics are stirring passions to a dangerous pitch: “In a country of three million people, you can always find a few idiots to light the fire.”"

Amber Santos stood beside the trash bins they had carried inside the car, which reeked of food leftovers from Ten 3, a restaurant at the top of Sandia Peak near Albuquerque. Almost home, she thought as she felt the tramway system, which shuttles people to the restaurant 10,300 feet above sea level, start to move. Twenty people were in one car, and one person was in another — 19 employees of Ten 3 and two employees of the tramway system — who were headed home to celebrate 2022. Then, near the second tower of the tramway, the cars stopped. At 10 p.m., nothing. At 11 p.m., still no movement. “Something’s not right,” Ms. Santos recalled telling her colleagues. Finally, the countdown until 2022 had, for those stranded, become a countdown until their rescue. It would take more than 12 hours. As temperatures dipped into the mid-20s, the passengers resorted to rationing Life Savers gummies and six bottles of water as they spent the first few hours of 2022 waiting for rescue crews to arrive. By Saturday afternoon, all of the stranded passengers had been rescued. No one was injured, officials said. Spencer Moreland, an incident commander for New Mexico Search and Rescue, which provided about 30 volunteers who helped with the rescue, got a call from the New Mexico State Police at 3 a.m. He was on the scene by 4 a.m., and an hour later, rescuers had begun the more than four-hour hike up the steep terrain in a snowstorm. Rescuers had to get to a tower, climb to the tram and set up a rope system to lower people to safety, he said. From there, they hiked with the passengers about 100 yards to a landing site where a helicopter whisked them away a few at a time. Rescuers battled treacherous conditions, said Larry Koren, the pilot who flew the stranded to safety by landing his helicopter on a narrow ridge. Mr. Koren, who is also the undersheriff for the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office, said members of the sheriff’s office, along with other local officials, had trained with the tramway operator for just such a situation. Such a rescue was one that they had considered but never executed, he said, adding, “And we never expected it would be for 21 people in a snowstorm.” Michael Donovan, general manager of Sandia Peak Aerial Tramway, said that wind and ice had caused an emergency cable to cross over another cable, preventing the tram cars from reaching their destination. He said rescuers were lucky that visibility had improved, allowing for a helicopter rescue. Otherwise, the stranded crew members might have had to hike to safety, a trek they were not equipped for. “Some of the cooks had Crocs on,” he said. At first, being trapped in a tram car for New Year’s Eve had been welcomed as a funny, yet dangerous, adventure, Ms. Santos said. Her Instagram videos show her and the others yelling “Happy New Year!” at midnight. But then the temperature began to drop. At 12:57 a.m., it was 35 degrees. The passengers retrieved emergency blankets stored in the car and broke out hard pretzels and Life Savers gummies from their backpacks.  “Everyone’s quiet,” said Ms. Santos, 31. “It’s dark. It’s freezing. We’re literally freezing or shivering because the small safety blankets don’t retain any heat.” She added, “You just start thinking, ‘Is this how I’m going to die, in a tiny box with my co-workers?’” The wind swayed the car like a playground swing. At 3:49 a.m., they were bunched together, mostly silent, but still supportive of one another, Ms. Santos said. It was 24 degrees, and she continued to shiver, unable to sleep. She tried to think positive thoughts: At least the car had a built-in toilet. And at least they could communicate with the tramway system workers through a speaker on the car. The workers told them help was on the way. But by 4 a.m., she believed she was going to die, she said. “You just felt hopeless,” Ms. Santos said. “You’re cold. You’re sad. You just want to be at home on New Year’s with your friends, doing what other people do.” When rescue crews finally arrived, she immediately reached for a blanket and a water bottle. After rappelling to the ground, which she said was “actually very exciting,” she got on the helicopter, was checked by medical workers and then walked to her car. She opened up Instagram one more time and recorded a message. “I literally have no words for today,” she said. “I’m literally out of words. This has been horrible.”"

Footage of the person climbing a tall barbed-wire fence — the southernmost of multiple fences in the 2.5-mile-wide buffer zone separating the Koreas — was captured ​by South Korean cameras at 6:40 p.m. Saturday, and sensors on the fence triggered an alarm, the military said in a briefing to the news media. Nevertheless, the breach went unnoticed until 9:20 p.m., when the military spotted the person in the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, as it is commonly known. At 10:40 p.m., the person crossed the military demarcation line, the border within the DMZ, putting him or her on North Korean soil, the military said. It was only afterward that the military discovered the evidence of the initial fence crossing. There was no immediate public response from North Korea. South Korea said it had notified the North’s military about the crossing but had yet to receive a reply. The South’s military said it was still trying to determine who the border-crosser was — whether it was a South Korean citizen, a North Korean spy or an unhappy defector going home, or some other possibility. No South Korean soldiers were missing from their units along the eastern part of the border in Gangwon Province, where the breach occurred, the military said. Defections across the DMZ are rare and dangerous. The two Koreas have technically been at war for decades, the Korean War having been halted in 1953 with a truce, not a peace treaty. ​The DMZ is bristling with fences, sensors, minefields, ​sentry posts and armed patrols​, and nearly two million troops are ready for battle on both sides​. At night, the south​ern​ edge of the buffer zone is flooded with high-powered lights. Whenever a breach occurs and border guards fail to apprehend a would-be crosser, alarms are raised on both sides of the border​. ​ ​In 2017, ​North Korean troops unleashed a hail of ​bullets in a failed effort to stop a fellow soldier ​who defected to the South by dashing through Panmunjom, ​the ​so-called truce village that straddles the border. Crossings from south to north are even rarer. ​When a North Korean defector who had been living in the South fled back to his hometown in the North by swimming across a ​river in 2020, North Korea locked down the entire town ​for fear he might have brought in the coronavirus. Later that year, North Korea caused outrage in​ the​ South when its troops shot and killed a South Korean ​fisheries official in waters near the border. The South, which said the official had been trying to defect, accused the North Koreans of burning his body at sea. The North admitted killing him, but said that its soldiers could not find the body and had burned his floating device only for disease-control purposes. ​ North Korean border guards were reported to be under shoot-to-kill orders to prevent the coronavirus from being brought into the country. Some 33,800 North Koreans have defected to the South since famine struck the​ North in the 1990s, but few crossed the border directly. Almost all of them ​first ​fled ​to China, eventually getting to South Korea by way of a third country in Southeast Asia. The eastern part of the border, snaking through rugged mountains, has been the most vulnerable to security breaches. In 2012, a defecting North Korean soldier not only scaled barbed-wire border fences without being detected, but also had to knock on the doors of South Korean barracks to get attention. ​ After that embarrassment, the South Korean military ​installed more surveillance gear, including the electronic sensors, on the border. But crossings in the east continued. In November​ 2020​, another North Korean defector, a former gymnast​, crawled over the southernmost fence and was not captured until a day later, when he was found a half-mile farther south after an extensive manhunt. In February, a defector in a wet suit swam down the eastern coast, going undetected until he came ashore​ in the South and was found walking along a road. Such lapses have ruined the careers of military commanders overnight. ​For that reason, officers assigned to the eastern part of the border often refer to the posting as a “graveyard shift.”"

Moderates would beg to differ. They see Ms. Abrams as an ally for rejecting left-wing policies that center-left Democrats have spurned, like “Medicare for all,” the Green New Deal to combat climate change and the defunding of law enforcement in response to police violence. “I don’t know that anybody in the party can say, ‘She’s one of us,’” said Matt Bennett, a founder of Third Way, the center-left group. “We can’t pretend she’s a moderate,” he added. “But the progressives can’t say she’s a progressive and not a moderate. We’re both kind of right.” The question of how to define Ms. Abrams, 48, the presumptive Democratic standard-bearer in one of the most high-profile races of 2022, takes on new urgency amid the current landscape of the party. Moderates and progressives sparred in Washington throughout 2021, frustrating a White House struggling to achieve consensus on its priorities and continuing an ideological debate that has raged in the party for years. There is also thirst for new blood across the party, considering the advanced ages of President Biden, congressional leaders, and leading progressives like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. On a local level, whether Ms. Abrams maintains credibility with both Democratic wings may determine how well she can withstand Republican attacks. Those close to her campaign say they expect an extremely close race, and that the key is holding the suburban moderates who supported her in 2018 while exciting enough of the new Georgia voters who have registered since that election. Republicans in Georgia — who await Ms. Abrams in the general election — are eager to denounce her as a left-wing radical out of place in a state that was a G.O.P. stronghold until it narrowly tipped into the Democratic column in 2020. Gov. Brian Kemp, who faces a fierce primary challenge in May from former Senator David Perdue, who has the support of former President Donald J. Trump, has released five digital advertisements attacking Ms. Abrams since she announced her campaign on Dec. 1. “Stacey Abrams’ far left agenda has no place in Georgia,” one warns ominously. But a review of Ms. Abrams’s policy statements and television advertisements, and interviews with political figures who have known her for years, reveal a leader who has carefully calibrated her positions, making a point to avoid drifting into one Democratic lane or another. Her allies say the fluidity is an asset, and highlights how policy is only one way that voters choose which candidate to rally behind. Racial representation and the unique political context of the American South are also factors in whether a candidate can credibly claim progressive bona fides, they argue. Steve Phillips, an early supporter and prominent progressive Democratic donor, said Ms. Abrams’s political strategy was progressive, even if her policy positions were more moderate. “It’s hard for white progressives to be too critical of someone who is so strongly and fiercely unapologetically Black and female,” he said. “Her authenticity comes from the sectors that are the core parts of the progressive base.” Ms. Abrams’s approach does carry risks. In the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race, several candidates who sought to straddle the line between moderate and progressive policies lost the trust of significant numbers of voters in both camps, as activists pushed for firm commitments on issues like health care, climate change, expanding the Supreme Court and reparations for descendants of enslaved people. At times, Ms. Abrams has used her perch to speak out against progressive causes and defend the Democratic establishment. She said attempts to defund police departments after the murder of George Floyd were creating a “false choice” and said departments should be reformed instead. On health care, she has focused on expanding Medicaid rather than supporting a single-payer system. And in 2020, a think tank founded by Ms. Abrams released a climate plan focused on the South that embraced efforts to incentivize renewable energy but stopped short of the ambitious goals pushed by progressive activists and lawmakers like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. But Ben Jealous, a former Democratic candidate for governor of Maryland who leads the progressive group People for the American Way, said progressives should trust Ms. Abrams just the same. “The Green New Deal is designed for the industrialized unionized North,” he said. “And you’ve got to translate that into Southern.” He added, “She does that.” Several of Ms. Abrams’s allies welcomed an examination of her policy record, arguing that characterizing her as a progressive only fueled Republican attacks. Ms. Abrams declined to be interviewed for this article. Asked how she defined herself ideologically, a spokesman, Seth Bringman, said she “defines herself by her values and her ability to deliver results for the common good by navigating disparate groups and ideologies.” “She’s unwavering in her support for unions, and she worked with anti-union corporations to stop discrimination against the L.G.B.T.Q. community,” he added. “She’s unapologetically pro-choice, and she coordinated with anti-choice legislators to pass criminal justice reform. She’s a capitalist who supports regulation and believes we can fight poverty while praising success.” Such pragmatism has encouraged some moderates — including Georgians who served with Ms. Abrams in the State Capitol — to compare her to other center-left national figures who had credibility among the grass-roots base, like Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Mr. Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, said Ms. Abrams had demonstrated that she “wasn’t going to be pushed around by anybody in the party, from the center or from the left.” He added, “That independence has made her a very viable candidate.” Carolyn Hugley, a Georgia state representative who has known Ms. Abrams since 2011, said she had always sought to be seen as a “doer” and an organizer. As minority leader, Ms. Abrams, a budget wonk, aligned with Tea Party members and some religious groups to oppose a Republican tax reform bill. “If you had asked me 10 years ago if voting rights was what she was going to be known for, I would probably say no,” Ms. Hugley said.  In Georgia, Ms. Abrams became known for her willingness to work with anyone, even if it led to a backlash. In 2011, she lent bipartisan credibility to an effort by Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, to restructure the state’s scholarship program for low-income students. Several Democrats criticized her decision to stand with him at a news conference, saying it gave a gift to an incumbent who had sought to shrink the program and was an example of Ms. Abrams’s putting her own ambitions above the party’s long-term interests. “It got misinterpreted,” said DuBose Porter, a former chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party. “But the real Stacey Abrams will always come through. And that real Stacey Abrams is somebody that cares about the issues.” Mr. Jealous, of People for the American Way, said he recalled Ms. Abrams encouraging him to reach out to Newt Gingrich, the Georgia Republican and former House speaker, to build cross-aisle support for reforming the state’s prisons. This campaign cycle, even Ms. Abrams’s supporters concede that the intensifying spotlight could test her political talent anew. The prospect that she could become the first Black woman in the country to be elected governor has already renewed whispers about her possible presidential ambitions. Unlike in 2018, when Ms. Abrams was not yet a national figure, or during Mr. Biden’s vice-presidential search, in which she was considered a long shot, she enters the 2022 race as a marquee name on the Democratic roster — and a prime target for Republicans. The Virginia governor’s race offered a preview of what Ms. Abrams could face, with Democrats on the defensive and Republicans pummeling them over Mr. Biden’s vaccine mandates, how schools teach about racism and the removal of Confederate statues. Ms. Abrams rallied Virginia Democrats behind the Democratic candidate, former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, in the days before the election — a testament to her standing in the party. By contrast, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said she and other progressives were told to stay away. When announcing her candidacy in December, Ms. Abrams stuck to local themes, highlighting her work during the pandemic and her efforts to expand Medicaid access in Georgia. In the 2018 governor’s race, she did not run an ad about race or voting rights, according to a list her aides provided. Last month, during an online campaign event with more than 350 supporters on the theme of “One Georgia,” Ms. Abrams steered clear of policy specifics and hot-button cultural conversations, focusing instead on issues like the coronavirus and education — and on her Republican opponents. “When people ask what’s the biggest difference between me and the current governor, it’s that I like Georgians,” Ms. Abrams said. “I like all of them. The ones who agree with me and the ones who do not.” As much as Democrats may want to label her, Mr. Jealous advised against it, citing two lessons he learned about Ms. Abrams when they first met as 19-year-old college activists. The first: She would not be pushed to go anywhere she was not comfortable. The second: “Never speak after her,” he said. Mr. Phillips, the Democratic donor, said he was confident that the war between moderates and progressives would not affect Ms. Abrams in 2022. When, then, would it matter? “If and when she runs for president,” he said."
251,The New York Times,nytimes,As Americans return to work and school on Monday we asked about their concerns as coronavirus cases skyrocket.,https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnyti.ms%2F3HsON47%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1HXWWZl3pGkHaU_bsyK_QLm6ORcuoz688rKbWTdltk8d_mjvrQGphaSaU&h=AT2w1227-ixLL-X5Whw0wmhNQsq7p7skhWDTaQSZq2UqsoMBB8_iXN92jegtkQb0SE-Ngrxx7flxL4h5dGTpISfm-acBy-cMW4u09kxLCjHeF10Bchd_HQ6PoRZz71KzqjjORAPzeUhAeLJwrlWi&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT1XNLvk0MOuYzmVFlif9Crw3ED3KXGCJNYg40ltzgSUM1qiBPQiNmIOOjySHf_IES7e_lfHuUH4u8D-qhp-4iAf_MIrSyx-THCK9QRazorqzt-HSmaodOJ9uaP9R5nLFcQuPJIEmeiIraHZ4zsrF3t29kw7J5ij6kE5ToeBELTjBTQg,3d,"Mayor Eric Adams of New York said on Sunday, his second day in office, that city workers might be required to get Covid vaccine booster shots. City employees are already required to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, but with new cases setting daily records, Mr. Adams, speaking on ABC’s “This Week,” said the city’s “next move and decision” would be to “examine the numbers” and decide if a booster mandate is needed for municipal workers, such as teachers and police officers. “If we feel we have to get to the place of making that mandatory, we’re willing to do that, but we’re encouraging them to do that now,” Mr. Adams told the host, George Stephanopoulos. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has shown it can evade vaccines, though studies indicate Moderna and Pfizer boosters are likely to offer substantial protection from the variant. Its rapid spread across the country has led some experts to call for a redefinition of what it means to be fully vaccinated, and corporations, schools, governments and even sports leagues are weighing whether to require booster shots. Last week, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York announced that nearly 600,000 public university students will soon be required to get vaccination booster shots. Big school districts that plan to reopen Monday are also expanding testing. With teachers and nearly one million students returning to New York City’s public schools, Mr. Adams said at an appearance in Harlem that he thought “testing should be mandatory” for city schools, but said that the decision belonged to the state. “It’s so important, it would give us a lot of power to determine who’s exposed,” said Mr. Adams, who stopped short of calling for mandatory vaccinations for schoolchildren. “A mandatory vaccination, I think we should scale up to that,” he said. “I don’t think we’re at that point now where it needs to be mandatory, but I would love to have mandatory testing right now.” The city is launching a ramped-up testing program to allow students who test negative for the coronavirus and do not have symptoms to remain in school. Instead of delaying the start of in-person school and pivoting to remote learning, the city will double the amount of random surveillance testing it conducts, in hopes of detecting more infections while mitigating disruptions. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III has tested positive for the coronavirus, he announced. In a statement posted to his Twitter account Sunday evening, Mr. Austin said he had tested positive for the virus that morning, after experiencing symptoms while at home on leave. “My symptoms are mild, and I am following my physician’s directions,” Mr. Austin said, adding that he planned to quarantine at home for the next five days while virtually attending key meetings and discussions “to the degree possible.” “I will retain all authorities,” he said, adding that Kathleen Hicks, the deputy secretary of defense, would represent him as appropriate in other matters. In sharing his diagnosis, the defense secretary stressed that his fully vaccinated status — including a booster received in early October — was to thank for his mild symptoms. “I am grateful,” Mr. Austin said, adding that vaccines remained a requirement for the military. He added: “The vaccines work.” President Biden and other White House staff have been informed of Mr. Austin’s diagnosis, and contact tracing was being conducted, he added, noting that his last meeting with the president had been more than a week prior, and that he had received a negative test result for the virus that morning. “I have not been in the Pentagon since Thursday, where I met briefly & only with a few staff,” Mr. Austin said. “We were properly masked & socially distanced throughout.” JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announced on Sunday that Israel would offer a fourth Covid vaccine shot to people age 60 and over, as well as to medical workers, making it the first country to plan for an additional booster so broadly as it braces for a surge of infections from the Omicron variant. “The Omicron wave is here,” Mr. Bennett said in a televised news conference. He said the decision to introduce a fourth dose of vaccine for vulnerable people who had their last shot at least four months ago would provide Israel with “a new layer of protection.” The Ministry of Health said it had approved the move in light of rising morbidity and the risk to older people. Israel is reporting about 5,000 new daily cases, its highest figure since September. Mr. Bennett said that the peak of the Omicron wave, expected in the coming weeks, could bring up to 50,000 new cases per day. The prime minister’s office said the new boosters would start on Monday. But health ministry officials did not immediately present new data to back the decision to go ahead with a little-tested fourth dose on such a wide scale. In recent days, the ministry first approved a fourth dose for people with weakened immune systems and then for the residents and staff of nursing homes. But health officials said they wanted to review more data from abroad about Omicron and about the value of added boosters before approving a fourth dose for the older population in general. Israeli experts said it was not immediately clear what the new decision was based on. Some experts have warned that it may be premature, and some have voiced concerns that a fourth shot in less than a year could actually weaken immunity. But a panel of medical experts advising the Israeli government has recommended giving a fourth shot to those 60 and older, pointing to waning immunity in that age group, which was the first to receive the third shot starting in August. Israel was a leader in rolling out the first round of Covid vaccinations and later in giving booster shots, so its results have been closely watched by the rest of the world. Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland said Sunday that the next few weeks could be one of the worst periods of the coronavirus epidemic yet, and that the state was working against staffing shortages in “overflowing” hospitals. “We believe that the next four to six weeks are really going to be a terrible point in this crisis, and it’s potentially going to be the worst part of the whole two-year fight,” Mr. Hogan said on the CNN program “State of the Union.” Despite having one of the highest vaccination rates in the nation, hospitals were filled with unvaccinated patients, he said. “We’re going to take and continue to take every action we possibly can to help our hospitals, our nursing homes and to keep people safe,” he said. One of the challenges for the weeks ahead will be maintaining staffing in medical facilities. Many doctors and nurses have been coming down with Covid, he said, and were also exhausted. “You can’t really manufacture doctors and nurses that don’t exist, and frankly, these heroes on the front line that have been working so hard for two years, there’s fatigue,” Mr. Hogan said. To mitigate the crisis, the state put emergency funding into hospitals and nursing homes and sped up the graduations of nursing students, amid other measures. Maryland’s hospitals, like those in many other states, are reaching capacity. The state reported a rolling average of more than 8,800 new cases a day on Jan. 1, an increase of more than 560 percent over the last two weeks, according to a New York Times database. Hospitalizations are up by more than 60 percent to an average of nearly 2,400. It’s unclear how many hospitalizations are patients infected with Omicron versus the Delta variant, which is thought to be significantly more virulent. According to the C.D.C., about 58 percent of cases in Maryland and nearby states are currently Omicron. The Maryland Hospital Association said that the number of hospital patients surpassed the state’s Covid peak from last winter. The chief medical officer at the Anne Arundel Medical Center in Annapolis told MSNBC that the state was “at a tipping point,” and that there were no beds left open. Mr. Hogan also talked about his recent breakthrough case of the coronavirus. “Because I had that protection,” Mr. Hogan said of the vaccine, “I had sort of a bad cold. What we’re faced with now — unfortunately, this new omicron variant is impacting just about everyone, including many people who are fully protected, but it’s keeping them out of the hospital and that’s the thing we have to keep in mind.” Americans should focus less on the skyrocketing number of coronavirus infections and more on the number of hospitalizations and deaths, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.” Over the past week, an average of more than 401,200 cases has been reported each day in the United States, tripling from two weeks ago and the first time the number has topped 400,000, according to a New York Times database (new case numbers are slightly depressed because fewer states are reporting after the New Year’s holiday). Hospitalizations were by comparison up 33 percent, however, to 92,300, while deaths had dropped 4 percent to an average of 1,249 daily. Dr. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, noted that many new infections, especially in people who are vaccinated and boosted, result in no symptoms or mild symptoms, making the absolute number of cases less important than they were for previous versions of the virus. “As you get further on and the infections become less severe, it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations as opposed to the total number of cases,” Dr. Fauci said. That advice is in keeping with what many epidemiologists have said all along. Despite the daily drumbeat of case counts, the number of positive tests has never been a perfect indicator of the course of the epidemic. The number of tests has exploded because the Omicron variant seems to be much more contagious than Delta or other earlier variants and more people are getting tested for mild symptoms. What’s more, the official numbers are almost certainly an undercount, because many people are testing positive on rapid at-home tests or carrying the virus without any symptoms. Yet, as Dr. Fauci told Mr. Stephanopoulos, the concern is not so much the mild or asymptomatic cases being picked up with widespread testing as it is the number of people with severe or fatal infections. “The real bottom line that you want to be concerned about,” he said, “is are we getting protected by the vaccines from severe disease leading to hospitalization?” So far, vaccines and boosters appear to be providing that protection. But the unvaccinated remain at risk. “I’m still very concerned about the tens of millions of people who are not vaccinated at all because even though many of them are going to get asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, a fair number of them are going to get severe disease,” Dr. Fauci said. Also, even if Omicron is milder, as most evidence suggests, a higher caseload means more health care workers who can’t work because they test positive as well as more chances that people could get sick enough to require medical care. “We have got to be careful about that, because, even if you have a less of a percentage of severity, when you have multi-multi-multi-fold more people getting infected, the net amount is you’re still going to get a lot of people that are going to be needing hospitalization,” he said.  Dr. Fauci also said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be reconsidering its guidelines for people who test positive for the coronavirus. The guidelines as of now do not require a negative test before people venture out after five days of isolation. But Dr. Fauci suggested that the agency may soon revise these guidelines to include testing. “I think we’re going to be hearing more about that in the next day or so from the C.D.C.,” he said. A federal judge in Louisiana has blocked for now the White House’s requirement that all workers in the Head Start early education program be vaccinated. The preliminary injunction, issued Saturday by U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty, also halts a mask requirement for students aged two or older who are in close contact with other people or indoors. The ruling was brought to Judge Doughty by 24 states that sued Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. Head Start is a federal program for young children from low-income families that offers early educational and child development support services. In September, President Biden released his “Path out of the Pandemic” six-part Covid action plan, which called for teachers and staff of Head Start and Early Head Start programs to be fully vaccinated against Covid by the end of January. Staff of schools operated by the Department of Defense and Bureau of Indian Education were also required to be vaccinated. “These schools and programs collectively serve more than 1 million children each year and employ nearly 300,000 staff,” the president’s plan read. Judge Doughty cited a violation of separation of powers in his ruling. “The issue in this case is not whether individuals should take the Covid-19 vaccine, but whether federal agencies can mandate individuals to take a vaccine or be fired,” he wrote. “If the executive branch is allowed to usurp the power of the legislative branch to make laws, then this country is no longer a democracy — it is a monarchy.” It wasn’t clear if the White House would fight the injunction, but the Supreme Court has recently upheld vaccine mandates for New York health care workers, Indiana University and air travel. In November, Judge Doughty, who was nominated to the court in 2017 by then-President Donald Trump, also blocked President Biden’s national vaccine mandate for health care workers. The Biden administration appealed that decision. White House officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Many Republican lawmakers, including the attorneys general of Arizona and Alabama, praised the injunction. In a startling illustration of the financial damage a resurgent pandemic is causing on Broadway, the producer of a new musical adaptation of “Mrs. Doubtfire” has decided to close down his show for nine weeks, saying he sees no other way to save the production. Kevin McCollum, a veteran Broadway producer whose previous credits include “Rent” and “Avenue Q,” said he would close the musical comedy beginning Jan. 10, with a plan to reopen on March 14. The move will cost 115 people their jobs for that period; McCollum said he is committed to rehiring those who want to return. “My job is to protect the jobs long-term of those who are working on ‘Mrs. Doubtfire,’ and this is the best way I can do that today,” he said in an interview. “I can’t just sit idly by when there’s a solution, albeit unprecedented and painful. I can’t guarantee anything, but at this moment this is the most prudent thing I can do with the tools I have.” McCollum said that if he does not attempt the hiatus, the show would run out of money and be forced to close within three weeks. And there is plenty of reason to believe that is not hyperbole: Five Broadway shows in December decided to close earlier than anticipated, including the musicals “Ain’t Too Proud,” “Diana,” “Jagged Little Pill” and “Waitress,” as well as the play “Thoughts of a Colored Man.” “Mrs. Doubtfire,” like all Broadway shows, has been battered by the coronavirus pandemic. The production, in development for years and capitalized for $17 million, had gotten through just three preview performances in March 2020 when Broadway shut down; it was closed for 19 months before resuming previews in October, and then opened in December, bolstered by a nearly $10 million grant from the Small Business Administration. Goldman Sachs told its U.S. employees on Sunday to work from home for the first two weeks of the year, joining Wall Street competitors that had already given similar instructions as coronavirus cases have surged. Employees who are able to work remotely should do so until Jan. 18 in response to rising infection rates, the investment bank said in an email to employees. The shift in policy came after the Wall Street firm announced new booster and testing requirements last week, but, unlike many of its peers, did not encourage staff to work from home. Goldman called most workers back to the office in June, and its chief executive, David M. Solomon, is a strong proponent of working in the office. The bank has 43,000 employees, many of whom are based in its Manhattan headquarters. New York State recorded over 85,000 new coronavirus cases on the last day of 2021, the highest one-day total in the state since the pandemic began. The Omicron variant has prompted big Wall Street companies, which have been eager to bring back workers, to delay those plans. Before the latest surge, office attendance had remained stubbornly low as bankers staged a quiet revolt: parents are still concerned about passing the virus to their children, suburban dwellers eschew long commutes and many workers have shown that they are able to be productive while working from home. As workers trickle back, the financial industry, which employs 332,100 people in New York City, may also have to ramp up its vaccine efforts. Eric Adams, who was sworn in as mayor of New York City early Saturday, said he would maintain his predecessor’s private-sector mandate. Goldman currently requires people entering its buildings to be inoculated, and starting on Feb. 1, it will require a booster for all employees eligible to receive one. It had already announced that starting Jan. 10, staff coming into the office would be tested for the virus twice a week at on-site testing centers, increasing from a current requirement of once a week. JPMorgan Chase gave staff flexibility to work from home in the first two weeks of the year, but wants them to return to in-office schedules no later than Feb. 1, according to a memo sent to employees last week. The bank may also amend its policy on vaccinations, which it has not required so far. “Government-issued vaccine mandates may likely make it difficult or impossible for us to continue to employ unvaccinated employees, so getting the vaccine is very important,” the memo said. The bank may soon also require a booster shot for people entering its buildings. Citigroup expanded remote working for its U.S. employees. “We are asking that you work from home for the first few weeks of the new year if you are able to do so,” the bank said in a memo to staff on Thursday. “We will continue to monitor the data and provide an update in January on when we expect to be back in the office.” That guidance applied to employees in more than 30 offices around the country who had been called back since September. Employees in New York City and New Jersey were already given the option to work from home in the final weeks of the year. Wells Fargo has postponed its return to the office, while corporate employees at Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank were given more leeway to work remotely over the holidays. In April of 2020, federal scientists reported the first glimmer of hope against the new coronavirus: a large clinical trial had found that an antiviral drug, remdesivir, shortened recovery time in hospitalized patients from 15 to 11 days. The drug was authorized a few months later and has also been cleared in more than 50 other countries. But remdesivir’s use has been limited to hospitalized patients, and its intravenous administration has been an obstacle. Two new studies, published in late December, indicate that both issues could be improved in the not-too-distant future. One found that infused remdesivir appears to be markedly effective when given earlier in the course of illness, before a patient is hospitalized. And a study in monkeys suggests that inhaled remdesivir could eventually replace infusions. The study of remdesivir treatment in patients who were not hospitalized, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, involved 592 patients at risk for severe disease who had not been hospitalized. Half received a three-day course of remdesivir and the others got a placebo. Remdesivir greatly reduced patients’ chances of hospitalization or death: 5 of 279 patients, or 1.7 percent who received remdesivir were hospitalized by day 28 of their infection, compared with 18 of 283, or 6.5 percent, who got a placebo. What’s more, because all variants of the virus carry the particular enzyme that remdesivir blocks, the drug should work against Omicron or any other new variant that happens to emerge. The National Institutes of Health this week updated its treatment guidelines to recommend remdesivir to nonhospitalized patients. A separate study, supported by Gilead Sciences, the maker of remdesivir, tested an inhaled version of the drug on African green monkeys. As reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine, the researchers used a 20-fold lower dose of the inhaled drug than what is used in an intravenous infusion. Yet that low dose resulted in a 53 percent higher concentration of the drug in the animals’ lungs. The researchers also reported that inhaled remdesivir was as effective as the intravenous version in reducing the amount of virus in the animals’ lungs. Much more research is needed before the inhaled version of the drug could be used in people. But if remdesivir could eventually be inhaled at home, the hope is that it could provide a more convenient way for patients at high risk to be protected from severe disease. Twitter on Sunday permanently suspended the personal account of Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican of Georgia, after the company said she had violated its Covid-19 misinformation policies. Twitter said that Ms. Greene had a fifth “strike,” which meant that her account will not be restored. The company had issued her a fourth strike in August after she falsely posted that the vaccines were “failing.” Ms. Greene was given a third strike less than a month before that when she had tweeted that Covid-19 was not dangerous for people unless they were obese or over age 65, and said vaccines should not be required. Ms. Greene’s official Congressional account, @RepMTG, remains active because tweets from that account did not violate the service’s rules. “We’ve been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy,” Katie Rosborough, a Twitter spokeswoman, said in a statement. Ms. Greene did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Her suspension comes as coronavirus cases have surged again in the United States from the highly infectious Omicron variant. Twitter has long banned users from sharing misinformation about the coronavirus that could lead to harm. In March, the company introduced a policy that explained the penalties for sharing lies about the virus and vaccines. People who violate that policy are subject to escalating punishments known as strikes and could face a permanent ban if they repeatedly share misinformation about the virus. England is putting air purifiers in classrooms and strongly encouraging students to wear masks as schools prepare to reopen with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus driving a record surge of cases. The classroom is “the very best place for children,” Britain’s education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said Sunday in a statement, adding that officials were doing “everything in our power to minimize disruption.” The recommendation for students in seventh grade and above — which comes on top of restrictions imposed in Britain last month, including mandatory face masks in most public indoor venues — will be in place until Jan. 26. The government also said it would install thousands of air-cleaning units in schools and colleges to help improve ventilation. The guidance comes as European countries have been particularly hard-hit by Omicron infections over the holiday period. Last week, Britain reported a daily average of 172,738 new cases, according to a New York Times database, the highest peak since the pandemic began. The sharp increase in case numbers has prompted other nations to impose rules on travelers to and from the country. The Kuwaiti Embassy to the United Kingdom, for example, advised its citizens in Britain on Sunday to return home over fears of new restrictions, according to the country’s official state news agency. France has also introduced new measures to fight the Omicron surge. In a decree issued on Saturday, the French government made face coverings compulsory in indoor public places for everyone age 6 and over. The country has recorded more than 200,000 new infections for four consecutive days. Last week, in an effort to curb the spread of the virus, cities like Lyon and Paris made it compulsory to wear masks outdoors, as well. In other global news: On various occasions during the fall, I tried and failed to make a dinner reservation at Gage & Tollner, the historic restaurant on the Fulton Mall in Brooklyn that reopened during the spring to much fanfare, after 17 years. Boosted before Thanksgiving and having recovered from a recent breakthrough Covid infection, I tried again this week in a new spirit of invincibility. Logging on to the restaurant’s website and also to Resy, I clicked on every night in January that the restaurant was open, in search of a table for two. This proved fruitless, unless I elected to eat at the bar on Sunday the 23rd at 10 o’clock, at which point I’d be replaying crucial scenes in a prestige cable drama to which I had fallen asleep. Shaking my head in disbelief and returning to my computer a few minutes later, I discovered that option was no longer available either. Surely, the vigilance with which the restaurant industry has checked the vaccination records of its patrons for months has fueled this prevailing confidence. Even as Omicron has torn through the country in the final weeks of the year, upending everything, setting case records, canceling flights, causing long lines at testing sites, threatening a smooth reopening of school in January, returning us to the devotional of the propane heat lamp, it is hard not to feel for New York an appreciation that is snobbish, imperious, unambivalent. Rivaling nearly any place on earth, the city’s vaccination rate among adults who have so far received one shot stands at 92 percent, a figure achieved before a mandate requiring private-sector employers to have their workers immunized went into effect this week. Mask wearing on the subway and even on the street where you don’t have to cover your face — unless you are avoiding cloud bursts of weed smoke or the cold — is robust to the point that we must imagine it leaves public health officials in other places dumbfounded and envious. “There’s a matter-of-factness and a lack of whimpering, which gets everyone through,” as the playwright Paul Rudnick put it on Twitter the other day, making note of these commitments. Armed with her vaccine passport and a giddy urge to celebrate the holiday season, Laura Delgado — and 60,000 other people in Puerto Rico — attended a Bad Bunny concert three weeks ago. Three days later, she was sick with Covid-19, one of about 2,000 people who fell ill as a result of the two-day event. “We did so well; we followed the rules,” said Ms. Delgado, a 53-year-old interior designer. “We followed the mask mandate. Our vaccination rate was so high that we let our guard down. The second Christmas came, we were like, ‘We’re going to party!’” The superspreader concert helped usher in an explosion of Covid-19 cases in Puerto Rico, which until then had been celebrating one of the most successful vaccination campaigns in the United States. The concert was one of a series of business events, company holiday parties and family gatherings that fueled a 4,600 percent increase in cases on the island, a surge that public health officials worry could linger into the New Year; the Puerto Rican holiday season stretches to Three Kings Day on Jan. 6. While the Omicron variant has besieged the entire country, it is especially worrisome in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory already overwhelmed by government bankruptcy, an exodus of health professionals and a fragile health care system. Officials imposed a new wave of tough restrictions on travelers and diners in hopes of staving off the new wave of cases. Rafael Irizarry, a Harvard University statistician who keeps a dashboard of Puerto Rico Covid-19 data, tweeted the daunting facts: A third of all coronavirus cases the island has recorded since the start of the pandemic occurred in the past month. The number of cases per 100,000 residents jumped to 225, from three, in three weeks. In December, the number of hospitalizations doubled — twice. Nerves at the grocery store were already frayed, in the way of these things as the pandemic slouches toward its third year, when the customer arrived. He wanted Cambozola, a type of blue cheese. He had been cooped up for a long time. He scoured the dairy area; nothing. He flagged down an employee who also did not see the cheese. He demanded that she hunt in the back and look it up on the store computer. No luck. And then he lost it, just another out-of-control member of the great chorus of American consumer outrage, 2021 style. “Have you seen a man in his 60s have a full temper tantrum because we don’t have the expensive imported cheese he wants?” said the employee, Anna Luna, who described the mood at the store, in Minnesota, as “angry, confused and fearful.” “You’re looking at someone and thinking, ‘I don’t think this is about the cheese.’” It is a strange, uncertain moment, especially with Omicron tearing through the country. Things feel broken. The pandemic seems like a Möbius strip of bad news. Companies keep postponing back-to-the-office dates. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps changing its rules. Political discord has calcified into political hatred. And when people have to meet each other in transactional settings — in stores, on airplanes, over the phone on customer-service calls — they are, in the words of Ms. Luna, “devolving into children.”"

The team’s sale to a global sports and entertainment company had closed that day, and Mr. Gartner, 83, said he wanted to give the employees their new business cards. But there were no business cards in the envelopes that he handed out. Instead, inside were checks worth $2,000 for every year each employee had worked for the team — $600,000 in total for the 23 full-time workers. Employees who work in maintenance, accounting, marketing and other areas received checks for $4,000 to $70,000, said Mr. Gartner, who was the team’s majority owner for 22 years, until the sale closed last Tuesday. “My jaw dropped,” said Alex Cohen, 33, who has been the team’s radio broadcaster since 2018 and has worked in professional baseball since 2009. “It’s an industry where you work really hard, and sometimes you don’t get compensated like that.” Mr. Cohen described the checks as “a life-changing gesture” for some longtime staff members. “Seeing all the people who had been there for two decades, three decades, tears streaming down their faces, it was a very special, emotional day,” he said. Mr. Gartner said on Saturday that sharing proceeds from the sale “was the right thing to do.” “A lot of those people have worked for us for over 20 years, and they’ve helped us build a successful team,” said Mr. Gartner, whose gesture was reported by Yahoo! Sports. “They’re just fantastic people.” Mr. Gartner, who had owned the team with his son and three other partners, added: “They need the money more than we do. A lot of them still have mortgages and car payments and college payments.” Scott Sailor, 63, who received $46,000 for his 23 years working for the team in media relations, sales, marketing and other areas, said the checks were “not out of character” for Mr. Gartner, a businessman, lawyer and third-generation Iowa newspaperman. A former editor of The Des Moines Register and a former president of NBC News, Mr. Gartner won a Pulitzer Prize in 1997 for editorial writing at The Daily Tribune of Ames, Iowa. Two years later, he bought the Iowa Cubs, the Triple-A affiliate of the Chicago Cubs, and became a fixture in the front office and in his usual seat behind home plate. In 2020, when the minor league baseball season was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Gartner kept every full-time employee on the payroll, with benefits, Mr. Sailor said. “The surprise was not that he was generous because that’s the way he’s been,” said Randy Wehofer, the team’s vice president and assistant general manager, who joined the club in 2008. “We’ve had above-standard health insurance and 401(k) contributions, and we’ve always been the organization that people looked at and said, ‘Gee, I wish everybody did that,’” Mr. Wehofer said. “That’s always been his way, as long as I’ve been part of the organization.” Last month, however, the Cubs announced that the team had entered into an agreement to become a part of Diamond Baseball Holdings, a subsidiary of Endeavor, a global sports and entertainment company based in Beverly Hills, Calif. The sale signaled the end of Mr. Gartner’s local ownership. In a list of the 30 most valuable minor league baseball teams in 2016, Forbes placed the Iowa Cubs at No. 22, and estimated the team’s value at $30 million. Mr. Gartner declined to disclose the sale price. He said he had felt less secure owning the team since 2019, when Major League Baseball proposed a major restructuring of the lower level of the minor leagues. And at 83, he said, “I just decided it was time.” Mr. Gartner said he hoped that his former employees would stay with the Iowa Cubs, and that the checks would help persuade them not to look for jobs elsewhere. “You know their spouses and you know their kids,” Mr. Gartner said. “You see them at the ballpark and at the office every day, and you see how hard they work and how much fun they have, and how much they enjoy it. And you want to make sure they’re not tempted to go do something else.” Mr. Sailor said he had used part of his check to give his nephew and two nieces “very nice Christmas gifts” this year: $2,000 checks of their own. Dustin Halderson, 32, a stadium operations manager who is getting married in two months, said his $16,000 check gave him “some stability.” “It was nice to feel good about the work I put in, and that they recognized it,” Mr. Halderson said. “The bonus was unexpected and just so nice.”"

He has helped the space agency understand Earth’s magnetic field, explore the outer solar system and search for life on Mars. As the new year arrived on Saturday, he bade farewell to the agency. Over the past four decades, which includes 12 years as the director of NASA’s planetary science division and the last three years as its chief scientist, he has shaped much of NASA’s scientific inquiry, overseeing missions across the solar system and contributing to more than 100 scientific papers across a range of topics. While specializing in Earth’s magnetic field and plasma waves early in his career, he went on to diversify his research portfolio. One of Dr. Green’s most recent significant proposals has been a scale for verifying the detection of alien life, called the “confidence of life detection,” or CoLD, scale. He has published work suggesting we could terraform Mars, or making it habitable for humans, using a giant magnetic shield to stop the sun from stripping the red planet’s atmosphere, raising the temperature on the surface. He has also long been a proponent of the exploration of other worlds, including a mission to Europa, the icy moon of Jupiter, that is scheduled to launch in 2024. Ahead of a December meeting of the American Geophysical Union in New Orleans, Dr. Green spoke about some of this wide-ranging work and the search for life in the solar system. Below are edited and condensed excerpts from our interview. You’ve urged a methodical approach to looking for life with your CoLD scale, ranking possible detections from one to seven. Why do we need such a scale? A couple of years ago, scientists came out and said they’d seen phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus. At the level they saw it, which was enormous, that led them to believe life was one of the major possibilities. On the CoLD scale, where seven is “we found life,” it is “one.” It didn’t even make it to “two.” They recognized later there was contamination in their signal and it may not even be phosphine and we can’t reproduce it. So we have to do a better job in communicating. We see methane all over the place on Mars. Ninety-five percent of the methane we find here on Earth comes from life, but there’s a few percent that doesn’t. We’re only at a CoLD Level 3, but if a scientist came to me and said, “Here’s an instrument that will make it a CoLD Level 4,” I’d fund that mission in a minute. They’re not jumping to seven, they’re making that next big step, the right step, to make progress to actually finding life in the solar system. That’s what we’ve got to do, stop screwing around with just crying wolf. The search for life on Mars has been a focus for NASA for so long, starting in 1976 with the Viking 1 and 2 landers and later with missions from the 1990s onward. Are you surprised we haven’t found life in that time? Yes and no. What we’re doing now is much more methodical, much more intelligent in the way we recognize what signatures life can produce over time. Our solar system is 4.5 billion years old, and at this time, Earth is covered in life. But if we go back a billion years, we would find that Venus was a blue planet. It had a significant ocean. It might actually have had life, and a lot of it. If we go back another billion years, Mars was a blue planet. We know now Mars lost its magnetic field, the water started evaporating and Mars basically went stagnant about 3.5 billion years ago. We would like to have found life on the surface. We put the Viking landers in a horrible place because we didn’t know where to put them — we were just trying to put them down on the surface of Mars. It was like putting something down in the Gobi Desert. We should have put them down in Jezero Crater, in this river delta we’re at right now with the Perseverance rover, but we didn’t even know it existed at the time! One of the Viking experiments indicated there was microbial life in the soils, but only one of the three instruments did, so we couldn’t say we found life. Now we’ll really, definitively know because we’re going to bring back samples. We didn’t know it would need a sample return mission. You’ve previously suggested it might be possible to terraform Mars by placing a giant magnetic shield between the planet and the sun, which would stop the sun from stripping its atmosphere, allowing the planet to trap more heat and warm its climate to make it habitable. Is that really doable? Yeah, it’s doable. Stop the stripping, and the pressure is going to increase. Mars is going to start terraforming itself. That’s what we want: the planet to participate in this any way it can. When the pressure goes up, the temperature goes up. The first level of terraforming is at 60 millibars, a factor of 10 from where we are now. That’s called the Armstrong limit, where your blood doesn’t boil if you walked out on the surface. If you didn’t need a spacesuit, you could have much more flexibility and mobility. The higher temperature and pressure enable you to begin the process of growing plants in the soils. There are several scenarios on how to do the magnetic shield. I’m trying to get a paper out I’ve been working on for about two years. It’s not going to be well received. The planetary community does not like the idea of terraforming anything. But you know. I think we can change Venus, too, with a physical shield that reflects light. We create a shield, and the whole temperature starts going down. In 2015, NASA approved the Europa Clipper mission to search for signs of life on Jupiter’s moon Europa, set for launch in 2024, following the detection of plumes erupting from its subsurface ocean in 2013. Did you want to see that mission happen sooner? Oh, yeah, I would love to have seen it earlier, but it wasn’t going to happen. There are certain series of missions that are so big they’re called strategic missions. For them to actually happen, the stars have to align. You have to propose it, have a solid case work, go to the NASA administration and then pitch it to Congress. Every year, I proposed a Europa mission. Every year. The administration was not interested in going to Europa. The plumes on Europa are what made the Europa mission happen. I was at an American Geophysical Union meeting in 2013. Several of the scientists were going to give a talk on finding a plume with Hubble on Europa, and I go, “Oh, my God.” I said this is fantastic, I want to do a press conference. I call back to NASA headquarters, and they pulled it off. I took that information back with me to headquarters and added that into the story of Europa. That really turned the corner. They said, “Wow, maybe we should do this.” Congress decided against putting a lander on the mission. Did you want one? I would love a lander, but it’s not in the cards. It makes the mission too complicated, but everything we do on Clipper feeds forward to a lander. I insisted that we had a high-resolution imager to the point whereas we fly over certain areas, we’re going to get the information we need to go, “Let’s land right there, and safely.” Europa has got some really hazardous terrains, so if we don’t get the high-resolution imaging, we’ll never be able to land. You want to take a step, but not a huge step. You fail when you do that. Viking is that example, where we took too big a step. We didn’t know where to go, we didn’t know enough about the soils or the toxins in the soils. We hadn’t really gotten a good idea where water was on the planet in the past. There were 10 things we should have known before we put the two Vikings on the surface. Are you still going to work on scientific papers in your retirement? Oh, absolutely. I’ve got the Mars paper to do. I have a Europa paper I’m writing right now. I have an astrobiology book I’m doing. I have an insatiable appetite for science."

Twitter suspended Ms. Greene’s account after she tweeted on Saturday, falsely, about “extremely high amounts of Covid vaccine deaths.” She included a misleading chart that pulled information from a government database of unverified raw data called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, a decades-old system that relies on self-reported cases from patients and health care providers. Twitter said that Ms. Greene had a fifth “strike,” which meant that her account will not be restored. The company had issued her a fourth strike in August after she falsely posted that the vaccines were “failing.” Ms. Greene was given a third strike less than a month before that when she had tweeted that Covid-19 was not dangerous and that vaccines should not be mandated. Ms. Greene’s official Congressional account, @RepMTG, remains active because tweets from that account did not violate the service’s rules. “We’ve been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy,” Katie Rosborough, a Twitter spokeswoman, said in a statement. The company allows accounts to submit an appeal and will potentially reverse the suspension if the violating post is proven to be factual. On the alternative social messaging platform Telegram, Ms. Greene said that Twitter “is an enemy to America and can’t handle the truth.” Her suspension comes as coronavirus cases have surged again in the United States from the highly infectious Omicron variant. New York State recorded over 85,000 new coronavirus cases on the last day of 2021, the highest one-day total in the state since the pandemic began, officials announced on Saturday. Twitter has long banned users from sharing misinformation that could lead to harm. In rare cases, the company has permanently banned high-profile accounts, including the account of former President Donald J. Trump, over a risk of “further incitement of violence” after a mob of Trump loyalists stormed the U.S. Capitol last Jan. 6. There is currently no evidence of widespread major side effects from the coronavirus vaccines. Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine could trigger a rare blood clotting disorder now linked to dozens of cases and at least nine deaths in the United States in the past year. The agency recommended using other approved vaccines instead. The VAERS database, which is managed by the Food and Drug Administration and the C.D.C., has been cited in many coronavirus falsehoods to push the idea that side effects from the Covid-19 vaccines have been underreported. A spokeswoman for the F.D.A. declined to comment, but pointed to an overview of the VAERS database on the F.D.A.’s website that said VAERS reports “generally cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness.” In March, Twitter introduced a policy that explained the penalties for sharing lies about the virus and vaccines. People who violate that policy are subject to escalating punishments known as strikes and could face a permanent ban if they repeatedly share misinformation about the virus. Ms. Greene won the primary election for Georgia’s 14th Congressional District in August 2020, after rising to prominence by posting unabashed support for President Trump and for QAnon, a movement tied to the baseless conspiracy theory that a group of global liberal elites run a child sex ring that Mr. Trump would stop. Ms. Greene repeatedly posted the QAnon slogan on Facebook and Twitter and had previously called “Q” — the anonymous online account that set off the QAnon conspiracy movement — a “patriot” who was “worth listening to.” Last year, Ms. Greene heavily promoted the false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Mr. Trump, tweeting in January that there was “MASS voter fraud on a scale that should terrify every American regardless of political party.” But it was Ms. Greene’s false proclamations about the coronavirus, including opposing vaccines and masks as tools to curb the pandemic, that finally got her suspended from Twitter. In July, Ms. Greene argued that Covid-19 was not dangerous for people unless they were obese or over age 65, and said vaccines should not be required. In August, Ms. Greene said on Twitter, “The F.D.A. should not approve the covid vaccines.” She said that there were too many reports of infection and the spread of the coronavirus among vaccinated people, and that the vaccines were “failing” and “do not reduce the spread of the virus & neither do masks.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s current guidance states, “Covid-19 vaccines are effective against severe disease and death.” Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which published research on the dozen most prominent social media influencers spreading misinformation about vaccines, said it suited Ms. Greene to portray her suspension as part of a pattern of moves by Twitter to censor conservatives. “In fact, it is for the banal reason that she’s a superspreader of lies” that Ms. Greene was suspended, Mr. Ahmed said. He also criticized Twitter for not doing more to be consistent in its suspensions of high-profile users who post misinformation. “While the suspension of Representative Greene’s account for propagating deadly disinformation appears to be a valid enforcement of stated rules, it is the piecemeal enforcement that lends itself to being perceived as political,” Mr. Ahmed said."

Officials said the fire spread from an office space on the third floor of a building adjacent to the old National Assembly building toward a gym and to rooftops. The scale of the destruction was not immediately clear, they said, but there were fires burning in “two very distinct areas,” and they warned that it was likely to be extensive. Parliament’s spokesman, Moloto Mothapo, said on Sunday evening that a man in his early 50s was arrested inside the parliamentary complex on Sunday morning in connection to the fire, but he did not give any further details. “The entire parliamentary complex is severely damaged — waterlogged and smoke damaged,” JP Smith, Cape Town’s mayoral committee member for safety and security, said, adding that “the roof above the old assembly hall is completely gone.” “The second point of fire is the National Assembly building, which is gutted,” Mr. Smith said, referring to the building where the Parliament meets. “The structural ceiling has collapsed. The fire staff had to be momentarily withdrawn.” Cape Town’s Fire and Rescue Service spokesman, Jermaine Carelse, warned that the buildings themselves were at risk of collapse, given the intense heat of the fire. The roofing material was “even melting,” he said, according to the News24 website, adding, “There have been reports of some walls showing cracks.” The fire was reported around 6 a.m. and was still burning late Sunday afternoon. No injuries or fatalities have been reported. Parliament was not in session because it had been closed for the holidays. Investigators surveying the scene were trying to ascertain how the fire started and why it burned as it did. “They will have to determine how the fire spread from the one blaze to the second blaze,” Mr. Smith said, “because these are two very distinct areas. ” President Cyril Ramaphosa also arrived to inspect the damage on Sunday afternoon, and he said in a statement that he was “deeply saddened” by the event. He added that it was “very clear that this fire has devastated the parliamentary precinct and its contents and assets, including Parliament’s historical treasures of heritage.” As the fire raged early on, smoke poured from the National Assembly building’s main entrance. Later, as it was brought more under control, the smoke gave way to show the entrance’s windows blackened. Parliamentary officials said they were not aware of any sensitive documents that might have been affected by the fire. But offices belonging to lawmakers in the African National Congress as well as in two smaller opposition parties — the Good Party and the National Freedom Party — were among those badly damaged. The complex includes a structure completed in the late 1800s that is home to the National Council of Parliament, the country’s upper house. The National Assembly building is a newer addition. In March, the older building caught fire, but that blaze was quickly extinguished. “It’s tragic that we’re starting the New Year on this basis, with a fire in the old assembly that seems to be spreading to the new assembly,” Steven Swart, the chief whip of the African Christian Democratic Party, said on Sunday. The fire was still burning hours after it was first reported. At least six fire trucks and about 70 firefighters and police officers were sent to the scene, Mr. Smith said, and the streets around the complex were closed off. The blaze broke out a day after the funeral of Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate who helped lead the fight against apartheid in South Africa. It was held at St. George’s Cathedral, which is a few minutes’ walk from the Houses of Parliament. The archbishop’s ashes were interred in the cathedral on Sunday morning, in a private ceremony for his family around the time the fire was spotted. Cape Town is no stranger to fires, and wildfires on the slopes of its famed Table Mountain have had a devastating impact in recent years. Last year, a wildfire spread to the University of Cape Town, where it devoured the special collections library — home to one of the most expansive collections of first-edition books, films, photographs and other primary sources documenting the history of Southern Africa."

In Midtown, Friday night was neon-bright and pleasantly mild, but a bit foggy and soggy, matching the ambivalent mood of a city and a country primed for a change but girding for another year of unexpected setbacks and dashed optimism. Yet there were signs of real cheer. Revelers, sprinkled two-deep behind N.Y.P.D. barricades, seemed stoked and giddy (although alcohol was banned inside the celebration zone); a new mayor, Eric Adams, was taking the oath of office just after midnight; and the final day of 2021 brimmed with encouraging reports that Omicron is, in fact, less lethal than prior waves of the coronavirus. Just before midnight, city officials opened up the barricades to admit hundreds of people who had been shut out of the celebration, adding a jolt of enthusiasm at the start of the new year. But for most of the night, the small, masked and semi-socially-distanced crowd made 2022 the most Groundhog Day of New Year’s Eves, more a throwback to last year’s sparse assemblage than the unbridled bacchanals of prepandemic times. In some places, police officers outnumbered civilians, and aerial shots above Times Square featured more pavement than people, the crowd a quarter of its typical size. Nor did it help that L.L. Cool J and Chlöe, two of the biggest headliners for ABC’s legacy broadcast, “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest,” had to pull out at the last minute after they tested positive. “We were ready and I was really looking forward to ringing in 2022 in my hometown in a special way, but for now I wish everyone a healthy and happy New Year,” L.L. Cool J, who was born in Bay Shore on Long Island, said in a statement. “The best is yet to come!” But Journey played “Don’t Stop Believing,” and the U.S.O. Show Troupe did their best to encourage the troops. Mr. Seacrest, who seemed relieved to be speaking at a normal level after years of shouting to be heard over much larger gatherings, struck his signature sunny tone. He predicted that “all of the hopes and possibilities” of the new year would come to pass. Behind him, a huge marquee flashed an ad for one of the program’s main sponsors, Carnival Cruise Line. On Thursday, a day earlier, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans to “avoid cruise travel regardless of vaccination status” until Omicron reached ebb tide. Similar warnings about the perils of travel during the wildfire stage of the variant did not, however, dissuade visitors who flocked to the ball dropping to experience an apex American tourist moment. Inside a spectator pen, Sebastián de la Torre and Michelle Robayo lay on the pavement early in the evening waiting for the festivities to begin, their heads resting on squishy purple-and-yellow top hats with the logo of a gym chain that everyone was offered as they entered. Their journey from Ecuador to New York was exhausting, and not entirely without sacrifice. Ms. Robayo’s pink backpack was confiscated at the entrance, a reminder of another, continued threat to New Year’s Eve: terrorism. But they managed to salvage the contents, including two little dolls with faces like smiling zombies, called años viejos, or “old years.” At midnight, Ecuadoreans and others in Latin America ritually burn them. “You close the year on all the bad things,” Mr. de la Torre said. “Covid — I got Covid, she did too.” Thousands of revelers shook balloons, danced to music, and shouted cheers during a Times Square New Year’s Eve celebration that came far closer to resembling the prepandemic festivities than last year’s muted affair. Thousands of locals and tourists swayed together under falling confetti to James Brown’s energetic “Living in America” and U2’s mournful anthem “One.” Some paused to reflect on what the night signified to them. Wendy Kahn, 61, a retired special-needs teacher from New Orleans, said she felt an urgent need at the end of a long year to make one of her wishes come true: Spending New Year’s Eve in Times Square. “I love that we can celebrate,” she said. “Seeing the celebrities, the confetti, the lights, it’s the most amazing thing.” Jennifer Gaitan, 33, a kindergarten teacher who lives on the Upper East Side, said that she came to the New Year’s Eve celebration with a hopeful heart after two years of recalibrating her wishes. “In 2020 and 2021 we all had these high expectations, now we have to let come what may,” she said. She added that it was her dream to spend New Year’s Eve in Times Square, because she has seen it so often in movies. “It was my moral imperative to be here,” she said. Michael Bautista traveled from Japan with his wife Hidemi and their 6-year-old daughter, Mayumi. Mr. Bautista said he wanted simply to celebrate after a difficult year. “Be happy, just be happy,” said Mr. Bautista, 31, a financial worker. “Last year we had nothing like this,” said Ms. Bautista, 29. “Despite the pandemic we should be happy.” The biggest safety threat looming over the New Year’s Eve celebration in Times Square in 2021 is the coronavirus, but the perimeter of the event is guarded against a threat that became apparent 20 years ago on Sept. 11: terrorism. All cross streets from 56th Street to 37th Street have been fenced off, with concrete blocks the size of love seats on the sidewalks and dump trucks parked diagonally across the pavement. Sixth Avenue is lined with wooden blockades stenciled with, “Police Line Do Not Cross.” New York Police Department officers have been joined by F.B.I. agents from the Joint Terrorism Task Force, State Police officers, and the department’s Strategic Response officers dressed in helmets and toting long guns. For private businesses for whom official law enforcement was insufficient, there was private security on display. A private security S.U.V. was parked outside a Bryant Park bank branch, and a security guard stood watch outside the Fox News headquarters, where a Christmas tree was set on fire earlier this month. Sharon Sanchez, who owns a security company in Miami, her hometown, said the public safety apparatus on display was a welcome sight on her first visit to New York City. “I think it’s great, it keeps us all safe,” said Ms. Sanchez, 58, who wore one of the purple and yellow top hats that had been handed out to revelers. But Grace Ponce, 25, a nanny from Houston, the show of force did nothing to alleviate her primary concern. “We worry about the virus,” she said. “We know we’re taking a risk.” In Times Square, the rules limiting attendance at the New Year’s Eve festivities to 15,000 — a fraction of the normal herd — seemed to be accomplishing their purpose Thursday evening. Each block had several barricaded areas containing dozens of people apiece, but most of the streets were passable only by police officers and members of the media. Inside a spectator pen, Sebastián de la Torre and Michelle Robayo lay on the pavement, their heads resting on the squishy purple-and-yellow top hats with the logo of a gym chain that everyone was offered as they entered. They were tired, they explained. The couple, visiting New York from Ecuador, had lined up before noon, and the moment the gates were opened, sprinted to a prime viewing spot. “We just left running,” said Mr. de la Torre, 34, an architect in Quito. “They think like we are cows here.” The journey was not without sacrifice. Ms. Robayo’s pink backpack was confiscated at the entrance. “This backpack has been all around the world — Spain, Italy, France, Dubai — and they made her throw it out,” Mr. de la Torre said. He brought up a video on his phone showing Ms. Robayo, 30, giving the backpack a sad goodbye hug. But they salvaged the contents, including two little dolls with faces like smiling zombies, called años viejos, or “old years.” At midnight, Ecuadoreans and others in Latin America ritually burn them. “You close the year on all the bad things,” Mr. de la Torre said. “Covid — I got Covid, she did too.” Not that they would dare actually set fire to something in Times Square. “Maybe they’ll think we’re doing something bad,” Mr. de la Torre said, “so we’ll burn it back home.” An hour later, though, an announcer blasting over the loudspeakers seemed to have channeled them. “2021 may have been a dumpster fire, but we’re making sure that New Year’s Eve 2022 is gonna be lit!” the announcer yelled. A gigantic screen showed a garbage can aflame as the announcer interviewed people about what they hoped to leave behind — chiefly the coronavirus. Behind the barricades north of 47th Street, where people were jammed shoulder to shoulder, Zoé Fauchi said she was scared even though she was excited. “We’re wearing our masks at all times, even while eating,” said Ms. Fauchi, 22, a law student from Normandy, France, waving a Kind bar. “I try to wear it while I’m chewing.” “I think as long as we keep our masks on we will be OK,” she added, though it sounded half like a question. Her friend Emma Marianni, 21 and also a law student, explained that she could not afford to get sick. “We’re supposed to take the plane home tomorrow and we have to get tested,” she said. “If I have Covid I won’t be able to go back to France.” Not that she would mind being stuck in New York. “I actually would like to stay here,” she said, “but I have exams next week.” People who contracted the Omicron variant of the coronavirus were about half as likely to need hospital care as those infected with the Delta variant, and one-third as likely to need emergency care, according to a report issued on Friday by British health officials. The analysis of public data also found that vaccination offers strong protection against hospitalization and severe illness following Omicron infection, helping prevent the worst outcomes even as infection rates in Britain soar to record levels. The findings represent some of the largest sets of real-world data to be released since the highly contagious variant was first discovered in late November, and add to a growing body of evidence that Omicron may not present as great a danger of hospitalization and severe illness to the public as earlier variants. “The latest set of analysis is in keeping with the encouraging signs we have already seen,” said Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at the health security agency. The risk of being admitted to a hospital for Omicron cases was 65 percent lower for those who had received two doses of a vaccine, compared with those who had not received any vaccination. The rate of hospitalization was even lower among those who had received three doses of vaccine, according to the report, which was issued by the U.K. Health Security Agency. People who had received booster doses were 81 percent less likely to be admitted to the hospital, compared with unvaccinated people, according to the agency. The agency analyzed 528,176 Omicron cases and 573,012 Delta cases between Nov. 22 and Dec. 26 to assess the risk of hospitalization in England. The researchers included all cases diagnosed in the community and then assessed the risk of general admission to the hospital or admission through emergency care. In a second study, the agency examined just symptomatic cases, linked with hospitalization data, and found that three doses of a vaccine reduced the risk of hospitalization for people with the Omicron variant by 88 percent, compared with unvaccinated people with that variant. While the world grappled with a bad case of stay-at-home claustrophobia in 2021, I was lucky — or foolish — to travel to four continents. I braved a total of 20 P.C.R. tests in Montreal, London, Lisbon, Toronto, Rio and Seoul, some during which it felt like my cerebellum was being stabbed with a long swab stuck up my nostril. A few other uncherished memories stand out. Among the 20 days I spent in quarantine this past year, one I would like to forget was my night at a quarantine hotel at Toronto’s airport in June. I was escorted to my room by a uniformed security guard as an older man in the elevator sneezed, a mask dangling alarmingly beneath his nose. I twisted and turned anxiously all night, but a subsequent Covid test came back negative. Then there was the nail-biting moment midway through a Lisbon vacation in June when British authorities suddenly removed Portugal from the country’s quarantine-free travel list. That meant I would need to quarantine for 10 days in London, if I didn’t get back before the dreaded status change, and then miss my return flight home, a few days later, to Montreal. I made it — with only a few hours to spare. While I traveled mostly for work and to satisfy my wanderlust, my trips underscored the stresses of traveling at a time when often confusing health orders can change with the speed of a deadly variant. The past year was a turbulent year for global travel, and, with Omicron surging from the United States to France, the immediate outlook for 2022 seems ominous. Many travelers are putting off trips until later in the year. Commercial airlines canceled 4,500 flights around the globe over Christmas weekend. Such was the dire state of travel in 2021 in many places that Bali, long a dream destination, received only a few dozen international visitors. In Britain, the number of visitors by air plunged by 97 percent in the first half of the year, according to the British tourism authority. Stuck at home during travel-imposed quarantines, I became a plant nerd; bought things I didn’t necessarily need, like a stainless steel dental plaque remover set; and gave myself catastrophic home haircuts that made me want to cower inside an extra few weeks. I’ve been fascinated by how different countries and cultures have adapted during a pandemic. When I arrived in London in May, just as a lockdown had lifted, there was a palpable party spirit, with people thronging inside pubs and frolicking in the streets. In South Korea, praised for its early handling of the pandemic, my fellow bikers along the Han River in Seoul studiously wore their masks outside. Come nighttime, however, some office workers compensated for 10 p.m. bar closures with marathon sessions of drinking soju, the popular Korean spirit often distilled from rice, before closing time. While on vacation in body-obsessed Rio, residents and fruit juice sellers crowded the sandy beaches of Ipanema in November, perhaps momentarily putting out of their minds the more than 20 million people reported to have tested positive for the coronavirus in Brazil. But at gyms, people bench-pressed while wearing masks. As for me, I am now back in Montreal, where gyms, bars, movie theaters and spas are closed. On New Year’s Eve, I have big plans to travel — from my bed to my living room. Even as some students were packing to head to campus, Michigan State, Vanderbilt, Miami and Duke have joined the growing list of universities changing their spring semester schedules as Omicron infections spread. In an announcement Friday, Michigan State joined nearly 50 other schools that had already announced either delayed starts or remote classes. The public university in East Lansing, Mich., where classes were scheduled to begin Jan. 10, will go remote for at least three weeks. Samuel L. Stanley, Michigan State’s president, noted what he called an “intense surge” in the virus in a message to the campus on Friday. Vanderbilt University in Nashville announced a delayed start to its spring semester. Classes will start Jan. 17 rather than Jan. 10. Nearby Tennessee State University also announced on Friday that it would not reopen on schedule, delaying classes until Jan. 24. Duke University, in Durham, N.C., extended the time its classes would be virtual, until Jan. 18, and urged students to delay their arrivals to campus even though residence halls were scheduled to open on Jan. 2. In a tweet, the university said that the rate of pandemic-related hospitalizations in North Carolina had doubled. And the University of Miami said its classes, scheduled to begin Jan. 18, would be remote for the first two weeks. The subdued atmosphere caused by the pandemic on what is usually a giddy holiday was evident at the Union Square Greenmarket in Manhattan on an unseasonably warm last day of 2021, as New Yorkers said goodbye to one difficult year and steeled themselves for another. Many of those in the modest crowd perusing stands stocked with plants, vegetables, baked goods and other items did not appear overly concerned about the virus: At least half were not wearing masks, but were holding them in their hands or tucking them under their chins instead. Still, their comments told a more nuanced story. Bruce Perry, 72, of Coney Island, browsed the market’s offerings while heading to Paragon Sports on the square’s north side. The Omicron variant’s prevalence had dampened his New Year’s Eve mood. “I’m a little depressed,” he said. “I’m tired of wearing this mask every day.” He added that he had just started to feel comfortable being outside without it. “But I know we got to wear it with everything going on,” he said. “We’ve got to learn to live with it.” Mr. Perry, who is vaccinated and has gotten a booster shot, said he had been careful to avoid large crowds and had recently canceled a trip to Atlanta to visit his two daughters and three grandchildren. “I’ll just have to wait,” he said. “I don’t want to get sick, and I don’t want them to get sick.” “Hopefully 2022 will be better,” he added. “It doesn’t look like it’s getting any better.” George Martin was also on the square’s north side, playing Nat King Cole’s “Nature Boy” and “Maria” from West Side Story on his trumpet as a few passers-by dropped dollar bills in his small gray duffle bag while wishing him a Happy New Year. A 71-year-old retiree who lives on Manhattan’s Upper East Side and busks in the parks several days a week, Mr. Martin said he was sure 2022 would bring its share of problems, but that was no reason to stop living. “There’s a lot of confusion right now about Omicron, but what are you going to do?” he said. “Lock yourself in your room? Life is too short.” Soph Ehrlich, 27, a social worker, said they were weary of the pandemic and frustrated by how it had affected the poor families they work with. Still, Mx. Ehrlich, who grew up on East 15th Street and now lives in Oakland, Calif., said the sense of community that had developed over the past 12 months was encouraging. “I’m tired, but I don’t feel hopeless.” Mx. Erlich said. “I have trust in people to take care of one another.” In Brooklyn, the mood was also muted outside Woodhull Hospital Center, a city-run facility straddling the Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhoods where the line to get a P.C.R. test ran along a fenced-in driveway. Sulphina Bennett was among those who were waiting. Ms. Bennett, 39, said she had gotten sick with Covid-19 in January and had gotten vaccinated after that. So when a rapid test came back positive after she spent Christmas with her parents, she decided to get another opinion. “I’m doing this just to make sure,” Ms. Bennett, wearing an overcoat and floral-print mask, said from her place near the front of the line. She said she had been waiting for 90 minutes. Ms. Bennett said she felt like she had a mild cold. But she was not taking her symptoms lightly. A colleague died of Covid earlier in the pandemic, she said. Another had it now. “It’s like all of us are getting it one by one,” she said. The wait for tests was about 30 minutes at a city-run health clinic in a parking lot next to the Brooklyn Queens Expressway in Fort Greene. Those who were waiting included Stacey Campbell, Adam Szlachetka and their 2-year-old daughter, Noa, who started prekindergarten in September. “This is the first time she’s had to specifically test for school,” Ms. Campbell, 39, said. “I don’t know if it’s going to be regular but we did get an email saying, ‘Every child, get a test before coming back on the 4th.’” She said that tests for herself and Mr. Szlachetka, 42, were precautionary. “We’ve been lucky,” Ms. Campbell said. Both are vaccinated and neither has gotten the virus. But word that Ms. Campbell’s mother had been exposed to someone who was infected threw a scare into the family’s Christmas, setting off a frantic round of testing and online reading. “We were waiting til the last minute to see if my mom could come for Christmas,” Ms. Campbell said. “We all made it. Her and her husband had to eat in the hallway.” “Other than that,” she added with laugh, “we were all together.” As for New Year’s plans, Ms. Campbell said, “We’re going to make a champagne cocktail and get tested and feel good about that. And hope for a better 2022.” By 4 p.m., those intent on welcoming the new year at or near this year’s scaled-back version of the traditional Times Square New Year’s Eve celebration had begun to gather. Several hundred people stood on the south side of police barricades at 38th Street and Seventh Avenue, waiting to enter the section where the festivities would be held or lingering to get a distant look as the night unfolded. More than a year after Covid waylaid their grand plans, the owners of Gage & Tollner, a century-old Brooklyn chophouse that closed in 2004, reopened the doors on Fulton Street in April 2021 after a restoration of the historic site. As this difficult year came to a close, their eatery — which had been the site of an Arby’s and a TGI Fridays in the years since the previous owners closed Gage & Tollner — was recognized on several lists of New York’s best new restaurants. “We’re pretty completely proud,” said Sohui Kim, the chef partner who revitalized the spot with her husband, Ben Schneider, and St. John Frizell. “Obviously, we had to go through hoops and hurdles and really deal with all that the world dealt with in terms of Covid.” And as with the world, the year did not end without more hurdles to leap. The arrival of Omicron turned a planned brief Christmas break into a 10-day closure, until Gage reopened on Wednesday in time for New Year’s Eve. The city’s rules on mask-wearing, which had been relaxed when the pandemic eased, have been imposed yet again, and the staff is required to wear them at all times. About 30 percent of those who signed up for five-course prix fixe pampering tonight canceled. But Ms. Kim said that they hope to have more than 100 guests to toast in the New Year. Ms. Kim is back at work after herself enduring a bout of Covid over Christmas. Despite the pandemic, she and Mr. Schneider have kept afloat another business they own, Insa, a Korean barbecue and karaoke restaurant in Gowanus. But in 2022 they will have to figure out what to do with the spot where they closed the Good Fork in Red Hook at the start of the pandemic. In the meantime, they have used it as a pop-up space for aspiring young chefs such as Leland Yu. Their partner, Mr. Frizell, recently announced he would close Fort Defiance, another Red Hook spot which he had transformed during the pandemic from a restaurant into a gourmet grocery store, with hopes of reopening in the spring. “My hope for 2022 is that we could somehow see this Covid experience in the rearview mirror, and if that happens in 2022, that would be beyond awesome,” Ms. Kim said. “But we’re still in it, trying to pivot and figure out what to do.” With the news that South Africa has now passed the peak of its coronavirus cases caused by the Omicron variant, scientists are projecting that the United States’ sharp increase in cases will crest as soon as the middle of January. Over the past month the Omicron variant has spread around the world with astonishing speed, even among people who are vaccinated or who had recovered from previous infections. On Thursday the United States surpassed 580,000 cases, beating the record set only a day before. That is believed to be a vast undercount, because of testing shortages, the popularity of at-home tests and reporting delays over the holidays. What’s more, a significant number of people may have asymptomatic infections and never know it. New estimates from researchers at Columbia University suggest that the United States could peak by Jan. 9 at around 2.5 million cases per week, though that number may go as high as 5.4 million. In New York City, the first U.S. metropolis to see a major surge, the researchers estimated that cases would peak by the first week of the new year. “It’s shocking. It’s disturbing,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist who led the Columbia modeling work. “We’re seeing unprecedented numbers of Covid-19 cases.” The variant is significantly milder than Delta and other versions of the virus, and is far less likely to lead to hospitalizations, according to data from South Africa and preliminary data from Britain released on Friday. Still, the enormous numbers of people getting simultaneously infected could greatly strain hospitals, experts said, especially in places with lower vaccination rates or in places where hospitals are already overburdened. Just how much of a burden the variant will be, however, depends on how quickly it will burn out in particular communities, especially in large cities. Those complex transmission dynamics have been maddeningly difficult to predict with precision. Another model, released by a research group from the University of Washington last week, estimated that the United States would reach a peak in cases by the end of January. But even those researchers are now rethinking their projections based on Omicron’s rapid spread. “We are realizing right now monitoring the data that the peak is going to come much faster,” said Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington. “My guess is it will happen before mid-January.” The numbers are increasing so quickly that some epidemiologists say modeling isn’t even necessary to see where things are headed, said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “The context for all of this is that hospitals are struggling,” Dr. Hanage said. “We don’t have that much spare capacity. And of course, Omicron makes that worse.” There are some reasons to think that the variant’s behavior in the United States might be different than in other countries. In South Africa, for example, the population is much younger, and a large proportion had been infected by earlier waves of the virus. In Britain, the vaccination rate for older people is much higher than in the United States. While South Africa saw a rapid increase in cases followed by a sharp decline, it’s unclear whether cases will crest in the United States in a similar fashion. Because of the number of unknowns, including the emergence of new variants and government restrictions aimed at curbing transmission, Shaman’s group limits its projections to four to six weeks in the future. Two things can cause new infections to decline, according to Natalie Dean, an epidemiologist at Emory University. The biggest contributor is that the virus can burn through people in certain communities, especially dense cities; when it stops finding people to infect, new cases decline. People may also change their behaviors, whether through societal restrictions or on their own, giving the virus fewer opportunities to find them. “Our communities are complicated — it doesn’t mean that everyone in the community has gotten infected,” Dr. Dean said. “It’s kind of the people who are most connected.” The United States could also see more localized outbreaks, with cases beginning to decline in current hot spots, like New York City and Washington D.C., just as they’re beginning to take off elsewhere. That could lead to more of a rounded peak instead of a sharp turnaround, Dr. Shaman said. Nearly 600,000 public university students in New York will soon be required to get vaccination booster shots as part of the state’s stepped-up effort to combat a record-breaking coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on Friday. In addition, State University of New York and City University of New York faculty members will now be subject to a vaccination requirement, and a statewide mask mandate that is already in effect will be extended until at least the end of January, Ms. Hochul said at a morning news briefing. The governor unveiled the measures, part of a broader plan labeled “Winter Surge 2.0,” as the fast-spreading Omicron variant continued to push the number of virus cases in the state to new heights with each passing day. On Thursday, the state reported 74,000 new cases of the virus; about 44,000 were in New York City. On Friday, Ms. Hochul announced 76,000 new cases, with the New York City region having the most per capita. The positivity rate for tests was 16 percent statewide, she said. “We are breaking records every day, and we will continue to do so until we hit that downward trend,” the governor said. Hospitalizations linked to the virus have also risen sharply, to almost 8,000 across the state. About half were in New York City. Twenty-one hospitals in the state have suspended elective surgeries as a result of the rise in virus patients. Ms. Hochul called the increase in hospitalizations “very concerning” while speaking at the briefing. “They are putting a lot of stress on an already overtaxed health care system,” she said. To help address the problem, the governor said the state would be releasing more ventilation machines from its stockpile and dispatching additional members of the National Guard to hospitals that are especially overtaxed. The booster requirement for SUNY and CUNY students, which takes effect Jan. 15, reflects Ms. Hochul’s desire to keep the state’s public education system operating with in-person classes at all levels despite the Omicron-driven outbreak. Dozens of colleges and universities in the United States have already taken such a step. New York’s public university students will also be required to show a negative Covid-19 test result when they return to campus, and masks will be mandatory indoors, Ms. Hochul said. As part of her drive to keep schools open and avoid what she has called last year’s “failed experiment” in remote learning, the governor said that more than five million rapid test kits would be provided to school districts serving students from kindergarten to 12th grade. The goal in distributing the kits is to allow for “test-to-stay” policies under which a student takes two rapid tests if a classmate tests positive. If the tests come back negative, the student can remain in school, she said. As for the mask mandate, New York State has had one in place since Dec. 13 for all indoor public places, including offices, building lobbies and stores. Businesses can opt out if they require full vaccination for everyone 12 and older. Children 5 to 11 must have at least one vaccine dose. Ms. Hochul originally said the mask mandate would end on Jan. 15, but on Friday she extended it through the end of January because of the soaring virus case numbers. New York’s fight to contain the virus is also drawing reinforcements from the federal government, which is deploying disaster response units to the state, sending 50 ambulance teams to New York City and dispatching emergency medical teams to SUNY Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse and the Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo, officials said."

Amber Santos stood beside the trash bins they had carried inside the car, which reeked of food leftovers from Ten 3, a restaurant at the top of Sandia Peak near Albuquerque. Almost home, she thought as she felt the tramway system, which shuttles people to the restaurant 10,300 feet above sea level, start to move. Twenty people were in one car, and one person was in another — 19 employees of Ten 3 and two employees of the tramway system — who were headed home to celebrate 2022. Then, near the second tower of the tramway, the cars stopped. At 10 p.m., nothing. At 11 p.m., still no movement. “Something’s not right,” Ms. Santos recalled telling her colleagues. Finally, the countdown until 2022 had, for those stranded, become a countdown until their rescue. It would take more than 12 hours. As temperatures dipped into the mid-20s, the passengers resorted to rationing Life Savers gummies and six bottles of water as they spent the first few hours of 2022 waiting for rescue crews to arrive. By Saturday afternoon, all of the stranded passengers had been rescued. No one was injured, officials said. Spencer Moreland, an incident commander for New Mexico Search and Rescue, which provided about 30 volunteers who helped with the rescue, got a call from the New Mexico State Police at 3 a.m. He was on the scene by 4 a.m., and an hour later, rescuers had begun the more than four-hour hike up the steep terrain in a snowstorm. Rescuers had to get to a tower, climb to the tram and set up a rope system to lower people to safety, he said. From there, they hiked with the passengers about 100 yards to a landing site where a helicopter whisked them away a few at a time. Rescuers battled treacherous conditions, said Larry Koren, the pilot who flew the stranded to safety by landing his helicopter on a narrow ridge. Mr. Koren, who is also the undersheriff for the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office, said members of the sheriff’s office, along with other local officials, had trained with the tramway operator for just such a situation. Such a rescue was one that they had considered but never executed, he said, adding, “And we never expected it would be for 21 people in a snowstorm.” Michael Donovan, general manager of Sandia Peak Aerial Tramway, said that wind and ice had caused an emergency cable to cross over another cable, preventing the tram cars from reaching their destination. He said rescuers were lucky that visibility had improved, allowing for a helicopter rescue. Otherwise, the stranded crew members might have had to hike to safety, a trek they were not equipped for. “Some of the cooks had Crocs on,” he said. At first, being trapped in a tram car for New Year’s Eve had been welcomed as a funny, yet dangerous, adventure, Ms. Santos said. Her Instagram videos show her and the others yelling “Happy New Year!” at midnight. But then the temperature began to drop. At 12:57 a.m., it was 35 degrees. The passengers retrieved emergency blankets stored in the car and broke out hard pretzels and Life Savers gummies from their backpacks.  “Everyone’s quiet,” said Ms. Santos, 31. “It’s dark. It’s freezing. We’re literally freezing or shivering because the small safety blankets don’t retain any heat.” She added, “You just start thinking, ‘Is this how I’m going to die, in a tiny box with my co-workers?’” The wind swayed the car like a playground swing. At 3:49 a.m., they were bunched together, mostly silent, but still supportive of one another, Ms. Santos said. It was 24 degrees, and she continued to shiver, unable to sleep. She tried to think positive thoughts: At least the car had a built-in toilet. And at least they could communicate with the tramway system workers through a speaker on the car. The workers told them help was on the way. But by 4 a.m., she believed she was going to die, she said. “You just felt hopeless,” Ms. Santos said. “You’re cold. You’re sad. You just want to be at home on New Year’s with your friends, doing what other people do.” When rescue crews finally arrived, she immediately reached for a blanket and a water bottle. After rappelling to the ground, which she said was “actually very exciting,” she got on the helicopter, was checked by medical workers and then walked to her car. She opened up Instagram one more time and recorded a message. “I literally have no words for today,” she said. “I’m literally out of words. This has been horrible.”"

By the next year, after scouring bookstores and private collections scattered across the Middle East and Europe, they had returned with 2,700 volumes — and the library of the Pontifical Oriental Institute, a graduate school dedicated to the study of the Eastern branch of Christianity, was born. “I was perched on a ladder, amid the dust and the heat,” Tisserant recalled years later of his time in Constantinople, where he examined volumes “one by one, for entire days.” Modern-day church scholars may find the going a lot easier. Some of the texts at the Rome institute, which over the years swelled to some 200,000 works, have just been digitized, and will soon be at the fingertips of a global audience — no voyages or ladders needed. The first digitized versions will be available to the public in mid-2022, the product of a charitable initiative that connected the institute with technology companies in the United States and Germany. “You know, like a Mickey Rooney film: I got the costumes, I know a guy who has a barn, and we can put the play on there,” said the Rev. David Nazar, the institute’s rector. The companies, he said, immediately understood the value of the project. Many of the books come from countries like Syria, Lebanon or Iraq, where war or other turmoil put entire collections at risk. Others come from countries where authoritarian censorship was equally threatening. “We’re not a hospital, we’re not in the fields of Syria,” Father Nazar said, “but we have students that come from there, who study here because our resources haven’t been destroyed by war.” Though most of the institute’s titles are not recognizable to the general public — the six-volume, 19th-century Eastern Orthodox canon collection “Syntagma tôn theiôn kai hierôn kanonôn” never did make a best-seller list — they are precious to scholars. They include volumes like a Greek first edition of liturgies of John Chrysostom, an early church father, printed in Rome in 1526. “The library is unique in the world,” said Gabriel Radle, a professor at the University of Notre Dame who studied at the institute a decade ago. Its volumes cover the broad gamut that is Eastern Christianity, a catchall term for the traditions and denominations that developed in the first centuries of the church in Jerusalem and the Middle East, spreading through Greece, Turkey and Eastern Europe, north to Russia, south to Egypt and Ethiopia, and as far east as India. The first set of books to be digitized were scanned by an eight-member team from a Long Island company, Seery Systems Group, using scanning technology from SMA of Germany. The project was somewhat unusual for Richard Seery, whose company’s clients are typically state and local governments. “I told people I usually don’t travel over the bridge to New Jersey on business, and now I’m going to Rome,” Mr. Seery said in a telephone interview. The material was a first for him, too. “One page may be in German, the next page in Sanskrit or some other language,” Mr. Seery said of his experience scanning the texts. “And what was funny was that after going through page after page, book after book, all of a sudden I could read something — English, something in English.” The digitized books will be managed via ShelterZoom, a New York company whose blockchain technology will ensure that the institute will retain ownership of the volumes and control over their consumption. Chao Cheng-Shorland, the chief executive of ShelterZoom, said she visited the library this past year and got very excited about the project. “It’s unique, not just in the technology sense but also in the sense of contributing to such a wonderful piece of history,” she said in a telephone interview. ShelterZoom is underwriting the first phase of the project. Fabio Tassone, the director of the library, said scanning priority had been given to the books most in demand, those that deal with Eastern liturgy and the study of the early Christian writers of the Eastern churches. Journals published by the institute itself, particularly issues that included unpublished manuscripts, their translation and scientific analysis, were also among the first to be digitized. In all, about 500 volumes have been digitized so far, he said, with plans to continue the process in the future. The material reflects the uniqueness of the institute, where “you can study all the Eastern churches, not just one,” Father Nazar said. “We preserve the resources of so many of these Eastern cultures and churches for people to come back and look at their roots, especially when things are in disarray.” Tisserant’s own book-buying efforts reflected the breadth of the institute’s mission, and the depth of its commitment Back in 1923, his assistant, the Eastern Catholic priest Cyrille Korolevskij, split off for Romania, Transylvania, Hungary and Poland, before finally arriving in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. “He was hoping to reach Bosnia, but was forced to give up,” Tisserant recalled in a letter written in 1955, by which time his own star had risen. Tisserant had gone on to head the Vatican Library and, as the dean of the College of Cardinals, later presided at the funeral Masses of Pope Pius XII in 1958 and Pope John XXIII in 1963. Many of the books the institute went on to collect came from countries that were part of the former Soviet Union. The library has some unexpected gems as a result, like a complete collection of the newspapers Izvestia and Pravda from the Soviet period, including issues that cannot be found in Russia, Mr. Tassone said, “because they were made to disappear.” The institute, which is working out a fee schedule for access to the digitized volumes, will continue digitizing the collection even after its charitable partners have gone. It ended up purchasing the scanner with that in mind. The pandemic has driven home the value of the project, another former student said. The former student, Lejla Demiri, now the chairwoman of Islamic doctrine at the University of Tübingen, Germany, wrote in an email that two years of shutdowns and lockdowns had proven “how crucial it is to have digital access to academic sources.” No ladder required."

So what should you do if you’re one of them? We spoke to physicians and infectious disease experts about the steps you should take after a positive test or if you find out you’ve been in close contact with an infected person. Here’s their advice. If you’re in public or around people when you get the bad news, put on a mask immediately. Then isolate yourself as quickly as possible, even if you don’t have symptoms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends isolating for at least five full days, followed by five days of wearing a mask around others, as long as you don’t have a fever and any other symptoms are improving. If you are seriously ill with Covid or have a weakened immune system, the C.D.C. recommends an isolation period of 10 to 20 days. If you have a fever, the agency advises you to stay home until the fever resolves. Read more about the new C.D.C. guidelines. If you are waiting for test results but have symptoms of Covid-19, the C.D.C. now recommends that you isolate anyway, regardless of vaccination status. If you live with roommates or family, try to separate yourself from other people (and animals) as much as possible. “You should take yourself out of society,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco. “Wall yourself up in a cocoon.” Isolating in a home with other people may be difficult, but do the best you can. That means staying in your room, away from other members of the household, even for meals. Someone should deliver food to your bedroom door if possible. If the home has more than one bathroom, designate one just for the infected person. If the infected person is a child or older person who needs assistance, both the caregiver and the infected person should wear a mask when the caregiver enters the room, and open the windows if possible. If others are in the house, always wear a high-quality mask when you leave your room. Everyone should mask up in shared spaces. After using a shared bathroom, disinfect the toilet seat and handle, as well as the faucet handles, soap dispenser, counter and light switch. Close the lid before you flush, and turn on the exhaust fan. Open windows to improve ventilation in shared areas. The people living in your household should take precautions, but they don’t need to panic about getting infected too, especially if they’re vaccinated and boosted. “The household rate of contracting Covid from someone is not 100 percent by a long shot, even with the more transmissible variants,” said Dr. Paul Sax, an infectious disease expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School. While it can help incrementally to continue to wipe down shared spaces, “the most important thing is keeping people from breathing air that is filled with germs,” said Tara Kirk Sell, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. If you have a HEPA air cleaner, place it in or outside your bedroom. If you’ve tested positive and feel well, you can take a walk outdoors and get fresh air. If you’re in a city where you will cross paths with other people, wear a mask and keep your distance. If you tested positive after taking a rapid home test, you may want to take a second home test using a different brand or go to a testing center to confirm the result. False positives aren’t common with home tests, but they can happen. Even so, you should assume the positive result is correct, wear a mask and avoid close contact with other people until you get retested. If your positive test came from a laboratory, a second test isn’t necessary. If you receive a negative test on your rapid home test, don’t use that as your sole basis for decision making. The C.D.C. advises that a negative result on a rapid home test does not rule out a Covid infection. To improve the results from an antigen test, the agency recommends testing twice over a three-day period with at least 24 hours and no more than 48 hours between tests. No. In most cases, you won’t know which variant of coronavirus you’ve caught and your lab test typically won’t tell you. In general, the guidance on isolation, monitoring and treatment does not change based on which variant infected you. Think about where you’ve been and who might have inhaled your germs. Contact your employer and let them know. Most workplaces have protocols in place for contact tracing when an employee tests positive. You also want to alert anyone with whom you’ve spent time, going back at least two days before you got tested or started having symptoms, said Dr. Sax. The C.D.C. defines a close contact as someone who was less than six feet from you for 15 minutes or more. It may feel overwhelming, or even shameful, to tell people about your positive test, said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. “A lot of people think it’s some failure if you get infected,” Dr. Jha said. “This is an incredibly contagious variant. A lot of people are going to get it. That is not a moral failure.” Don’t forget to tell your doctor too, particularly if you have an underlying medical condition, like high blood pressure or diabetes, that puts you at higher risk. If the infected person is a child, call your pediatrician. You also need to call your child’s school, as well as anyone they’ve had close contact with at play dates, parties or other activities. Monitor your symptoms. You can use a pulse oximeter to keep track of your blood oxygen levels. Most healthy people will get an oxygen reading around 95 to 99 percent. You should seek medical advice if the reading drops quickly or the level dips to 93 percent or lower. The devices can be less accurate for people with darker skin, so pay attention to the trend. If your reading drops by four points, it’s worth checking in with a doctor. You should also see a doctor if you take a turn for the worse, have trouble breathing or have any symptom that causes you concern. You can learn more in our story, Why Days 5 to 10 Are So Important When You Have Coronavirus. Ask your doctor if you are eligible for monoclonal antibodies, a treatment that can help your body fight Covid-19 and lower your risk for severe illness, particularly for people in a high-risk group. For monoclonal antibody therapy to be most effective, it needs to be given soon after diagnosis, even if you’re not feeling bad yet. If you don’t have a regular doctor, you can also contact the infectious disease clinic at your hospital and ask about the treatment, said Dr. Celine Gounder, an epidemiologist at N.Y.U. medical school. Only one monoclonal antibody treatment, sotrovimab made by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology, has performed well against Omicron in laboratory experiments. Although the supply of sotrovimab is very limited, the Biden administration is in talks with GlaxoSmithKline about securing more doses to be delivered by early next year. The Food and Drug Administration has authorized two different oral treatments for people who are vulnerable to becoming severely ill because they are older or have medical conditions such as obesity or diabetes. Paxlovid, developed by Pfizer, is authorized for high-risk patients age 12 and older, and is meant to be taken as 30 pills over five days. Another pill treatment from Merck, known as molnupiravir, has been authorized for people 18 and older, and is meant to be taken as 40 pills over five days. To calculate your five-day isolation period, count your first day of symptoms as Day 0. If you never had symptoms but have a confirmed positive test, count Day 0 as the day you tested. You can leave isolation after five days if you don’t have a fever and any symptoms you had are getting better. If your symptoms persist or get worse, if you are immunocompromised or are severely ill with Covid, consult with your health care provider about when to leave isolation, which may last between 10 and 20 days. After isolation, the C.D.C. advises that you keep wearing a mask around others for an additional five days. Don’t remove your mask to eat or drink around other people, don’t travel and don’t spend time around high risk people until the masking period has ended. Although the agency didn’t recommend testing after isolation, the new guidelines say people should take a rapid antigen test after the five day isolation period if they have “access to a test and want to test.” Vaccinated adults who had booster shots and fully vaccinated children don’t need to quarantine after a potential exposure, but they should get tested five days later and wear masks around other people for 10 days.  People who are unvaccinated should quarantine for five days after exposure and then get tested. Wear masks around other people for 10 days. This also applies to people who are eligible for booster shots but have not received them yet. The C.D.C. has said that unvaccinated students who are exposed to the virus do not need to miss school after a potential exposure as long as two tests taken during the next week are negative. Read more about the “test to stay” protocol. Yes. The degree of protection you get from a previous infection varies widely. You’re more protected if you’ve also been vaccinated. Early studies suggest antibodies from a past Covid infection alone are not a strong defense against Omicron. “Unfortunately, reinfection after people have had Covid before, can occur, and the protection of previous infections is very variable and unpredictable,” said Dr. David Rubin, the director of PolicyLab at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. “So some people seem to be very protected and don’t get Covid again, and other people can get it again and even get quite severe disease again.”"

Here are 10 findings to remember next time you head to the supermarket or to the kitchen. In October, the American Heart Association released new dietary guidelines to improve the hearts and health of Americans of all ages and life circumstances. Instead of issuing a laundry list of “thou shalt not eats,” the committee focused on how people could make lifelong changes, taking into account each individual’s likes and dislikes as well as ethnic and cultural practices and life circumstances. “For example, rather than urging people to skip pasta because it’s a refined carbohydrate, a more effective message might be to tell people to eat it the traditional Italian way, as a small first-course portion,” Jane Brody explained. As people grappled with higher levels of stress, depression and anxiety during the pandemic, many turned to their favorite comfort foods: ice cream, pastries, pizza, hamburgers. But studies in an emerging field of research known as nutritional psychiatry, which looks at the relationship between diet and mental wellness, suggest that the sugar-laden and high-fat foods we often crave when we are stressed or depressed, as comforting as they may seem, are the least likely to benefit our mental health. Whole foods such as vegetables, fruit, fish, eggs, nuts and seeds, beans and legumes and fermented foods like yogurt may be a better bet. “The idea that eating certain foods could promote brain health, much the way it can promote heart health, might seem like common sense,” Anahad O’Connor wrote in his story on the research. “But historically, nutrition research has focused largely on how the foods we eat affect our physical health, rather than our mental health.” Coffee is beloved by many, but its health benefits have often been called into question. The latest assessments this year of the health effects of coffee and caffeine, however, were reassuring. Their consumption has been linked to a reduced risk of all kinds of ailments, including Parkinson’s disease, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, gallstones, depression, suicide, cirrhosis, liver cancer, melanoma and prostate cancer. Scientists know that the trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in our guts play an important role in health, influencing our risk of developing obesity, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and a wide range of other conditions. In 2021, a large international study found that the composition of these microorganisms, collectively known as our microbiomes, is largely shaped by what we eat. Researchers learned that a diet rich in nutrient-dense, whole foods supported the growth of beneficial microbes that promoted good health. Eating a diet full of highly processed foods with added sugars, salt and other additives had the opposite effect, promoting gut microbes that were linked to worse cardiovascular and metabolic health. Potato chips, ice cream, pizza and more unhealthy foods continue to dominate the American diet, despite being linked to obesity, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and other health problems. “They are cheap and convenient, and engineered to taste good. They are aggressively marketed by the food industry,” Mr. O’Connor reported in a story about new research on whether these foods are not just tempting, but addictive. The notion has sparked controversy among researchers, he said. One study found that certain foods were especially likely to elicit “addictive-like” eating behaviors, such as intense cravings, a loss of control, and an inability to cut back despite experiencing harmful consequences and a strong desire to stop eating them. But other experts pointed out that these foods do not cause an altered state of mind, a hallmark of addictive substances. Unsweetened carbonated water is a better choice than soda or fruit juice, Christina Caron reported, but it probably shouldn’t be your main source of water. Seltzer has the potential to be erosive to your teeth, experts told her, and carbonated beverages can contribute to gas and bloating, Ms. Caron wrote. Unique factors like body size, outdoor temperature and how hard you’re breathing and sweating will determine how much water you need, an expert told Christie Aschwanden for her story on what it really means to “stay hydrated.” “For most young, healthy people, the best way to stay hydrated is simply to drink when you’re thirsty,” she learned. “Those who are older, in their 70s and 80s, may need to pay more attention to getting sufficient fluids because the thirst sensation can decrease with age.” Yogurt, kimchi and kombucha have long been dietary staples in many parts of the world. But this year, as Mr. O’Connor reported, scientists discovered that these fermented foods may alter the makeup of the trillions of bacteria, viruses and fungi that inhabit our intestinal tracts, collectively known as the gut microbiome. They may also lead to lower levels of body-wide inflammation, which scientists increasingly link to a range of diseases tied to aging. Acid reflux is among the most frequent health complaints of American adults, and may have become even more common in the wake of pandemic-related stress and weight gain. Jane Brody covered new research that showed that those who adhered to five key lifestyle characteristics — including exercise and following a Mediterranean-style diet, featuring fruits and vegetables, fish, poultry and whole grains — were more likely to ward off discomfort from the most persistent and potentially serious form of reflux. A study first published in July found that flavonoids, the chemicals that give plant foods their bright colors, may help curb the frustrating forgetfulness and mild confusion that older people often complain about with advancing age. Further follow-up would be needed to determine whether foods might affect the risk of developing dementia, and there are also broader policy issues at play, making it difficult for everyone to access fresh fruits and vegetables, Nicholas Bakalar reported. But, experts agreed these are foods you should be eating for brain health. "

There was anticipation for vaccines, followed by confusing rollouts. Then, we saw some hope as many Americans were inoculated, only to find new variants, a tumultuous news cycle and widespread confusion around the bend. The good news is that people across the country — including experts, public figures and kids — started talking more openly and helpfully about the importance of mental health. Here at Well, we offered tools to stay balanced in the face of so much stress and anxiety. As the year comes to a close, we’ve collected the top pieces of advice from our most popular mental health stories to help you carry calm and clarity into 2022. Back in April, Adam Grant had already called it; he said, “Languishing might be the dominant emotion of 2021.” People certainly knew they were feeling some kind of way, but it wasn’t burnout or depression or even boredom. “Languishing is the neglected middle child of mental health,” Dr. Grant wrote. “It’s the void between depression and flourishing — the absence of well-being.” He provided some tips to cure languishing, but the powerful first step Dr. Grant proposed was simply naming the feeling. Doing so gave us “a clearer window into what had been a blurry experience,” he wrote, and a socially acceptable response to the question: “How are you?”"

Read more in a note from Times Opinion’s politics editor Ezekiel Kweku in our Opinion Today newsletter. One year after the smoke and broken glass, the mock gallows and the very real bloodshed of that awful day, it is tempting to look back and imagine that we can, in fact, simply look back. To imagine that what happened on Jan. 6, 2021 — a deadly riot at the seat of American government, incited by a defeated president amid a last-ditch effort to thwart the transfer of power to his successor — was horrifying but that it is in the past and that we as a nation have moved on. This is an understandable impulse. After four years of chaos, cruelty and incompetence, culminating in a pandemic and the once-unthinkable trauma of Jan. 6, most Americans were desperate for some peace and quiet. On the surface, we have achieved that. Our political life seems more or less normal these days, as the president pardons turkeys and Congress quarrels over spending bills. But peel back a layer, and things are far from normal. Jan. 6 is not in the past; it is every day. It is regular citizens who threaten election officials and other public servants, who ask, “When can we use the guns?” and who vow to murder politicians who dare to vote their conscience. It is Republican lawmakers scrambling to make it harder for people to vote and easier to subvert their will if they do. It is Donald Trump who continues to stoke the flames of conflict with his rampant lies and limitless resentments and whose twisted version of reality still dominates one of the nation’s two major political parties. In short, the Republic faces an existential threat from a movement that is openly contemptuous of democracy and has shown that it is willing to use violence to achieve its ends. No self-governing society can survive such a threat by denying that it exists. Rather, survival depends on looking back and forward at the same time. Truly grappling with the threat ahead means taking full account of the terror of that day a year ago. Thanks largely to the dogged work of a bipartisan committee in the House of Representatives, this reckoning is underway. We know now that the violence and mayhem broadcast live around the world was only the most visible and visceral part of the effort to overturn the election. The effort extended all the way into the Oval Office, where Mr. Trump and his allies plotted a constitutional self-coup. We know now that top Republican lawmakers and right-wing media figures privately understood how dangerous the riot was and pleaded with Mr. Trump to call a halt to it, even as they publicly pretended otherwise. We know now that those who may have critical information about the planning and execution of the attack are refusing to cooperate with Congress, even if it means being charged with criminal contempt. For now, the committee’s work continues. It has scheduled a series of public hearings in the new year to lay out these and other details, and it plans to release a full report of its findings before the midterm elections — after which, should Republicans regain control of the House as expected, the committee will undoubtedly be dissolved. This is where looking forward comes in. Over the past year, Republican lawmakers in 41 states have been trying to advance the goals of the Jan. 6 rioters — not by breaking laws but by making them. Hundreds of bills have been proposed and nearly three dozen laws have been passed that empower state legislatures to sabotage their own elections and overturn the will of their voters, according to a running tally by a nonpartisan consortium of pro-democracy organizations. Some bills would change the rules to make it easier for lawmakers to reject the votes of their citizens if they don’t like the outcome. Others replace professional election officials with partisan actors who have a vested interest in seeing their preferred candidate win. Yet more attempt to criminalize human errors by election officials, in some cases even threatening prison. Many of these laws are being proposed and passed in crucial battleground states like Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, the Trump campaign targeted voting results in all these states, suing for recounts or trying to intimidate officials into finding “missing” votes. The effort failed, thanks primarily to the professionalism and integrity of election officials. Many of those officials have since been stripped of their power or pushed out of office and replaced by people who openly say the last election was fraudulent. Thus the Capitol riot continues in statehouses across the country, in a bloodless, legalized form that no police officer can arrest and that no prosecutor can try in court. This isn’t the first time state legislatures have tried to wrest control of electoral votes from their own people, nor is it the first time that the dangers of such a ploy have been pointed out. In 1891, President Benjamin Harrison warned Congress of the risk that such a “trick” could determine the outcome of a presidential election. The Constitution guarantees to all Americans a republican form of government, Harrison said. “The essential features of such a government are the right of the people to choose their own officers” and to have their votes counted equally in making that choice. “Our chief national danger,” he continued, is “the overthrow of majority control by the suppression or perversion of popular suffrage.” If a state legislature were to succeed in substituting its own will for that of its voters, “it is not too much to say that the public peace might be seriously and widely endangered.” A healthy, functioning political party faces its electoral losses by assessing what went wrong and redoubling its efforts to appeal to more voters the next time. The Republican Party, like authoritarian movements the world over, has shown itself recently to be incapable of doing this. Party leaders’ rhetoric suggests they see it as the only legitimate governing power and thus portrays anyone else’s victory as the result of fraud — hence the foundational falsehood that spurred the Jan. 6 attack, that Joe Biden didn’t win the election. “The thing that’s most concerning is that it has endured in the face of all evidence,” said Representative Adam Kinzinger, one of the vanishingly few Republicans in Congress who remain committed to empirical reality and representative democracy. “And I’ve gotten to wonder if there is actually any evidence that would ever change certain people’s minds.” The answer, for now, appears to be no. Polling finds that the overwhelming majority of Republicans believe that President Biden was not legitimately elected and that about one-third approve of using violence to achieve political goals. Put those two numbers together, and you have a recipe for extreme danger. Political violence is not an inevitable outcome. Republican leaders could help by being honest with their voters and combating the extremists in their midst. Throughout American history, party leaders, from Abraham Lincoln to Margaret Chase Smith to John McCain, have stood up for the union and democracy first, to their everlasting credit. Democrats aren’t helpless, either. They hold unified power in Washington, for the last time in what may be a long time. Yet they have so far failed to confront the urgency of this moment — unwilling or unable to take action to protect elections from subversion and sabotage. Blame Senator Joe Manchin or Senator Kyrsten Sinema, but the only thing that matters in the end is whether you get it done. For that reason, Mr. Biden and other leading Democrats should make use of what remaining power they have to end the filibuster for voting rights legislation, even if nothing else. Whatever happens in Washington, in the months and years to come, Americans of all stripes who value their self-government must mobilize at every level — not simply once every four years but today and tomorrow and the next day — to win elections and help protect the basic functions of democracy. If people who believe in conspiracy theories can win, so can those who live in the reality-based world. Above all, we should stop underestimating the threat facing the country. Countless times over the past six years, up to and including the events of Jan. 6, Mr. Trump and his allies openly projected their intent to do something outrageous or illegal or destructive. Every time, the common response was that they weren’t serious or that they would never succeed. How many times will we have to be proved wrong before we take it seriously? The sooner we do, the sooner we might hope to salvage a democracy that is in grave danger."

The sewage leaked out of a manhole on 212th Street on Thursday evening and much of Friday, Mr. Langpap said. From there, the waste traveled through storm drain pipes and toward the Dominguez Channel, a flood-control waterway that runs more than 15 miles from Hawthorne, Calif., and discharges into Los Angeles Harbor. Water from the channel eventually flows to the Pacific Ocean. Officials are investigating what caused the pipe, which was built in the 1960s, to collapse. “We actually have a project in construction now that was going to replace this sewer; that project isn’t done,” Mr. Langpap said. “So I’m sure it was related to age, but what was the straw that broke the camel’s back, we don’t know yet.” At least five beaches were closed on Saturday, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, disrupting holiday plans and leading to the cancellation of some events, such as the 70th annual Polar Bear Swim at Cabrillo Beach. Dr. Anissa Davis, the Long Beach City health officer, said in a statement on Friday that inspectors were “monitoring water quality along the affected beach sites,” and that beaches would be closed until the water quality met state requirements. Untreated sewage and polluted water can expose swimmers to pathogens, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Janice Hahn, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, said on Twitter on Friday that “a spill of this magnitude is dangerous and unacceptable, and we need to understand what happened.” She added that recent storms in the area, which have brought heavy rain across the state, most likely contributed to the collapse. “We need infrastructure that doesn’t fail when it rains,” Ms. Hahn said. Since Thursday, crews have set up five sewer bypass pipe systems, which suck sewage out of a blockage and into another manhole, Mr. Langpap said. By Friday night, crews had stopped the spill entirely, he said. But because the spill was occurring near a freeway, the unclogging process was complicated and prolonged, leading to millions more gallons of waste being spilled, Mr. Langpap said. “We never want to have a sewage spill,” he said. “That’s our job, is to collect and treat the sewage and protect the environment. So it is a large flow, and we just have to do that monitoring now to see what impact was there.” On Saturday morning, crews were working on temporarily restoring the collapsed sewer line, and a permanent repair will be done later, though an exact timeline has yet to be determined, Mr. Langpap said. The Dominguez Channel was the site of another environmental problem this year. A fire in September at a beauty product warehouse in Carson released a foul stench in the air and chemicals into the sewage system that ultimately drained into the Dominguez Channel. The spill led to the decay of organic materials in the channel, resulting in the emission of hydrogen sulfide gas that far exceeded the state’s nuisance standard, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works. Last summer, 17 million gallons of raw sewage were discharged into Santa Monica Bay after a sprawling wastewater treatment plant in Los Angeles experienced problems, prompting several beach closures."

But nearly two years into the pandemic, many people are still confused about the best way to get tested for Covid-19, or frustrated that they can’t find a test. Stores have run out of home tests, and long lines at testing centers have made it difficult for people to find out quickly if they are infected. We asked public health experts for answers to some common questions about coronavirus testing during the Omicron surge. Here’s what they had to say. Virus tests are categorized based on what they look for: molecular tests, which look for the virus’s genetic material, and antigen tests that look for viral proteins. But comparing rapid antigen tests and lab tests (also known as P.C.R. tests) is sort of like comparing an X-ray to an M.R.I. scan. Both tests are reliable, serve unique purposes and can be useful at different times. The advantage of an X-ray is that it’s cheap, fast and pretty good at spotting obvious problems. An M.R.I. takes much longer and costs a lot more but gives you a more precise look at what’s going on in the body. The advantage of rapid antigen tests, whether they are taken at home or at a testing center, is that they are fast, relatively cheap and are highly reliable for telling you right now if you’re spreading the virus. A P.C.R. test is more sensitive and will identify an infection sooner, but it takes more time to get the result. Both tests are useful, but with a fast-spreading variant like Omicron, a rapid test can prompt someone to isolate a few days sooner, sparing others from your germs. Home tests can tell you whether you are infected with coronavirus right now. So you should test as close as possible to the time of the gathering, preferably about an hour or two before everyone gets together, advises Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. Dr. Michael Mina, a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer for eMed, a company that distributes at-home tests, advises an even tighter testing window. He suggests you take the test in your car just 15 minutes before the event, if that’s practical. While it’s important to test on the same day of the event, if you have extra time or extra tests, two tests over a few days are better than one. A few days before your party, try getting a lab test or take a rapid test, and then make sure you test again on the day of the event. A negative test does not lower your risk to zero. But taking a test does significantly reduce the risk that someone at your gathering will transmit the virus. “A test will not protect you from getting infected,” said Dr. Mina. “A test will protect you from infecting other people.” If you’re flying or taking a train, you should test the day you travel to make sure you’re not infecting your fellow passengers. Once you arrive, you should test in two or three days to make sure you didn’t pick up the virus during your travels. The most important precaution is that everyone at the party who is eligible be fully vaccinated and have a booster shot. But since even vaccinated people can spread Omicron, rapid testing a few hours before an event adds another layer of protection and can prevent an infected person from unknowingly spreading the virus at the gathering. But if you can’t find rapid home tests, everyone should try to get a lab test as close as possible to the event, timing it so you get the results back before you see everyone. “Any test is better than no test,” said Mara Aspinall, an expert in biomedical diagnostics at Arizona State University who is also on the board of OraSure, which makes rapid Covid tests. Limit other activities and try to isolate as you wait for the lab results so you don’t get infected in the interim. If everyone at the party can’t get tested, then you’ll need to assess the risk. If all the partygoers are relatively young and healthy, and everyone has been vaccinated and boosted, the risk of gathering is relatively low. But if a vulnerable person — someone very old or who has significant health risks — will be at the party, you may decide to scale it back or cancel if everyone can’t be tested. If you decide to gather without testing, consider asking everyone to wear masks, and focus on ventilation by opening windows or getting a HEPA air cleaner. If you’re in a warm area, try taking activities outside. “If you can’t get tests, you have to decide how much risk you’re willing to take,” said Dr. Robert Wachter, professor and chairman of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “Would I still get together if I couldn’t find a test? In a relatively low risk situation, with everyone boosted and vaccinated and everyone feels fine, I probably would. If someone is at high risk and I couldn’t get a test, I think I’d be inclined to have people wear masks and keep the windows open. I’d do the best I could to keep everyone as safe as possible.” Omicron moves fast, and many public health experts say people with potential exposures to the virus should test sooner than advised for previous variants. The current guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says vaccinated people don’t have to quarantine if they have had close contact with someone who has Covid-19, but that they should get tested five days later. Testing experts, however, say that’s probably not soon enough for Omicron. A recent outbreak of Omicron Covid infections in Norway after a holiday office party in November gives us clues about the best time to test based on how quickly an Omicron exposure can “convert” to an infection, said Dr. Wachter. The party was held in a restaurant on a Friday, and everyone was vaccinated. Of 80 confirmed and suspected cases, nearly 75 percent were detected on the Sunday, Monday and Tuesday after the party. That suggests that the best times to test are on days 2, 3 and 4 after exposure. So if you think you’ve been exposed to an infected person, or you’ve been traveling through airports and are worried that you picked up the virus, the best time to start testing is probably on day 2 and 3 after the event. If you can, test daily or every other day at least through day 6. And if you know you were exposed to an infected person, it’s a good idea to limit your contacts and mask up around others for about a week after the exposure. Yes. Don’t test immediately after an exposure or high-risk gathering and assume you are in the clear, since it can take a few days for the virus to reach detectable levels. “Doing it too soon is like a pregnancy test,” said Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos, a pulmonary and critical care medicine physician at Johns Hopkins Medicine. “If you test too soon, it means nothing.” The advice changes if you already are experiencing Covid symptoms. In that case, you should get tested right away. Try taking a rapid test on the day symptoms start, and if that’s negative, take another test a few days later. If your first test is negative after you’ve had a known exposure (or attended a high-risk gathering), you should test again two or three days later, taking precautions in the interim. No. If you start to feel Covid symptoms, especially if you live in an area with high case numbers, you should assume that you have the virus, at least until you’ve tested negative at least twice over a few days. Early symptoms in a vaccinated person may be a sign that the body is fighting the virus, and it’s possible the viral load isn’t yet high enough to turn a rapid test positive. “Take symptoms seriously,” said Dr. Mina. “Our bodies are giving us an early warning signal.” If you have symptoms and your rapid home test is negative, it’s still a good idea to try getting a lab-based P.C.R. test, which may find the virus sooner. If that test is also negative, it’s unlikely you have Covid. But if you have any respiratory symptoms, you still should stay home. In addition to Covid, you can also ask to be tested for two other potentially serious viral illnesses — influenza (the flu) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) — which are also circulating. While it’s unclear how often it happens, some people who get tested for Covid at a hospital or testing center receive an “indeterminate” test result. If this happens to you, you should not assume you are negative. You should retake the test, at a different testing site if possible. Indeterminate results happen for a variety reasons. Sometimes the sample itself is inadequate for testing. In some cases, a mistake in processing or a machine calibration issue can lead to an indeterminate result. And sometimes it happens because the patient’s viral load is so low, it doesn’t create a true positive result. If your rapid test is positive, you should assume that you have Covid. If you have reason to doubt the result, you can take a second test. False positives aren’t common, but they can happen. Most experts say they would isolate after a positive rapid test, but they would also get a confirmatory test from a lab. Getting the confirming lab test means your positive result will be documented in your medical records, which could speed things along if a patient needs additional treatments or develops Covid-related health issues in the future. It’s possible to test negative on a rapid test and test positive on a P.C.R. test. Both results may be correct, even if they disagree. The reason is that the tests are looking for different things. Rapid tests look for antigens indicating you’re infectious. A negative test indicates you’re not spreading coronavirus right now. A lab-based P.C.R. test is more sensitive and can tell you sooner if you’ve been infected with coronavirus. It’s possible for a P.C.R. test to detect coronavirus when you’re not infectious.  If you test positive on a rapid antigen test, and later test negative on a P.C.R. test, you probably don’t have Covid, said Dr. Jha. In this case, the rapid test likely was a false positive. If you have respiratory symptoms and get conflicting test results, it’s worth getting a third lab test a day or two later to break the tie. “If you’re testing in the context of symptoms, and you have a positive test on either one, then I would take them seriously and consider them positive, and not be reassured by the negative one,” said Dr. Paul Sax, an infectious disease expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School. If you’ve received conflicting test results and are not able to get a third test to break the tie, you should still take protective actions to prevent spreading the illness, said Tara Kirk Sell, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Virus tests all use a sample collected from the nose, throat or mouth that may be sent away to a lab or processed within minutes at home. An antigen test hunts for pieces of coronavirus proteins. Most rapid home antigen tests work sort of like a pregnancy test — if virus antigens are detected in the sample, a line on a paper test strip turns dark. The tests are highly reliable for telling you if you’re spreading the virus on the day you take the test, but a single test won’t tell you that you definitely don’t have coronavirus. The main advantage of the test is that it’s fast, and can be used to lower the risk of small indoor gatherings. A laboratory molecular test, also known as the P.C.R., or polymerase chain reaction, test, uses a technique that looks for bits of the virus’s genetic material — similar to a detective looking for DNA at a crime scene. This test is considered the gold standard of coronavirus testing because of its ability to detect even very small amounts of viral material. A positive result from a P.C.R. test almost certainly means you’re infected with the virus. The downside is that the typical turnaround time is one to three days, and during the current Omicron surge, people seeking tests are waiting in long lines and some centers are running out of tests. Some lab tests use a nasopharyngeal swab that is inserted deep (and uncomfortably) into the nasal cavity. Home tests typically rely on a nasal swab that collects a sample with a few easy swishes inside both nostrils. And some tests use a collection method that requires the patient to drool or spit into a test tube. For some people it might take about five minutes to generate enough spit to fill the vial, and testing sites ask you to not eat or drink anything 30 minutes before collecting a saliva sample. Saliva tests are slightly less accurate than nasal swabs, but the difference isn’t that meaningful, said Dr. Adam Ratner, director of pediatric infectious diseases at NYU Langone Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital. As long as the tests are cleared by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization, it doesn’t matter which brand you get, said Dr. Ratner. At-home tests can be purchased at most major drugstores, though Walgreens and CVS announced on Wednesday they’re limiting the number of test kits per purchase at locations nationwide amid a surge in demand. Currently, there are several rapid home antigen tests available in the United States. The best known include Abbott’s BinaxNOW, Quidel’s QuickVue and the recently authorized test by Acon Labs, Flowflex. Newer tests on the market include the Intrivo On/Go, the iHealth Covid-19 test and the BD Veritor at-home digital test kit. The InteliSwab test has the longest wait time, at 30 to 40 minutes. Australia’s Ellume has been in the news for a high rate of false positives, but those faulty tests have been recalled. Most of the tests are typically packaged two per box, although Flowflex offers a single test pack for about $10. Read the label before you buy. Some of the tests require an app. A more expensive home test, called a rapid home molecular test, uses a technology similar to what you might get at the doctor’s office. While a molecular test is more sensitive, these tests can also be hard to find and are expensive, so they aren’t a practical option for most people to use regularly. The Lucira Check It test kit costs $75 and takes about 30 minutes. A new test, Detect, offers a $75 starter kit that includes a reusable “hub” that processes the test in about an hour. Additional Detect tests cost $49 each, but the tests are often sold out. Another test called Cue offers subscription plans that include a $149 test reader and a $49 monthly subscription that includes 10 tests a year and discounts on future tests. The Biden administration has said it will release rules by Jan. 15 outlining an insurance reimbursement process for rapid home tests. It is unclear if the government will limit reimbursements per person. It does not appear reimbursement for Covid tests will be allowed for tests purchased before the rules are in place, but keep your receipts just in case. Some employer-sponsored health plans have been covering the costs of home tests for the last year, so check with your plan to make sure you’re not already eligible for reimbursement."

About 75,000 people received the mistaken payments, including many customers of rival banks. Santander is seeking help from the other banks to recoup the money, the bank said in a statement. The mistaken deposits could look like normal payments to recipients because they were duplicates of regular and one-off payments that about 2,000 of the bank’s commercial and corporate customers had already paid to people including their suppliers and employees. Santander said the money for those second payments did not come from its customers. “We’re sorry that due to a technical issue, some payments from our corporate clients were incorrectly duplicated on the recipients’ accounts,” the bank said. “None of our clients were at any point left out of pocket as a result, and we will be working hard with many banks across the U.K. to recover the duplicated transactions over the coming days.” People with accounts at dozens of banks, including Barclays, HSBC and Virgin Money, were among those who received the erroneous payments, according to The Times of London, which reported on the mistake on Thursday. To recoup the money, Santander UK has asked the banks where people received the payments to help retrieve the money. Santander UK said it was also using its own processes for recovering money that was paid in error. It was not clear how the banks would deal with customers who had already spent the money. Santander UK, the British arm of Banco Santander of Spain, has more than 14.4 million customers. The British operation reported profits of about $929 million (£687 million) before taxes in the third quarter of this year, up from £151 million in the same period in 2020. In May, the bank apologized after a “technical problem” left some customers unable to use banking services, including making payments, for several hours. It is rare for banks to deposit millions in error, but such mistakes can be the most costly for those who receive the money by mistake. In April, a 911 dispatcher was arrested on fraud and theft charges after she bought a house and an S.U.V. using some of the $1.2 million that the financial services company Charles Schwab had accidentally deposited in her brokerage account. In February 2008, two sisters from Blackburn, England, were jailed after they spent nearly £135,000 that a bank accidentally deposited in one of their accounts."

The desperately needed snow arrived too late to save 991 homes that were destroyed as a wildfire fueled by hurricane-force wind gusts roared through parched grasses and into suburban cul-de-sacs in the suburbs of Louisville and Superior, just outside the college town of Boulder. And in a discouraging reversal, law-enforcement officials announced on Saturday that they were now searching for three people feared dead inside their burned-out homes. Immediately after the fire, officials had said there were no reports of deaths. Now, with snow hindering the search efforts, Sheriff Joe Pelle of Boulder County said the county would bring in cadaver-finding dogs to search for victims. “Potentially there are human remains in those homes,” he said. “It’s not even safe to step into the scene. We don’t know what’s underneath.” Sheriff Pelle said investigators looking into the cause of the fire had served a search warrant after receiving several tips, but he did not offer any additional details. Officials had first suggested power lines as a potential cause, but on Saturday they said they had determined there were no downed electric lines near the fire’s point of origin. “If it turns out to be arson or reckless behavior, we’ll take appropriate actions,” the sheriff said. Family members identified one of the missing people as Nadine Turnbull, 91, telling 9News that a relative had tried to rescue her from her home in Superior only to be turned back by flames engulfing the front and back doors. As thousands of surviving homes remained without power and gas on Saturday, the seven-degree temperatures and the 10 inches of snow that fell on the Boulder area touched off a frantic new battle against the weather. It came as President Biden approved a disaster declaration for the fire zone, opening up new sources of federal aid. Residents hiked into their neighborhoods to drain their pipes and empty hot-water tanks. They scrambled to set up space heaters. People on vacation hundreds of miles away pleaded for help in shutting off the water at their homes and opening up their taps to prevent a flood. Nearly 13,000 households around Boulder were without natural gas on Saturday, and 7,500 households still had no power, according to Xcel Energy, the local provider. The company said that electricity would be restored later on Saturday but that natural gas would take several days. The Town of Superior said it was shutting off water in the fire zone on Saturday to prevent additional damage. “This is disappointment on disappointment,” said Alli Bowdey, a nurse whose family fled its Louisville home and was packed into a house with relatives. On top of everything else, her husband tested positive for the coronavirus and was isolating in a hotel on Saturday. “We just looked at each other in disbelief,” she said. In the Sans Souci mobile home park, Robert Guokas, 83, was trying to stay warm with a propane heater and warming water on a camp stove as he bundled up in sleeping bags and layers of clothing collected over the years from Army surplus stores. But as much as his long-ago time as a Boy Scout had prepared him for this emergency, he was starting to run low on propane by Saturday. “That’s going to stretch my limit,” he said, but he worried that leaving for an emergency shelter would be even worse than staying home. By staying put, he could try to minimize the damage, for instance by replacing the pots he had set up to catch the water dripping through his roof after the harsh winds on Thursday tore part of it off. “You leave it for three or four days or a week, and it becomes a derelict — it becomes unfixable,” Mr. Guokas said. The damage from a burst pipe could be so severe that it would be cheaper to find a new mobile home than to make repairs on his decades-old unit. But with his income of just $1,400 a month from Social Security, he has no idea how he would afford either. As the scale of the destruction came into clearer view on Saturday, thousands of displaced people across the Boulder area began to confront questions about whether they would rebuild and how they would find temporary housing in a region confronting a stark shortage of homes and an affordability crisis that has already priced many young families out of Louisville and Superior. Even as Ms. Bowdey’s husband, a property manager, fights off Covid-19 at a hotel, he has been inundated with 200 requests for housing from families who now have no place to go, she said, adding, “It kind of hits you every so often that this is not just weeks and months — this is years.” Clint Folsom, the mayor of Superior, said that finding long-term housing for so many families was the next emergency. While his home survived the fire, his 76-year-old mother’s home burned to the ground, as did two homes his sister-in-law owns. “We’ve got hundreds and hundreds of people who are going to need housing,” Mr. Folsom said. “That’s going to be the challenge.” But residents said they were anxious about whether to rebuild in a suburb that felt newly vulnerable to the devastating effects of a warmer, drier climate in the Mountain West. If their suburban blocks and the neighborhood hotel and Target store were vulnerable to fires, where was safe? “This is a new world we’re living in,” said Jennifer Balch, the director of the Earth Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder. “We need to completely rethink where homes are at risk.” The community’s most urgent needs were clear on Saturday outside a Y.M.C.A. in the nearby town of Lafayette that had been converted into a Red Cross shelter. Thirty cars idled outside in single-digit temperatures, waiting for volunteers handing out portable heaters and bottled water. Inside were roughly 120 people who had sought shelter, many of them still unsure if their homes were standing. Pat Wilhelm, 66, had to rebuild much of his home after a 2013 electrical fire, and as he sat inside the evacuation site, he said he was still waiting on word of whether his house had survived this blaze. “If it’s there, it’s there,” he said. “If it’s not, you deal with it.” Nicolas and Katie Ferrington were among the residents who now had an answer. Less than a year after they had finished building their four-bedroom “forever home” on a ridge in the Spanish Hills subdivision, it was gone. “It’s like a death,” said Mrs. Ferrington, 40, who owns a physical therapy business. “It’s a shock.” The Ferringtons planned to rebuild on the same spot but were worried about what their home insurance would cover, as their policy had been tied to the lower value of a structure they had demolished to build their new home. “We are viewing this as an opportunity to start over,” Mr. Ferrington said. But others were still just trying to process their losses and the road ahead. The scale of the devastation did not feel real to Eric Egaas, 18, until he and his mother reached the home where the family had lived for more than two decades, having moved in as other houses in their subdivision were still being built. By the time they got to the house, little was left apart from the patch of pavement where Mr. Egaas and his sister had pressed their hands into wet concrete as children. His mother, Korina Bersentes, said the family had not yet decided whether to rebuild. “I do fear that this is going to be the new norm in the West,” she said. “It’s not going to be wildfires in the mountains. It’s going to be wildfires everywhere.”"

He was 77. The cause was complications of dementia, according to a family statement. Reeves played and coached with the Dallas Cowboys during a stellar period when they won two Super Bowls, one when he was a player-coach and one when he was an offensive coordinator, working for Coach Tom Landry. After several seasons as an assistant to Landry, he was hired as the Broncos’ head coach in 1981, replacing Red Miller. Over 12 seasons in Denver, his teams had a record of 110-73-1 and were among the best in the American Football Conference. Led by quarterback John Elway, they lost the Super Bowl in 1987, 1988 and 1990 by wide margins to the New York Giants, the Washington Redskins and the San Francisco 49ers. Reeves clashed with Elway over the Broncos’ offensive scheme and disagreed with the team’s owner, Pat Bowlen, over control of the team. Reeves fired his offensive coordinator, Mike Shanahan, in early 1992 for insubordination, believing that Shanahan had driven a wedge between him and Elway, who would later say it was “hell” playing for Reeves. Following an 8-8 season in 1992, Bowlen fired Reeves. “When you own a football team,” Reeves said afterward, “you should be able to run the ball club the way you would like to.” Bowlen said that he could have renewed Reeves’s contract but that within a year “we both would have been miserable and at each other’s throat.” Reeves was hired in early 1993 by the Giants, who had dismissed Ray Handley after a 6-10 season. “When you’ve gone and lost three Super Bowls and that’s what people will remember the most about you, that’s what drives you,” Reeves said at the news conference where he was introduced. He had a promising start, leading the Giants to an 11-5 record and beating the Minnesota Vikings, 17-10, in the wild-card playoff game. But the Giants lost to the 49ers, 44-3, in a divisional playoff game. The Associated Press named him its coach of the year. The Giants did not make the playoffs over Reeves’ next three seasons — his Giants teams had a combined 20-28 record in that span — and he was fired in 1996. He had grown displeased with the limited amount of input he had on personnel decisions, and he had a testy relationship with some members of the Giants’ front office. “Everybody talks about a power struggle,” he said at a news conference after his firing. “It was more like a philosophy struggle.” He said that the team had lacked enough impact players and that some of the college players his staff suggested should have been drafted had been taken off the team’s list of potential draftees because they had not done well on psychological tests. It was not long before the Atlanta Falcons hired him, to replace June Jones after finishing the 1996 season with a 3-13 record. Daniel Edward Reeves was born on Jan. 19, 1944, in Rome, Ga., to Ann and Edward Reeves. The family moved to Americus, Ga., where he played high school football, basketball and baseball. At the University of South Carolina, he played quarterback from 1962 to 1964. Undrafted by any team in the N.F.L. or the American Football League, he signed in 1965 with the Cowboys, who converted him to a running back. He played eight seasons and accumulated 1,990 rushing yards, 757 of them in 1966, his best year. One of his career highlights occurred during the 1967 N.F.L. championship game, better known as the Ice Bowl because of the Arctic conditions at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis., where the Cowboys played the Packers in one of the league’s most epic contests. At the start of the fourth quarter, with the Packers ahead, 14-10, Reeves took a pitch from quarterback Don Meredith and threw a 50-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lance Rentzel. “When we pitched it out and I was running with the ball,” Reeves told NFL Films, “I noticed both the safety and corner coming up, which meant that Rentzel would be open.” He added, “When I threw it I thought I had a chance to overthrow it, but the wind was in our face and thank goodness it held it up.” The Packers came back to win, 21-17. In 1970, Landry made Reeves a backfield coach. He was still an active player at the time. “You think you’re pretty smart after a few years in the league as a player,” Reeves told The Associated Press before the 1970 season. “But you get into the coaching end and you realize how much work is involved in learning the game.” After coaching the Broncos and the Giants, Reeves took over the Falcons in 1997. Following a 7-9 first season, he quickly turned Atlanta into one of the best teams in the N.F.L. The team finished the following year with a 14-2 record; its star running back, Jamal Anderson, gained 1,846 yards. But as the Falcons were en route to their 12th victory, against the Saints in New Orleans in mid-December, Reeves felt a burning sensation in his chest and throat; a day later, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery. He missed the Falcons’ two final regular-season games, but he returned for a playoff run that led to the team’s appearance in the Super Bowl against the Broncos, a matchup between Reeves and Shanahan. The Broncos won, 34-19. Reeves was named A.P. coach of the year for a second time. But the Falcons were not the same in the ensuing years. Anderson tore up his knee early the next season. They had losing records in four of the next five seasons. With the team a dismal 3-10 in 2003, Reeves was fired with three games left in the season. “I’m am an eternal optimist, so yeah, it was a surprise,” he told reporters. “But I’m also realistic enough about coaching to understand this is how it is in the N.F.L.” Reeves’s survivors include his wife, Pam; his children, Lee, Laura and Dana, whose husband, Joe DeCamillis, is the special teams coordinator for the Los Angeles Rams; and six grandchildren. John Elway, now the Broncos’ president of football operations, released a statement after Reeves’s death. His old resentments appeared to have softened. “We may not have always seen eye to eye,” he said, “but the bottom line is we won a lot of games together. Looking back, what I appreciate about Dan is how he gradually brought me along to help me reach my potential.” Elway said that Reeves deserved to be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame for taking two teams to the Super Bowl. But the only Dan Reeves in the Hall is the one who once owned the Rams."

Kathy Hochul said in a statement announcing the state’s latest totals. “Wear a mask, wash your hands and take advantage of the best tool we have at our disposal — the vaccine.” New York is one of several hot spots — along with Washington, D.C., and other Eastern states — leading a national surge. On Thursday, a record 585,013 new cases were recorded nationwide, and hospitalizations are trending upward across much of the country. In the previous 24 hours in New York State, nearly 90,000 vaccine doses had been administered, according to Governor Hochul’s statement. Eighty-eight deaths in the state were attributed to Covid. Nationally, there were 1,181 Covid deaths recorded on Friday, according to a New York Times database. As recently as two weeks ago, a total of 21,000 positive tests in New York was enough to set an alarming record. The stunning recent increases in positivity rates, fueled at least in part by the highly transmissible Omicron variant, served as an unwelcome reminder that the pandemic was entering its third year. Although it involved substantially fewer cases, the U.S. winter surge around the same time last year crested on Jan. 12, suggesting that the country may have a week or more before this current wave reaches its peak. According to some testing experts, however, Omicron’s incubation period may be as short as 72 hours, which could accelerate this wave’s progression. Airlines had canceled more than 2,700 flights across the United States by Saturday evening, by far the worst day in the industry’s weeklong struggle with bad weather and crew shortages. The cancellations mounted amid reports of heavy snowfall across much of the nation’s midsection, and if the pattern of the last week holds, many more could be canceled by day’s end. The industry canceled thousands of trips, about 5.7 percent of all scheduled flights, in the week ending on Friday, according to FlightAware, an aviation data provider. Every major U.S. carrier made deep cuts on Saturday, too. Nearly half the cancellations were concentrated at Chicago’s two airports, where heavy snow and strong winds were expected throughout the day into Sunday. Southwest Airlines said it planned to suspend operations at those airports on Saturday afternoon. The airline cut over 470 flights nationwide, more than any other U.S. carrier, accounting for about 13 percent of its schedule. “As always, we have safety top-of-mind and, for us, that also means keeping people from driving to airports to wait on long-delayed flights whenever we can avoid that,” Southwest said in a statement. Delta Air Lines scrubbed 9 percent of scheduled trips, while American and United Airlines each cut 7 percent. In a statement, United, which has its headquarters in Chicago, said that the nationwide spike in coronavirus cases had affected its ability to staff flights, too. The cancellations contribute to a disappointing time for the industry, both to the end of the holiday season and to a convulsive year characterized by revival and setbacks. Widespread vaccinations early in 2021 gave way to a summer travel boom that was then stifled somewhat by the Delta virus variant. The industry recovery continued to build again in the fall, only to be slowed again by the Omicron variant. Millions of people have been flying daily within the United States this holiday season. But passenger traffic is still down 15 percent or more from 2019 on most days, according to Transportation Security Administration data. Despite the recent turmoil, U.S. carriers canceled 1.5 percent of scheduled flights in 2021 compared with 1.6 percent in 2019, according to FlightAware. As the Omicron variant of the coronavirus continues to fuel a nationwide surge, North Carolina is seeing a drastic increase in Covid-19 cases. The state has reported a 166 percent increase in infections in two weeks, according to a New York Times database, and some counties are struggling to keep up with testing demands. The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services reported that there were 19,174 new Covid-19 cases on Friday — a record high for the second straight day. On Thursday, the department said in a statement that it was the “highest one-day number of Covid-19 cases” with 18,571, which was 60 percent higher than the previous daily record of 11,581 set in January 2021 after a holiday surge. The current jump in infections is most likely driven by the highly transmittable Omicron variant, according to local reports. True case numbers are likely to be even higher, though, since at-home tests are not reported by the state. The department also said that hospitalizations in the state had nearly doubled since the beginning of December. The number of people visiting emergency rooms for “Covid-like illness” on Thursday also set a record with 4,171 visits. The department added that 89 percent of people in intensive care for Covid-19 in the state were unvaccinated. According to a New York Times database, intensive care units in North Carolina are 82 percent full. The average I.C.U. occupancy rate nationwide is 79 percent. Currently, only 57 percent of the state is fully vaccinated, trailing the national average, which is 62 percent. On Thursday, the Wayne County Health Department announced that it had run out of coronavirus tests and would have no tests available “until further notice.” “Demand for testing has increased significantly nationwide over the past two weeks, and additional test kits have been ordered from the state,” the department said. So far, the county has had the slowest rise in cases in the state. In New Hanover County, a testing drive thru on Thursday had to end early because the location ran out of tests, according to a statement from the county. Wake County, where the daily case count seems to be the highest in the state, announced on Saturday that although its testing sites would be open, there were no available appointments until Monday. The county had doubled its Covid-19 testing appointments to 13,000 daily slots last week “to help meet rapidly increasing community needs,” according to a statement. But the increase failed to meet demand. Universities in the state are also taking more precautions. Duke University will have remote instruction until Jan. 18, the university announced on Friday. Residence halls will open as planned on Sunday, but the university is asking students to delay their return until instruction resumes as normal. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is recommending that students and professors get booster shots when eligible and said it would announce any changes to on-campus operations by Monday. A cruise ship operated by a German line and carrying over 4,000 people has been held up in Lisbon after an outbreak of Covid-19 among its crew. The AIDAnova docked in Lisbon on Dec. 29 and was due to sail a day later toward the island of Madeira, in time to watch a New Year’s Eve fireworks display in the port of Funchal, the main town on the island. But its departure was canceled, and passengers started the year on the Portuguese mainland instead after 52 crew members tested positive for the coronavirus. The 52 crew members were taken ashore and were being kept isolated in various hotels in Lisbon. All were vaccinated and none are experiencing severe symptoms. The ship arrived in Lisbon with a crew of 1,353 and 2,844 passengers, most of them Germans, the director of the port of Lisbon, Diogo Vieira Branco, told Lusa, Portugal’s national news agency. The passengers were allowed to go ashore in Lisbon. AIDA Cruises, the German operator of the ship, could not immediately be reached for comment. But the line told the German news agency DPA that it was trying to find fresh crew members before deciding whether it could resume its itinerary. The ship was set to sail next to the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago off the northwestern coast of Africa. Earlier in December, another German operator, Tui, was forced to cut short a trip because of a coronavirus outbreak on one of its ships, Mein Schiff 4, which had docked in Las Palmas, the largest city in the Canary Islands. Registered in Italy, the AIDAnova was launched in 2018 as the world’s first cruise ship powered entirely by liquefied natural gas. On its website, AIDA Cruises specifies that all passengers must be tested for the coronavirus before boarding and that further tests can be required depending on the cruise. CAPE TOWN — In an almost empty cathedral, with an unvarnished, rope-handled coffin placed before the altar, South Africa said farewell on Saturday to Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu with the simplicity that he had planned. Archbishop Tutu’s death last Sunday at age 90 was followed by a week of mourning, as the world remembered his powerful role both in opposing apartheid and in promoting unity and reconciliation after its defeat. But his funeral in a rain-soaked Cape Town, where pandemic regulations limited attendance to 100 and discouraged crowds outside, was far more subdued than the packed stadiums and parade of dignitaries that mourned South Africa’s other Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Nelson Mandela. It was exactly what the archbishop had wanted. A hymn sung in his mother tongue, Setswana; Mozart’s “Laudate Dominum”; and a sermon delivered by an old friend were all part of what Archbishop Tutu intended for his requiem Mass, celebrated at St. George’s Cathedral. There would be no official speeches beyond the eulogy, and the only military presence allowed at the funeral of a man who once said, “I am a man of peace, but not a pacifist,” came when an officer brought South Africa’s national flag to be handed to his widow, Nomalizo Leah Tutu. The coronavirus pandemic further scaled down proceedings. With a limited guest list, the only international heads of state in attendance had a close relationship with the archbishop, like King Letsie III of Lesotho, who spent time with the Tutu family as a child at a boarding school in England. A former president of Ireland, Mary Robinson, read one of the prayers during the requiem Mass. With singing discouraged in closed spaces to reduce the spread of the virus, the choir performed in an adjacent hall. In the week leading up to the funeral, those who were close with Archbishop Tutu said that as he became increasingly frail, they saw a man distressed by South Africa’s enduring social and economic inequality. In the past two years, the pandemic and resulting lockdowns have further deepened poverty, bringing unemployment to record levels. Under Covid-19 restrictions, at a public viewing site erected in the Grand Parade, Cape Town’s main public square, barely 100 people gathered to watch the service on a big screen. Those who braved the rain said they wanted to say goodbye to a “great man,” like Laurence and Joslyn Vlotman, who brought an umbrella and small camp stool. But many, like Meg Jordi, sat on the ground. Michael Jatto, a British national on vacation in South Africa from England, took his two daughters to the square to learn about the archbishop — “for us as Africans, for our children to see a great man being shown in a positive light.” SEOUL — Kim Jong-un has begun his second decade as North Korea’s leader with a vow to alleviate the country’s chronic food shortages, state media reported on Saturday. The shortages have been worsened by the coronavirus pandemic and international sanctions against his nuclear weapons program. Mr. Kim, 37, presided over a five-day meeting this week of North Korea’s ruling Workers’ Party, ​which drew more attention than usual because it came at the end of his first decade in power. On ​Saturday, New Year’s Day, the North’s state media carried lengthy reports on the meeting. They mentioned no diplomatic overtures from Mr. Kim toward the United States or South Korea, and only a brief reiteration of his frequent promise to increase the North’s military power. But much space was devoted to the subject of food shortages, which many analysts see as the biggest shortcoming of Mr. Kim’s leadership. One of the first promises that Mr. Kim made after inheriting power from his father, Kim Jong-il, a decade ago was that long-suffering North Koreans would “never have to tighten their belt again.” But that goal has remained elusive. Several months ago, Mr. Kim issued a rare warning that the North faced a “tense” food situation. At the party meeting that ended on Friday, Mr. Kim pledged to “increase the agricultural production and completely solve the food problem,” specifying production goals “to be attained phase by phase in the coming 10 years,” the North’s Korean Central News Agency said. But Mr. Kim did not appear to introduce any significant agricultural measures​, except to forgive all cooperative farms’ debts to the government.  Mr. Kim also called it a “top priority” to tighten loopholes in the North’s campaign against the pandemic. North Korea has claimed that it had no Covid-19 cases, and it has rejected offers of millions of vaccine doses, leaving its population vulnerable to explosive outbreaks should its borders reopen.  There are no signs that North Korea is in danger of the kind of devastating famine that it suffered in the late 1990s. But its grain production totaled ​only ​4.69 million tons this year, leaving a shortage of 800,000 tons, according to estimates released this month by South Korea’s Rural Development Administration. In July, the United States Department of Agriculture ​estimated that ​16.3 million people in the North — 63.1 percent of the population​ — were “food insecure.” ​In the past, North Korea has made up for its agricultural shortfalls with foreign aid and imports. But in response to the pandemic, it has rejected outside aid and shut its borders, making it harder to import fertilizers or farm equipment from neighboring China​, the North’s only major trading partner and donor​. Pandemic restrictions have also hurt the country’s unofficial markets, which helped circulate food. Eric Leroy Adams was sworn in as the 110th mayor of New York City early Saturday in a festive but pared-down Times Square ceremony, a signal of the formidable task before him as he begins his term while coronavirus cases are surging anew. Mr. Adams, 61, the son of a house cleaner who was a New York City police captain before entering politics, has called himself “the future of the Democratic Party,” and pledged to address longstanding inequities as the city’s “first blue-collar mayor,” while simultaneously embracing the business community. Yet not since 2002, when Michael R. Bloomberg took office shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, has an incoming mayor confronted such daunting challenges in New York City. Even before the latest Omicron-fueled surge, the city’s economy was still struggling to recover, with its 9.4 percent unemployment rate more than double the national average. Murders, shootings and some other categories of violent crimes rose early in the pandemic and have remained higher than before the virus began to spread. Mr. Adams’s first task as mayor, however, will be to help New Yorkers navigate the Omicron variant and a troubling spike in cases. The city has recorded over 40,000 cases per day in recent days, and the number of hospitalizations is growing. The city’s testing system, once the envy of the nation, has struggled to meet demand and long lines form outside testing sites. Concerns over the virus caused some rejiggering of inauguration plans: Alvin Bragg, the first Black person to hold the office of Manhattan district attorney, postponed his inauguration ceremony to March 6 because of Covid concerns; he took the oath in a private ceremony after midnight. Mr. Adams canceled his inauguration ceremony indoors at Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, which was meant to be a tribute to the voters outside Manhattan who elected him. Instead, Mr. Adams chose the backdrop of the ball-drop crowd, which itself had been limited for distancing purposes to just a quarter of the usual size. Still, his swearing-in ceremony in Times Square, shortly after the ceremonial countdown, was jubilant, and the new mayor said he was hopeful about the city’s future. “Trust me, we’re ready for a major comeback because this is New York,” Mr. Adams said, standing among the revelers earlier in the night. The United States is in the midst of a case spike averaging more than 300,000 new cases a day for the first time in the pandemic as holiday gatherings and travel coupled with the proliferation of the highly transmissible Omicron variant have propelled a surge across the country. On Dec. 30, there was a daily average of 378,516 positive coronavirus cases, a 201 percent increase in the last two weeks, according to a New York Times database. Daily counts increased by 100,000 or more on three days running in the last week. Hospitalizations rose 25 percent in two weeks. As the Omicron variant speeds through communities around the country, many more people, including those who have been vaccinated, will test positive for the coronavirus. Some projections forecast millions of new cases in the next week. Here’s what you should know: Some symptom differences between Omicron and other variants have emerged from preliminary data, but experts are not certain they are meaningful. Data released from South Africa suggest that South Africans with Omicron often develop a scratchy or sore throat along with nasal congestion, a dry cough and muscle pain, especially low back pain. Meanwhile, the Delta variant is still spreading as well. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most common Covid symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache, a loss of the sense of taste or smell and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. If you are feeling sick, get tested immediately. You can be infected without showing symptoms, and could spread the virus to others, even if you are vaccinated. It is always better to get tested for the coronavirus, especially to try to halt the spread of Omicron. Given the high spread rates in recent weeks, if you have gone to a large gathering it is probably better to get tested. The current guidance from the C.D.C. says vaccinated people don’t have to quarantine if they have had close contact with someone who has Covid, but that they should get tested five days later. Testing experts, however, say that’s probably not soon enough for Omicron, whose incubation period may be as short as 72 hours. Experts say that the best times to test are on Days 2, 3 and 4 after exposure. There are several testing options. You can test at home with a rapid test purchased from a pharmacy, or you can go get a P.C.R. test at a lab. If you tested positive after taking a rapid home test, you may want to take a second home test using a different brand or go to a testing center to confirm the result. If you’re in public or around people when you receive the news, put on a mask immediately. Then isolate yourself as quickly as possible, even if you don’t have symptoms. Last week, the C.D.C slashed the isolation period from 10 to five days for those without symptoms or those without fevers for 24 hours whose other symptoms were resolving. Americans leaving isolation should wear masks around others for an additional five days after their isolation periods have ended, officials said. Some experts, though, have called the new guidelines “reckless” and have suggested to isolate for longer. To calculate your isolation window, the C.D.C. advises that you consider Day 1 to be the first full day after you develop symptoms. If you didn’t have symptoms, Day 1 is the first full day after your positive test. Even as coronavirus cases were shooting up at a dizzying pace in the United States this week, scientific evidence arrived providing hope for those who fall ill because of the Omicron variant — and for countries, states and communities battling its surge. People infected with Omicron were about half as likely to be hospitalized as those with the Delta variant, according to a report from British health officials, and they were only one-third as likely to need emergency care. However, even though risk may be reduced on an individual level, Omicron is still expected to cause further strain on health care systems simply because of the enormous numbers of people it is and will be infecting. The report, issued by the U.K. Health Security Agency, also showed that vaccination offers strong protection against Covid’s worst outcomes. The risk of hospitalization in Omicron cases was 65 percent lower in people who had received two doses, compared with the unvaccinated, and 81 percent lower in those who had gotten boosters. Based on 528,176 Omicron cases and 573,012 Delta cases, the report is one of the largest real-world examinations of Omicron infections to date. Several recent studies on lab animals and human tissues have offered a possible explanation for Omicron’s milder effects: It often concentrates in the nose, throat and windpipe, rather than damaging the lungs, as previous variants did. More good news came in the form of a laboratory study from South African scientists suggesting that people who have recovered from an Omicron infection may be able to repel infections by the Delta variant. If Omicron outcompetes Delta, that could mean a future with fewer hospitalizations and deaths, making it easier for humanity to coexist with the virus. Parents received some reassurance this week, as well. While there has been an increase in hospitalizations among children during Omicron’s advance, that appears to simply reflect the vast increase overall in infections. Doctors and researchers said that they were not seeing evidence that the variant was harder on children than previous versions of the virus. Preliminary data says that Omicron is actually milder in children, as has been the case with adults. Also, one report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine showed that serious problems among children ages 5 to 11 who had received it were extremely rare, and another found that nearly all serious illnesses in a group of hundreds of pediatric hospitalizations occurred in children who had not been fully vaccinated. In the bigger picture, the new year dawned with reasons for hope. Omicron will exact a toll, but after it does, more people will have Covid immunity. And newly approved post-infection treatments from Merck and Pfizer have the potential to make Covid a far less deadly disease. In other science news: The new year is here and has brought the Omicron-driven virus wave along with it. More than 3.5 million people worldwide died from the coronavirus in 2021, almost twice as many as in 2020. The Delta variant wreaked havoc around the world, and now the Omicron variant, which has already become dominant in the United States, is fueling a spike in cases. Omicron has spread to more than 100 countries after it was first identified in Botswana and South Africa in late November, infecting previously vaccinated people as well as those who have previously been infected. But South African officials say their country has now crested its Omicron wave, and new cases are falling, all without a major increase in deaths — offering hope that, while other countries may see similar weeks of intensity, they may also see drop-offs and fewer deaths than in previous waves.  For the United States, the coming weeks look difficult. “We’ll be in for a tough January, as cases will keep going up and peak, and then fall fast,” said Ali Mokdad, a University of Washington epidemiologist who is a former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientist. While virus cases will still overwhelm hospitals, he said, he expects that the proportion of cases resulting in hospitalization will be lower than in earlier waves. Studies in animals suggest that Omicron does not invade the lungs as readily, which may help explain its generally lessened severity.  New estimates from researchers at Columbia University suggest that the United States could peak by Jan. 9 at around 2.5 million cases per week, though that number may go as high as 5.4 million. In New York City, the first U.S. metropolis to see a major surge, the researchers estimated that cases would peak by the first week of the new year. “It’s shocking. It’s disturbing,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist who led the Columbia modeling work. “We’re seeing unprecedented numbers of Covid-19 cases.” At the same time, Dr. Shaman said, there is a possibility that as cases fall in areas now experiencing major Omicron surges, other areas currently less affected will see their own Omicron surges, leading to a more rounded case curve nationally. The country’s hottest spots now are mostly clustered in the eastern half of the country.  The United States set a single-day record with 489,000 cases on Wednesday, and then broke the record again on Thursday when it tallied 582,000 cases, according to a New York Times database. The number of new cases fell from those record numbers on Friday, when many states did not report data on New Year’s Eve. But the tally was still exceptionally high, with 443,000 new cases in just 28 states. Even the staggering numbers from the past several days are undercounts, as the holiday season causes major distortions in testing and data reporting. The growing use of at-home tests makes the accounting even more questionable. Genome sequencing shows that Omicron has exponential growth because some of its dozens of mutations appear to speed up transmission. But new studies, including one that surveyed one million coronavirus patients in England, support research that shows that two doses of vaccines are offering significant protection against severe disease, even though Omicron has been consistently better at evading vaccines. Doctors are urging anyone who is unvaccinated to get their first vaccine dose as soon as possible, and anyone who is inoculated to get a booster shot. “We are all tired and ready for this to be over,” said Dr. Brian Garibaldi, clinical lead of the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. “But we still have a lot of work to do and a long way to go.” At Sea Crest Nursing and Rehabilitation, a large nursing home that looks out on the Coney Island boardwalk, more than 100 residents have died of Covid-19 since the pandemic began. Yet as the Omicron variant surges to a new high in New York, the nursing home is struggling to provide what medical experts believe is one of the strongest forms of protection against this latest wave of the virus: a booster shot. Of the 274 residents of the nursing home, only 52 — fewer than one in five — had received a booster, according to state data from this past week. Vaccine hesitancy among residents or their families, and residents being ineligible because they recently received second vaccine doses or monoclonal antibodies, are among the causes of the low booster rates at Sea Crest and other nursing homes. But as Omicron spreads, health experts point to an additional problem: New York, like much of the country, was slow to push boosters before the variant arrived just a few weeks ago, and has largely left administering third doses to the long-term care facilities themselves, some of which are struggling with the task. Now, with Omicron spreading rapidly in almost every region, health experts are calling on the city and state to do more to ensure that the most vulnerable — particularly nursing home residents — get boosters quickly. “The city and state should be working together to try to make sure everyone in nursing homes is boosted,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, a former city health commissioner and a former C.D.C. director. He called nursing homes “ground zero for Covid.”"

Tutu with the simplicity that he had planned. Archbishop Tutu’s death last Sunday at age 90 was followed by a week of mourning, as the world remembered his powerful role both in opposing apartheid and in promoting unity and reconciliation after its defeat. But his funeral in a rain-soaked Cape Town, where pandemic regulations limited attendance to 100 and discouraged crowds outside, was far more subdued than the packed stadiums and parade of dignitaries that mourned South Africa’s other Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Nelson Mandela. It was exactly what the archbishop had wanted. A hymn sung in his mother tongue, Setswana; Mozart’s “Laudate Dominum”; and a sermon delivered by an old friend were all part of what Archbishop Tutu designed for his requiem Mass, celebrated at St. George’s Cathedral. There would be no official speeches beyond the eulogy, and the only military presence allowed at the funeral of a man who once said, “I am a man of peace, but not a pacifist,” came when an officer brought South Africa’s national flag to be handed to his widow, Nomalizo Leah Tutu. The coronavirus pandemic further scaled down proceedings. With a limited guest list, the only international heads of state in attendance had a close relationship with the archbishop, like King Letsie III of Lesotho, who spent time with the Tutu family as a child at a boarding school in England. A former president of Ireland, Mary Robinson, read one of the prayers during the requiem Mass. With singing discouraged in closed spaces to reduce the spread of the virus, the choir performed in an adjacent hall. “Desmond was not on some crusade of personal aggrandizement or egotism,” said the friend who delivered the sermon, Michael Nuttall, who as bishop of Natal in the 1980s and 1990s became known as “Tutu’s No. 2.” He described their relationship, as the first Black archbishop of Cape Town and his white deputy, as a precursor “of what could be in our wayward, divided nation.” Archbishop Tutu “loved to be loved,” though, recalled Bishop Nuttall, and this was the enduring image of the diminutive man in flowing clerical robes: a dynamic leader who joked and scolded with equal gusto. The activist archbishop was at the forefront of the struggle against apartheid. Outside South Africa, he campaigned for international sanctions as he preached about the injustices that Black South Africans suffered under the segregationist regime. At home, he presided over dozens of funerals of young activists killed as the country’s townships resembled a war zone in the final years of apartheid. After the country’s first democratic election in 1994, he led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and christened the “new” South Africa the “rainbow nation” as he tried to shepherd its citizens toward national healing. In the nearly three decades since the end of apartheid, he continued to speak out against the corruption and inequality that sullied that ideal. “When he first spoke about us as a ‘rainbow nation,’ South Africa was a different place and were going through a very difficult time,” President Cyril Ramaphosa said in his eulogy. “He has left us at another difficult time in the life of our nation.” In the week leading up to the funeral, those who were close with Archbishop Tutu said that as he became increasingly frail, they saw a man distressed by South Africa’s enduring social and economic inequality. In the past two years, the coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have further exacerbated poverty, bringing unemployment to record levels. Under Covid-19 restrictions, at a public viewing site erected in the Grand Parade, Cape Town’s main public square, barely 100 people gathered to watch the service on a big screen. Those who braved the rain said they wanted to say goodbye to a “great man,” like Laurence and Joslyn Vlotman, who brought an umbrella and small camp stool. But many, like Meg Jordi, sat on the ground. Michael Jatto, a British national on vacation in South Africa from England, took his two daughters to the square to learn about the archbishop — “for us as Africans, for our children to see a great man being shown in a positive light.” For many South Africans who attended Christian and interfaith services in the days leading up to the funeral, there was a collective sense that South Africa had lost its moral compass. Some, though, found hope in the renewed focus on Archbishop Tutu’s life and legacy. “I feel we’ve gained in the way that the country, the government, the church has magnified him and held him up,” said Nikki Lomba, who watched from behind a barrier with her mother, Brita Lomba, as the archbishop’s coffin was driven away in a hearse. “I feel we’ve gained more hope, and at a very pivotal moment learned a lot in his passing.”"

It’s distracting and irritating. How do I get it to stop? And should I be concerned? Eyelid spasms, while annoying, are “rarely a sign of something serious,” said Stephanie Erwin, an optometrist at Cleveland Clinic’s Cole Eye Institute. The most common type of eye twitch is a series of muscle contractions called eyelid myokymia, which produces involuntary and intermittent contractions of the eyelid, typically the lower one. Only one eye is affected at a time because the twitch originates in the muscle surrounding the eye, and not the nerve that controls the blink reflex, which sends the same message to both eyes simultaneously, Dr. Erwin added. The spasms can last from hours to days to months. “If the twitching persists for a long period of time, or is accompanied by additional symptoms, it is a good idea to be checked by an eye doctor to make sure nothing else is going on,” she said. If the twitching spreads to other muscles in the face or if you notice both eyes are twitching at the same time, those are indications of a more serious problem. Other red flags include a drooping eyelid or a red eye. But if just one eyelid is twitching on and off, it is usually a harmless (and often exasperating) case of eyelid myokymia. As for why it happens: “Nobody knows exactly why,” said Dr. Alice Lorch, an ophthalmologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in Boston. Sometimes it stems from a small irritation, for example a contact lens rubbing against the eyelid, she added. But more commonly, it is stress, lack of sleep or excessive caffeine intake that brings on eyelid twitching, the experts said. Dry eye, a common affliction among those who stare at screens most of the day, is another culprit. Studies have indicated that we blink less when looking at digital devices, which makes our eyes feel dry. There is no quick fix for an eyelid twitch once it starts, Dr. Lorch said. But artificial tears, eyedrops that lubricate the eye, can help. Ideally, choose ones that are preservative-free, because chemical preservatives can sometimes be irritating. You can also try massaging your eyes in the shower or covering your eyes with a damp, warm washcloth right before bed, she added, which will help relax your eye muscles and open the glands on the margins of the eyelids. This increases oil flow into the eyes and slows down tear evaporation. Other preventive measures include getting more rest and reducing stress. “Twitching is a signal by your body asking you to slow down,” said Dr. Raj Maturi, a spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Decreasing caffeine intake can also help prevent eye twitching, because large amounts of caffeine can lead to muscle tension. Having one or two cups of coffee each day should be fine, Dr. Lorch said. It’s also important to stay hydrated and eat a balanced diet that includes foods high in potassium (potatoes, bananas and lentils are great sources), magnesium (found in leafy green vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts and fish) and calcium (try dairy, sardines, dark leafy greens or fortified breakfast cereals), since imbalances in these minerals may lead to twitching. Tonic water is sometimes touted as a remedy for eyelid twitching because it contains a small amount of quinine. Quinine, a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat malaria, has also been used off-label to treat nighttime leg cramps, something the F.D.A. says is neither safe nor effective. There is no scientific evidence that tonic water prevents or alleviates eyelid twitching. Rarely, eye doctors will use Botox to stop the twitching by injecting a small amount into the orbicularis muscle that surrounds the eyelids, but this is done “only in severe cases,” Dr. Erwin said. Eyelid myokymia usually goes away on its own without medical intervention, the experts said. For most patients, it’s just a matter of resting, taking steps to reduce stress, lubricating the eye and waiting it out."

A bill gets caught up in the House; a world leader makes a blunder; a new variant of coronavirus grips the nation. In a normal week, any of those stories and more may battle for front-page treatment. The news never really stops — but there are days when it doesn’t break quite as dramatically. And for those days, The New York Times needs to plan accordingly: Even when there is little news that might seem worthy of the front page, The Times still needs to put out headlines. A reader might find the paper a bit thinner at the start of a week, during the middle of the summer and perhaps during what typically is the slowest news week of them all: the days between Christmas and New Year’s Day. As part of her duties as a senior editor, Alison Mitchell is instrumental in selecting the articles that will get prime positioning on The Times’s home page and the print front page. She says that the holiday week is always challenging, but planning early and trying not to panic too much (a little panicking keeps her on her toes) are two methods she has relied on since taking on her role in 2017. Editors meet every weekday morning at 9:00 to pitch their stories, but Ms. Mitchell has a sense of the top contenders well before then. “I’m swimming in the news day and night,” she said. After that, the print planning team gets to work. Well, they’ve already been at work: Josh Crutchmer, the print planning editor at The Times, leads a team of five that plots out a day’s, a week’s and sometimes, even a month’s worth of print coverage. He also communicates with The Times’s home page and digital teams. “I joke with people who don’t know what my job is that my job is to know everything,” he said. Mr. Crutchmer begins preparing for the holiday season in October, planning what will go where, and when, and adapting quickly when, inevitably, the plans change. In mid-December, Ms. Mitchell will hold a selection of stories that don’t have to run immediately and can be used in the last weeks of the year. Neither holds anything that is competitive in the news cycle; and they work closely with the desks producing the stories, like International and Business, in making decisions. Though there are exceptions — like last year, when much of late December was spent certifying the presidential election results — the week between Christmas and New Year’s, they said, is usually quiet and thus requires this rigorous prep work. There are, of course, events that don’t care if most of the country is off from work and sitting by the fire: the present Omicron coronavirus surge, for example, which is leading to new health guidance and planning for schools, airlines and businesses. Or, a natural disaster: In 2004, a tsunami crashed into communities along the coasts of the Indian Ocean on Dec. 26, and Times journalists on holiday mobilized to get the news on the Times’s front page the next day.  But the major institutions that The Times regularly covers — the White House, Congress, a major drug company — are usually shut down for the week. And even if those organizations are open, “nobody wants to make a big announcement in the middle of Christmas week,” Ms. Mitchell said. “So suddenly, all those engines of news stop.” To cover the slow cycle, The Times schedules pieces of enterprise journalism, longer reads that don’t necessarily have a strong time peg, to run during that week. Though enterprise stories — often deep dives into large-scope topics — run year-round, they might not get enough real estate in the print paper on a busy news week. The planning team always keeps a running list of enterprise stories on reserve. These articles are often some of The Times’s proudest work. “It’s almost always the case that the best stories get held for that last 10 days of December, because that’s when we think they’ll be most visible,” Mr. Crutchmer said. The meatier stories serve as great choices for the week, as readers are often off from work and have more time to peruse the paper. But enterprise stories are not always a safe bet. They can fall out of the lineup or hold for a variety of reasons — like if a reporter needs to do more fact-checking or add an additional source. That’s why Mr. Crutchmer always has several options on the bench. And though breaking news might give the paper more options, editors don’t necessarily yearn for it on Christmas Day. “I’ve worked many a Christmas, and I come in and I know, Oh God, let’s hope there’s no Christmas Day fire that burns down a block,” Ms. Mitchell said. “Sometimes, it seems if you do get news, it’s something really horrible.” Adriana Balsamo, a planning and design editor who focuses on the news section of the paper, doesn’t believe in slow news weeks (maybe slow hours, she says), but when a lighter week does roll around, she finds that the challenge is not so much filling the page, but limiting herself to just one or two of The Times’s many enterprise articles to feature. The tricky part is mapping out what goes where; on a busy week, that is dictated by the news. The first week of January, when institutions are only just starting back up and many enterprise stories have already run, hits like a wrecking ball. And then the churn begins again, swift and unstoppable."

In Midtown, Friday night was neon-bright and pleasantly mild, but a bit foggy and soggy, matching the ambivalent mood of a city and a country primed for a change but girding for another year of unexpected setbacks and dashed optimism. Yet there were signs of real cheer. Revelers, sprinkled two-deep behind N.Y.P.D. barricades, seemed stoked and giddy (although alcohol was banned inside the celebration zone); a new mayor, Eric Adams, was taking the oath of office just after midnight; and the final day of 2021 brimmed with encouraging reports that Omicron is, in fact, less lethal than prior waves of the coronavirus. Just before midnight, city officials opened up the barricades to admit hundreds of people who had been shut out of the celebration, adding a jolt of enthusiasm at the start of the new year. But for most of the night, the small, masked and semi-socially-distanced crowd made 2022 the most Groundhog Day of New Year’s Eves, more a throwback to last year’s sparse assemblage than the unbridled bacchanals of prepandemic times. In some places, police officers outnumbered civilians, and aerial shots above Times Square featured more pavement than people, the crowd a quarter of its typical size. Nor did it help that L.L. Cool J and Chlöe, two of the biggest headliners for ABC’s legacy broadcast, “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest,” had to pull out at the last minute after they tested positive. “We were ready and I was really looking forward to ringing in 2022 in my hometown in a special way, but for now I wish everyone a healthy and happy New Year,” L.L. Cool J, who was born in Bay Shore on Long Island, said in a statement. “The best is yet to come!” But Journey played “Don’t Stop Believing,” and the U.S.O. Show Troupe did their best to encourage the troops. Mr. Seacrest, who seemed relieved to be speaking at a normal level after years of shouting to be heard over much larger gatherings, struck his signature sunny tone. He predicted that “all of the hopes and possibilities” of the new year would come to pass. Behind him, a huge marquee flashed an ad for one of the program’s main sponsors, Carnival Cruise Line. On Thursday, a day earlier, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans to “avoid cruise travel regardless of vaccination status” until Omicron reached ebb tide. Similar warnings about the perils of travel during the wildfire stage of the variant did not, however, dissuade visitors who flocked to the ball dropping to experience an apex American tourist moment. Inside a spectator pen, Sebastián de la Torre and Michelle Robayo lay on the pavement early in the evening waiting for the festivities to begin, their heads resting on squishy purple-and-yellow top hats with the logo of a gym chain that everyone was offered as they entered. Their journey from Ecuador to New York was exhausting, and not entirely without sacrifice. Ms. Robayo’s pink backpack was confiscated at the entrance, a reminder of another, continued threat to New Year’s Eve: terrorism. But they managed to salvage the contents, including two little dolls with faces like smiling zombies, called años viejos, or “old years.” At midnight, Ecuadoreans and others in Latin America ritually burn them. “You close the year on all the bad things,” Mr. de la Torre said. “Covid — I got Covid, she did too.” Thousands of revelers shook balloons, danced to music, and shouted cheers during a Times Square New Year’s Eve celebration that came far closer to resembling the prepandemic festivities than last year’s muted affair. Thousands of locals and tourists swayed together under falling confetti to James Brown’s energetic “Living in America” and U2’s mournful anthem “One.” Some paused to reflect on what the night signified to them. Wendy Kahn, 61, a retired special-needs teacher from New Orleans, said she felt an urgent need at the end of a long year to make one of her wishes come true: Spending New Year’s Eve in Times Square. “I love that we can celebrate,” she said. “Seeing the celebrities, the confetti, the lights, it’s the most amazing thing.” Jennifer Gaitan, 33, a kindergarten teacher who lives on the Upper East Side, said that she came to the New Year’s Eve celebration with a hopeful heart after two years of recalibrating her wishes. “In 2020 and 2021 we all had these high expectations, now we have to let come what may,” she said. She added that it was her dream to spend New Year’s Eve in Times Square, because she has seen it so often in movies. “It was my moral imperative to be here,” she said. Michael Bautista traveled from Japan with his wife Hidemi and their 6-year-old daughter, Mayumi. Mr. Bautista said he wanted simply to celebrate after a difficult year. “Be happy, just be happy,” said Mr. Bautista, 31, a financial worker. “Last year we had nothing like this,” said Ms. Bautista, 29. “Despite the pandemic we should be happy.” The biggest safety threat looming over the New Year’s Eve celebration in Times Square in 2021 is the coronavirus, but the perimeter of the event is guarded against a threat that became apparent 20 years ago on Sept. 11: terrorism. All cross streets from 56th Street to 37th Street have been fenced off, with concrete blocks the size of love seats on the sidewalks and dump trucks parked diagonally across the pavement. Sixth Avenue is lined with wooden blockades stenciled with, “Police Line Do Not Cross.” New York Police Department officers have been joined by F.B.I. agents from the Joint Terrorism Task Force, State Police officers, and the department’s Strategic Response officers dressed in helmets and toting long guns. For private businesses for whom official law enforcement was insufficient, there was private security on display. A private security S.U.V. was parked outside a Bryant Park bank branch, and a security guard stood watch outside the Fox News headquarters, where a Christmas tree was set on fire earlier this month. Sharon Sanchez, who owns a security company in Miami, her hometown, said the public safety apparatus on display was a welcome sight on her first visit to New York City. “I think it’s great, it keeps us all safe,” said Ms. Sanchez, 58, who wore one of the purple and yellow top hats that had been handed out to revelers. But Grace Ponce, 25, a nanny from Houston, the show of force did nothing to alleviate her primary concern. “We worry about the virus,” she said. “We know we’re taking a risk.” In Times Square, the rules limiting attendance at the New Year’s Eve festivities to 15,000 — a fraction of the normal herd — seemed to be accomplishing their purpose Thursday evening. Each block had several barricaded areas containing dozens of people apiece, but most of the streets were passable only by police officers and members of the media. Inside a spectator pen, Sebastián de la Torre and Michelle Robayo lay on the pavement, their heads resting on the squishy purple-and-yellow top hats with the logo of a gym chain that everyone was offered as they entered. They were tired, they explained. The couple, visiting New York from Ecuador, had lined up before noon, and the moment the gates were opened, sprinted to a prime viewing spot. “We just left running,” said Mr. de la Torre, 34, an architect in Quito. “They think like we are cows here.” The journey was not without sacrifice. Ms. Robayo’s pink backpack was confiscated at the entrance. “This backpack has been all around the world — Spain, Italy, France, Dubai — and they made her throw it out,” Mr. de la Torre said. He brought up a video on his phone showing Ms. Robayo, 30, giving the backpack a sad goodbye hug. But they salvaged the contents, including two little dolls with faces like smiling zombies, called años viejos, or “old years.” At midnight, Ecuadoreans and others in Latin America ritually burn them. “You close the year on all the bad things,” Mr. de la Torre said. “Covid — I got Covid, she did too.” Not that they would dare actually set fire to something in Times Square. “Maybe they’ll think we’re doing something bad,” Mr. de la Torre said, “so we’ll burn it back home.” An hour later, though, an announcer blasting over the loudspeakers seemed to have channeled them. “2021 may have been a dumpster fire, but we’re making sure that New Year’s Eve 2022 is gonna be lit!” the announcer yelled. A gigantic screen showed a garbage can aflame as the announcer interviewed people about what they hoped to leave behind — chiefly the coronavirus. Behind the barricades north of 47th Street, where people were jammed shoulder to shoulder, Zoé Fauchi said she was scared even though she was excited. “We’re wearing our masks at all times, even while eating,” said Ms. Fauchi, 22, a law student from Normandy, France, waving a Kind bar. “I try to wear it while I’m chewing.” “I think as long as we keep our masks on we will be OK,” she added, though it sounded half like a question. Her friend Emma Marianni, 21 and also a law student, explained that she could not afford to get sick. “We’re supposed to take the plane home tomorrow and we have to get tested,” she said. “If I have Covid I won’t be able to go back to France.” Not that she would mind being stuck in New York. “I actually would like to stay here,” she said, “but I have exams next week.” People who contracted the Omicron variant of the coronavirus were about half as likely to need hospital care as those infected with the Delta variant, and one-third as likely to need emergency care, according to a report issued on Friday by British health officials. The analysis of public data also found that vaccination offers strong protection against hospitalization and severe illness following Omicron infection, helping prevent the worst outcomes even as infection rates in Britain soar to record levels. The findings represent some of the largest sets of real-world data to be released since the highly contagious variant was first discovered in late November, and add to a growing body of evidence that Omicron may not present as great a danger of hospitalization and severe illness to the public as earlier variants. “The latest set of analysis is in keeping with the encouraging signs we have already seen,” said Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at the health security agency. The risk of being admitted to a hospital for Omicron cases was 65 percent lower for those who had received two doses of a vaccine, compared with those who had not received any vaccination. The rate of hospitalization was even lower among those who had received three doses of vaccine, according to the report, which was issued by the U.K. Health Security Agency. People who had received booster doses were 81 percent less likely to be admitted to the hospital, compared with unvaccinated people, according to the agency. The agency analyzed 528,176 Omicron cases and 573,012 Delta cases between Nov. 22 and Dec. 26 to assess the risk of hospitalization in England. The researchers included all cases diagnosed in the community and then assessed the risk of general admission to the hospital or admission through emergency care. In a second study, the agency examined just symptomatic cases, linked with hospitalization data, and found that three doses of a vaccine reduced the risk of hospitalization for people with the Omicron variant by 88 percent, compared with unvaccinated people with that variant. While the world grappled with a bad case of stay-at-home claustrophobia in 2021, I was lucky — or foolish — to travel to four continents. I braved a total of 20 P.C.R. tests in Montreal, London, Lisbon, Toronto, Rio and Seoul, some during which it felt like my cerebellum was being stabbed with a long swab stuck up my nostril. A few other uncherished memories stand out. Among the 20 days I spent in quarantine this past year, one I would like to forget was my night at a quarantine hotel at Toronto’s airport in June. I was escorted to my room by a uniformed security guard as an older man in the elevator sneezed, a mask dangling alarmingly beneath his nose. I twisted and turned anxiously all night, but a subsequent Covid test came back negative. Then there was the nail-biting moment midway through a Lisbon vacation in June when British authorities suddenly removed Portugal from the country’s quarantine-free travel list. That meant I would need to quarantine for 10 days in London, if I didn’t get back before the dreaded status change, and then miss my return flight home, a few days later, to Montreal. I made it — with only a few hours to spare. While I traveled mostly for work and to satisfy my wanderlust, my trips underscored the stresses of traveling at a time when often confusing health orders can change with the speed of a deadly variant. The past year was a turbulent year for global travel, and, with Omicron surging from the United States to France, the immediate outlook for 2022 seems ominous. Many travelers are putting off trips until later in the year. Commercial airlines canceled 4,500 flights around the globe over Christmas weekend. Such was the dire state of travel in 2021 in many places that Bali, long a dream destination, received only a few dozen international visitors. In Britain, the number of visitors by air plunged by 97 percent in the first half of the year, according to the British tourism authority. Stuck at home during travel-imposed quarantines, I became a plant nerd; bought things I didn’t necessarily need, like a stainless steel dental plaque remover set; and gave myself catastrophic home haircuts that made me want to cower inside an extra few weeks. I’ve been fascinated by how different countries and cultures have adapted during a pandemic. When I arrived in London in May, just as a lockdown had lifted, there was a palpable party spirit, with people thronging inside pubs and frolicking in the streets. In South Korea, praised for its early handling of the pandemic, my fellow bikers along the Han River in Seoul studiously wore their masks outside. Come nighttime, however, some office workers compensated for 10 p.m. bar closures with marathon sessions of drinking soju, the popular Korean spirit often distilled from rice, before closing time. While on vacation in body-obsessed Rio, residents and fruit juice sellers crowded the sandy beaches of Ipanema in November, perhaps momentarily putting out of their minds the more than 20 million people reported to have tested positive for the coronavirus in Brazil. But at gyms, people bench-pressed while wearing masks. As for me, I am now back in Montreal, where gyms, bars, movie theaters and spas are closed. On New Year’s Eve, I have big plans to travel — from my bed to my living room. Even as some students were packing to head to campus, Michigan State, Vanderbilt, Miami and Duke have joined the growing list of universities changing their spring semester schedules as Omicron infections spread. In an announcement Friday, Michigan State joined nearly 50 other schools that had already announced either delayed starts or remote classes. The public university in East Lansing, Mich., where classes were scheduled to begin Jan. 10, will go remote for at least three weeks. Samuel L. Stanley, Michigan State’s president, noted what he called an “intense surge” in the virus in a message to the campus on Friday. Vanderbilt University in Nashville announced a delayed start to its spring semester. Classes will start Jan. 17 rather than Jan. 10. Nearby Tennessee State University also announced on Friday that it would not reopen on schedule, delaying classes until Jan. 24. Duke University, in Durham, N.C., extended the time its classes would be virtual, until Jan. 18, and urged students to delay their arrivals to campus even though residence halls were scheduled to open on Jan. 2. In a tweet, the university said that the rate of pandemic-related hospitalizations in North Carolina had doubled. And the University of Miami said its classes, scheduled to begin Jan. 18, would be remote for the first two weeks. The subdued atmosphere caused by the pandemic on what is usually a giddy holiday was evident at the Union Square Greenmarket in Manhattan on an unseasonably warm last day of 2021, as New Yorkers said goodbye to one difficult year and steeled themselves for another. Many of those in the modest crowd perusing stands stocked with plants, vegetables, baked goods and other items did not appear overly concerned about the virus: At least half were not wearing masks, but were holding them in their hands or tucking them under their chins instead. Still, their comments told a more nuanced story. Bruce Perry, 72, of Coney Island, browsed the market’s offerings while heading to Paragon Sports on the square’s north side. The Omicron variant’s prevalence had dampened his New Year’s Eve mood. “I’m a little depressed,” he said. “I’m tired of wearing this mask every day.” He added that he had just started to feel comfortable being outside without it. “But I know we got to wear it with everything going on,” he said. “We’ve got to learn to live with it.” Mr. Perry, who is vaccinated and has gotten a booster shot, said he had been careful to avoid large crowds and had recently canceled a trip to Atlanta to visit his two daughters and three grandchildren. “I’ll just have to wait,” he said. “I don’t want to get sick, and I don’t want them to get sick.” “Hopefully 2022 will be better,” he added. “It doesn’t look like it’s getting any better.” George Martin was also on the square’s north side, playing Nat King Cole’s “Nature Boy” and “Maria” from West Side Story on his trumpet as a few passers-by dropped dollar bills in his small gray duffle bag while wishing him a Happy New Year. A 71-year-old retiree who lives on Manhattan’s Upper East Side and busks in the parks several days a week, Mr. Martin said he was sure 2022 would bring its share of problems, but that was no reason to stop living. “There’s a lot of confusion right now about Omicron, but what are you going to do?” he said. “Lock yourself in your room? Life is too short.” Soph Ehrlich, 27, a social worker, said they were weary of the pandemic and frustrated by how it had affected the poor families they work with. Still, Mx. Ehrlich, who grew up on East 15th Street and now lives in Oakland, Calif., said the sense of community that had developed over the past 12 months was encouraging. “I’m tired, but I don’t feel hopeless.” Mx. Erlich said. “I have trust in people to take care of one another.” In Brooklyn, the mood was also muted outside Woodhull Hospital Center, a city-run facility straddling the Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhoods where the line to get a P.C.R. test ran along a fenced-in driveway. Sulphina Bennett was among those who were waiting. Ms. Bennett, 39, said she had gotten sick with Covid-19 in January and had gotten vaccinated after that. So when a rapid test came back positive after she spent Christmas with her parents, she decided to get another opinion. “I’m doing this just to make sure,” Ms. Bennett, wearing an overcoat and floral-print mask, said from her place near the front of the line. She said she had been waiting for 90 minutes. Ms. Bennett said she felt like she had a mild cold. But she was not taking her symptoms lightly. A colleague died of Covid earlier in the pandemic, she said. Another had it now. “It’s like all of us are getting it one by one,” she said. The wait for tests was about 30 minutes at a city-run health clinic in a parking lot next to the Brooklyn Queens Expressway in Fort Greene. Those who were waiting included Stacey Campbell, Adam Szlachetka and their 2-year-old daughter, Noa, who started prekindergarten in September. “This is the first time she’s had to specifically test for school,” Ms. Campbell, 39, said. “I don’t know if it’s going to be regular but we did get an email saying, ‘Every child, get a test before coming back on the 4th.’” She said that tests for herself and Mr. Szlachetka, 42, were precautionary. “We’ve been lucky,” Ms. Campbell said. Both are vaccinated and neither has gotten the virus. But word that Ms. Campbell’s mother had been exposed to someone who was infected threw a scare into the family’s Christmas, setting off a frantic round of testing and online reading. “We were waiting til the last minute to see if my mom could come for Christmas,” Ms. Campbell said. “We all made it. Her and her husband had to eat in the hallway.” “Other than that,” she added with laugh, “we were all together.” As for New Year’s plans, Ms. Campbell said, “We’re going to make a champagne cocktail and get tested and feel good about that. And hope for a better 2022.” By 4 p.m., those intent on welcoming the new year at or near this year’s scaled-back version of the traditional Times Square New Year’s Eve celebration had begun to gather. Several hundred people stood on the south side of police barricades at 38th Street and Seventh Avenue, waiting to enter the section where the festivities would be held or lingering to get a distant look as the night unfolded. More than a year after Covid waylaid their grand plans, the owners of Gage & Tollner, a century-old Brooklyn chophouse that closed in 2004, reopened the doors on Fulton Street in April 2021 after a restoration of the historic site. As this difficult year came to a close, their eatery — which had been the site of an Arby’s and a TGI Fridays in the years since the previous owners closed Gage & Tollner — was recognized on several lists of New York’s best new restaurants. “We’re pretty completely proud,” said Sohui Kim, the chef partner who revitalized the spot with her husband, Ben Schneider, and St. John Frizell. “Obviously, we had to go through hoops and hurdles and really deal with all that the world dealt with in terms of Covid.” And as with the world, the year did not end without more hurdles to leap. The arrival of Omicron turned a planned brief Christmas break into a 10-day closure, until Gage reopened on Wednesday in time for New Year’s Eve. The city’s rules on mask-wearing, which had been relaxed when the pandemic eased, have been imposed yet again, and the staff is required to wear them at all times. About 30 percent of those who signed up for five-course prix fixe pampering tonight canceled. But Ms. Kim said that they hope to have more than 100 guests to toast in the New Year. Ms. Kim is back at work after herself enduring a bout of Covid over Christmas. Despite the pandemic, she and Mr. Schneider have kept afloat another business they own, Insa, a Korean barbecue and karaoke restaurant in Gowanus. But in 2022 they will have to figure out what to do with the spot where they closed the Good Fork in Red Hook at the start of the pandemic. In the meantime, they have used it as a pop-up space for aspiring young chefs such as Leland Yu. Their partner, Mr. Frizell, recently announced he would close Fort Defiance, another Red Hook spot which he had transformed during the pandemic from a restaurant into a gourmet grocery store, with hopes of reopening in the spring. “My hope for 2022 is that we could somehow see this Covid experience in the rearview mirror, and if that happens in 2022, that would be beyond awesome,” Ms. Kim said. “But we’re still in it, trying to pivot and figure out what to do.” With the news that South Africa has now passed the peak of its coronavirus cases caused by the Omicron variant, scientists are projecting that the United States’ sharp increase in cases will crest as soon as the middle of January. Over the past month the Omicron variant has spread around the world with astonishing speed, even among people who are vaccinated or who had recovered from previous infections. On Thursday the United States surpassed 580,000 cases, beating the record set only a day before. That is believed to be a vast undercount, because of testing shortages, the popularity of at-home tests and reporting delays over the holidays. What’s more, a significant number of people may have asymptomatic infections and never know it. New estimates from researchers at Columbia University suggest that the United States could peak by Jan. 9 at around 2.5 million cases per week, though that number may go as high as 5.4 million. In New York City, the first U.S. metropolis to see a major surge, the researchers estimated that cases would peak by the first week of the new year. “It’s shocking. It’s disturbing,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist who led the Columbia modeling work. “We’re seeing unprecedented numbers of Covid-19 cases.” The variant is significantly milder than Delta and other versions of the virus, and is far less likely to lead to hospitalizations, according to data from South Africa and preliminary data from Britain released on Friday. Still, the enormous numbers of people getting simultaneously infected could greatly strain hospitals, experts said, especially in places with lower vaccination rates or in places where hospitals are already overburdened. Just how much of a burden the variant will be, however, depends on how quickly it will burn out in particular communities, especially in large cities. Those complex transmission dynamics have been maddeningly difficult to predict with precision. Another model, released by a research group from the University of Washington last week, estimated that the United States would reach a peak in cases by the end of January. But even those researchers are now rethinking their projections based on Omicron’s rapid spread. “We are realizing right now monitoring the data that the peak is going to come much faster,” said Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington. “My guess is it will happen before mid-January.” The numbers are increasing so quickly that some epidemiologists say modeling isn’t even necessary to see where things are headed, said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “The context for all of this is that hospitals are struggling,” Dr. Hanage said. “We don’t have that much spare capacity. And of course, Omicron makes that worse.” There are some reasons to think that the variant’s behavior in the United States might be different than in other countries. In South Africa, for example, the population is much younger, and a large proportion had been infected by earlier waves of the virus. In Britain, the vaccination rate for older people is much higher than in the United States. While South Africa saw a rapid increase in cases followed by a sharp decline, it’s unclear whether cases will crest in the United States in a similar fashion. Because of the number of unknowns, including the emergence of new variants and government restrictions aimed at curbing transmission, Shaman’s group limits its projections to four to six weeks in the future. Two things can cause new infections to decline, according to Natalie Dean, an epidemiologist at Emory University. The biggest contributor is that the virus can burn through people in certain communities, especially dense cities; when it stops finding people to infect, new cases decline. People may also change their behaviors, whether through societal restrictions or on their own, giving the virus fewer opportunities to find them. “Our communities are complicated — it doesn’t mean that everyone in the community has gotten infected,” Dr. Dean said. “It’s kind of the people who are most connected.” The United States could also see more localized outbreaks, with cases beginning to decline in current hot spots, like New York City and Washington D.C., just as they’re beginning to take off elsewhere. That could lead to more of a rounded peak instead of a sharp turnaround, Dr. Shaman said. Nearly 600,000 public university students in New York will soon be required to get vaccination booster shots as part of the state’s stepped-up effort to combat a record-breaking coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on Friday. In addition, State University of New York and City University of New York faculty members will now be subject to a vaccination requirement, and a statewide mask mandate that is already in effect will be extended until at least the end of January, Ms. Hochul said at a morning news briefing. The governor unveiled the measures, part of a broader plan labeled “Winter Surge 2.0,” as the fast-spreading Omicron variant continued to push the number of virus cases in the state to new heights with each passing day. On Thursday, the state reported 74,000 new cases of the virus; about 44,000 were in New York City. On Friday, Ms. Hochul announced 76,000 new cases, with the New York City region having the most per capita. The positivity rate for tests was 16 percent statewide, she said. “We are breaking records every day, and we will continue to do so until we hit that downward trend,” the governor said. Hospitalizations linked to the virus have also risen sharply, to almost 8,000 across the state. About half were in New York City. Twenty-one hospitals in the state have suspended elective surgeries as a result of the rise in virus patients. Ms. Hochul called the increase in hospitalizations “very concerning” while speaking at the briefing. “They are putting a lot of stress on an already overtaxed health care system,” she said. To help address the problem, the governor said the state would be releasing more ventilation machines from its stockpile and dispatching additional members of the National Guard to hospitals that are especially overtaxed. The booster requirement for SUNY and CUNY students, which takes effect Jan. 15, reflects Ms. Hochul’s desire to keep the state’s public education system operating with in-person classes at all levels despite the Omicron-driven outbreak. Dozens of colleges and universities in the United States have already taken such a step. New York’s public university students will also be required to show a negative Covid-19 test result when they return to campus, and masks will be mandatory indoors, Ms. Hochul said. As part of her drive to keep schools open and avoid what she has called last year’s “failed experiment” in remote learning, the governor said that more than five million rapid test kits would be provided to school districts serving students from kindergarten to 12th grade. The goal in distributing the kits is to allow for “test-to-stay” policies under which a student takes two rapid tests if a classmate tests positive. If the tests come back negative, the student can remain in school, she said. As for the mask mandate, New York State has had one in place since Dec. 13 for all indoor public places, including offices, building lobbies and stores. Businesses can opt out if they require full vaccination for everyone 12 and older. Children 5 to 11 must have at least one vaccine dose. Ms. Hochul originally said the mask mandate would end on Jan. 15, but on Friday she extended it through the end of January because of the soaring virus case numbers. New York’s fight to contain the virus is also drawing reinforcements from the federal government, which is deploying disaster response units to the state, sending 50 ambulance teams to New York City and dispatching emergency medical teams to SUNY Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse and the Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo, officials said."

Mr. Rocha, an amateur photographer, had recently arrived in Canada from Madeira with $50 in savings and a beat-up old Canon camera that he always carried with him in his car. Wearing his gray and blue polyester janitor’s uniform, a long key ring dangling from his pocket, he recalls, he summoned up the courage and asked the forlorn grandmother if he could shoot the baby’s bris — for free."

In Midtown, Friday night was neon-bright and pleasantly mild, but a bit foggy and soggy, matching the ambivalent mood of a city and a country primed for a change but girding for another year of unexpected setbacks and dashed optimism. Yet there were signs of real cheer. Revelers, sprinkled two-deep behind N.Y.P.D. barricades, seemed stoked and giddy (although alcohol was banned inside the celebration zone); a new mayor, Eric Adams, was taking the oath of office just after midnight; and the final day of 2021 brimmed with encouraging reports that Omicron is, in fact, less lethal than prior waves of the coronavirus. Just before midnight, city officials opened up the barricades to admit hundreds of people who had been shut out of the celebration, adding a jolt of enthusiasm at the start of the new year. But for most of the night, the small, masked and semi-socially-distanced crowd made 2022 the most Groundhog Day of New Year’s Eves, more a throwback to last year’s sparse assemblage than the unbridled bacchanals of prepandemic times. In some places, police officers outnumbered civilians, and aerial shots above Times Square featured more pavement than people, the crowd a quarter of its typical size. Nor did it help that L.L. Cool J and Chlöe, two of the biggest headliners for ABC’s legacy broadcast, “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest,” had to pull out at the last minute after they tested positive. “We were ready and I was really looking forward to ringing in 2022 in my hometown in a special way, but for now I wish everyone a healthy and happy New Year,” L.L. Cool J, who was born in Bay Shore on Long Island, said in a statement. “The best is yet to come!” But Journey played “Don’t Stop Believing,” and the U.S.O. Show Troupe did their best to encourage the troops. Mr. Seacrest, who seemed relieved to be speaking at a normal level after years of shouting to be heard over much larger gatherings, struck his signature sunny tone. He predicted that “all of the hopes and possibilities” of the new year would come to pass. Behind him, a huge marquee flashed an ad for one of the program’s main sponsors, Carnival Cruise Line. On Thursday, a day earlier, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans to “avoid cruise travel regardless of vaccination status” until Omicron reached ebb tide. Similar warnings about the perils of travel during the wildfire stage of the variant did not, however, dissuade visitors who flocked to the ball dropping to experience an apex American tourist moment. Inside a spectator pen, Sebastián de la Torre and Michelle Robayo lay on the pavement early in the evening waiting for the festivities to begin, their heads resting on squishy purple-and-yellow top hats with the logo of a gym chain that everyone was offered as they entered. Their journey from Ecuador to New York was exhausting, and not entirely without sacrifice. Ms. Robayo’s pink backpack was confiscated at the entrance, a reminder of another, continued threat to New Year’s Eve: terrorism. But they managed to salvage the contents, including two little dolls with faces like smiling zombies, called años viejos, or “old years.” At midnight, Ecuadoreans and others in Latin America ritually burn them. “You close the year on all the bad things,” Mr. de la Torre said. “Covid — I got Covid, she did too.” Thousands of revelers shook balloons, danced to music, and shouted cheers during a Times Square New Year’s Eve celebration that came far closer to resembling the prepandemic festivities than last year’s muted affair. Thousands of locals and tourists swayed together under falling confetti to James Brown’s energetic “Living in America” and U2’s mournful anthem “One.” Some paused to reflect on what the night signified to them. Wendy Kahn, 61, a retired special-needs teacher from New Orleans, said she felt an urgent need at the end of a long year to make one of her wishes come true: Spending New Year’s Eve in Times Square. “I love that we can celebrate,” she said. “Seeing the celebrities, the confetti, the lights, it’s the most amazing thing.” Jennifer Gaitan, 33, a kindergarten teacher who lives on the Upper East Side, said that she came to the New Year’s Eve celebration with a hopeful heart after two years of recalibrating her wishes. “In 2020 and 2021 we all had these high expectations, now we have to let come what may,” she said. She added that it was her dream to spend New Year’s Eve in Times Square, because she has seen it so often in movies. “It was my moral imperative to be here,” she said. Michael Bautista traveled from Japan with his wife Hidemi and their 6-year-old daughter, Mayumi. Mr. Bautista said he wanted simply to celebrate after a difficult year. “Be happy, just be happy,” said Mr. Bautista, 31, a financial worker. “Last year we had nothing like this,” said Ms. Bautista, 29. “Despite the pandemic we should be happy.” The biggest safety threat looming over the New Year’s Eve celebration in Times Square in 2021 is the coronavirus, but the perimeter of the event is guarded against a threat that became apparent 20 years ago on Sept. 11: terrorism. All cross streets from 56th Street to 37th Street have been fenced off, with concrete blocks the size of love seats on the sidewalks and dump trucks parked diagonally across the pavement. Sixth Avenue is lined with wooden blockades stenciled with, “Police Line Do Not Cross.” New York Police Department officers have been joined by F.B.I. agents from the Joint Terrorism Task Force, State Police officers, and the department’s Strategic Response officers dressed in helmets and toting long guns. For private businesses for whom official law enforcement was insufficient, there was private security on display. A private security S.U.V. was parked outside a Bryant Park bank branch, and a security guard stood watch outside the Fox News headquarters, where a Christmas tree was set on fire earlier this month. Sharon Sanchez, who owns a security company in Miami, her hometown, said the public safety apparatus on display was a welcome sight on her first visit to New York City. “I think it’s great, it keeps us all safe,” said Ms. Sanchez, 58, who wore one of the purple and yellow top hats that had been handed out to revelers. But Grace Ponce, 25, a nanny from Houston, the show of force did nothing to alleviate her primary concern. “We worry about the virus,” she said. “We know we’re taking a risk.” In Times Square, the rules limiting attendance at the New Year’s Eve festivities to 15,000 — a fraction of the normal herd — seemed to be accomplishing their purpose Thursday evening. Each block had several barricaded areas containing dozens of people apiece, but most of the streets were passable only by police officers and members of the media. Inside a spectator pen, Sebastián de la Torre and Michelle Robayo lay on the pavement, their heads resting on the squishy purple-and-yellow top hats with the logo of a gym chain that everyone was offered as they entered. They were tired, they explained. The couple, visiting New York from Ecuador, had lined up before noon, and the moment the gates were opened, sprinted to a prime viewing spot. “We just left running,” said Mr. de la Torre, 34, an architect in Quito. “They think like we are cows here.” The journey was not without sacrifice. Ms. Robayo’s pink backpack was confiscated at the entrance. “This backpack has been all around the world — Spain, Italy, France, Dubai — and they made her throw it out,” Mr. de la Torre said. He brought up a video on his phone showing Ms. Robayo, 30, giving the backpack a sad goodbye hug. But they salvaged the contents, including two little dolls with faces like smiling zombies, called años viejos, or “old years.” At midnight, Ecuadoreans and others in Latin America ritually burn them. “You close the year on all the bad things,” Mr. de la Torre said. “Covid — I got Covid, she did too.” Not that they would dare actually set fire to something in Times Square. “Maybe they’ll think we’re doing something bad,” Mr. de la Torre said, “so we’ll burn it back home.” An hour later, though, an announcer blasting over the loudspeakers seemed to have channeled them. “2021 may have been a dumpster fire, but we’re making sure that New Year’s Eve 2022 is gonna be lit!” the announcer yelled. A gigantic screen showed a garbage can aflame as the announcer interviewed people about what they hoped to leave behind — chiefly the coronavirus. Behind the barricades north of 47th Street, where people were jammed shoulder to shoulder, Zoé Fauchi said she was scared even though she was excited. “We’re wearing our masks at all times, even while eating,” said Ms. Fauchi, 22, a law student from Normandy, France, waving a Kind bar. “I try to wear it while I’m chewing.” “I think as long as we keep our masks on we will be OK,” she added, though it sounded half like a question. Her friend Emma Marianni, 21 and also a law student, explained that she could not afford to get sick. “We’re supposed to take the plane home tomorrow and we have to get tested,” she said. “If I have Covid I won’t be able to go back to France.” Not that she would mind being stuck in New York. “I actually would like to stay here,” she said, “but I have exams next week.” People who contracted the Omicron variant of the coronavirus were about half as likely to need hospital care as those infected with the Delta variant, and one-third as likely to need emergency care, according to a report issued on Friday by British health officials. The analysis of public data also found that vaccination offers strong protection against hospitalization and severe illness following Omicron infection, helping prevent the worst outcomes even as infection rates in Britain soar to record levels. The findings represent some of the largest sets of real-world data to be released since the highly contagious variant was first discovered in late November, and add to a growing body of evidence that Omicron may not present as great a danger of hospitalization and severe illness to the public as earlier variants. “The latest set of analysis is in keeping with the encouraging signs we have already seen,” said Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at the health security agency. The risk of being admitted to a hospital for Omicron cases was 65 percent lower for those who had received two doses of a vaccine, compared with those who had not received any vaccination. The rate of hospitalization was even lower among those who had received three doses of vaccine, according to the report, which was issued by the U.K. Health Security Agency. People who had received booster doses were 81 percent less likely to be admitted to the hospital, compared with unvaccinated people, according to the agency. The agency analyzed 528,176 Omicron cases and 573,012 Delta cases between Nov. 22 and Dec. 26 to assess the risk of hospitalization in England. The researchers included all cases diagnosed in the community and then assessed the risk of general admission to the hospital or admission through emergency care. In a second study, the agency examined just symptomatic cases, linked with hospitalization data, and found that three doses of a vaccine reduced the risk of hospitalization for people with the Omicron variant by 88 percent, compared with unvaccinated people with that variant. While the world grappled with a bad case of stay-at-home claustrophobia in 2021, I was lucky — or foolish — to travel to four continents. I braved a total of 20 P.C.R. tests in Montreal, London, Lisbon, Toronto, Rio and Seoul, some during which it felt like my cerebellum was being stabbed with a long swab stuck up my nostril. A few other uncherished memories stand out. Among the 20 days I spent in quarantine this past year, one I would like to forget was my night at a quarantine hotel at Toronto’s airport in June. I was escorted to my room by a uniformed security guard as an older man in the elevator sneezed, a mask dangling alarmingly beneath his nose. I twisted and turned anxiously all night, but a subsequent Covid test came back negative. Then there was the nail-biting moment midway through a Lisbon vacation in June when British authorities suddenly removed Portugal from the country’s quarantine-free travel list. That meant I would need to quarantine for 10 days in London, if I didn’t get back before the dreaded status change, and then miss my return flight home, a few days later, to Montreal. I made it — with only a few hours to spare. While I traveled mostly for work and to satisfy my wanderlust, my trips underscored the stresses of traveling at a time when often confusing health orders can change with the speed of a deadly variant. The past year was a turbulent year for global travel, and, with Omicron surging from the United States to France, the immediate outlook for 2022 seems ominous. Many travelers are putting off trips until later in the year. Commercial airlines canceled 4,500 flights around the globe over Christmas weekend. Such was the dire state of travel in 2021 in many places that Bali, long a dream destination, received only a few dozen international visitors. In Britain, the number of visitors by air plunged by 97 percent in the first half of the year, according to the British tourism authority. Stuck at home during travel-imposed quarantines, I became a plant nerd; bought things I didn’t necessarily need, like a stainless steel dental plaque remover set; and gave myself catastrophic home haircuts that made me want to cower inside an extra few weeks. I’ve been fascinated by how different countries and cultures have adapted during a pandemic. When I arrived in London in May, just as a lockdown had lifted, there was a palpable party spirit, with people thronging inside pubs and frolicking in the streets. In South Korea, praised for its early handling of the pandemic, my fellow bikers along the Han River in Seoul studiously wore their masks outside. Come nighttime, however, some office workers compensated for 10 p.m. bar closures with marathon sessions of drinking soju, the popular Korean spirit often distilled from rice, before closing time. While on vacation in body-obsessed Rio, residents and fruit juice sellers crowded the sandy beaches of Ipanema in November, perhaps momentarily putting out of their minds the more than 20 million people reported to have tested positive for the coronavirus in Brazil. But at gyms, people bench-pressed while wearing masks. As for me, I am now back in Montreal, where gyms, bars, movie theaters and spas are closed. On New Year’s Eve, I have big plans to travel — from my bed to my living room. Even as some students were packing to head to campus, Michigan State, Vanderbilt, Miami and Duke have joined the growing list of universities changing their spring semester schedules as Omicron infections spread. In an announcement Friday, Michigan State joined nearly 50 other schools that had already announced either delayed starts or remote classes. The public university in East Lansing, Mich., where classes were scheduled to begin Jan. 10, will go remote for at least three weeks. Samuel L. Stanley, Michigan State’s president, noted what he called an “intense surge” in the virus in a message to the campus on Friday. Vanderbilt University in Nashville announced a delayed start to its spring semester. Classes will start Jan. 17 rather than Jan. 10. Nearby Tennessee State University also announced on Friday that it would not reopen on schedule, delaying classes until Jan. 24. Duke University, in Durham, N.C., extended the time its classes would be virtual, until Jan. 18, and urged students to delay their arrivals to campus even though residence halls were scheduled to open on Jan. 2. In a tweet, the university said that the rate of pandemic-related hospitalizations in North Carolina had doubled. And the University of Miami said its classes, scheduled to begin Jan. 18, would be remote for the first two weeks. The subdued atmosphere caused by the pandemic on what is usually a giddy holiday was evident at the Union Square Greenmarket in Manhattan on an unseasonably warm last day of 2021, as New Yorkers said goodbye to one difficult year and steeled themselves for another. Many of those in the modest crowd perusing stands stocked with plants, vegetables, baked goods and other items did not appear overly concerned about the virus: At least half were not wearing masks, but were holding them in their hands or tucking them under their chins instead. Still, their comments told a more nuanced story. Bruce Perry, 72, of Coney Island, browsed the market’s offerings while heading to Paragon Sports on the square’s north side. The Omicron variant’s prevalence had dampened his New Year’s Eve mood. “I’m a little depressed,” he said. “I’m tired of wearing this mask every day.” He added that he had just started to feel comfortable being outside without it. “But I know we got to wear it with everything going on,” he said. “We’ve got to learn to live with it.” Mr. Perry, who is vaccinated and has gotten a booster shot, said he had been careful to avoid large crowds and had recently canceled a trip to Atlanta to visit his two daughters and three grandchildren. “I’ll just have to wait,” he said. “I don’t want to get sick, and I don’t want them to get sick.” “Hopefully 2022 will be better,” he added. “It doesn’t look like it’s getting any better.” George Martin was also on the square’s north side, playing Nat King Cole’s “Nature Boy” and “Maria” from West Side Story on his trumpet as a few passers-by dropped dollar bills in his small gray duffle bag while wishing him a Happy New Year. A 71-year-old retiree who lives on Manhattan’s Upper East Side and busks in the parks several days a week, Mr. Martin said he was sure 2022 would bring its share of problems, but that was no reason to stop living. “There’s a lot of confusion right now about Omicron, but what are you going to do?” he said. “Lock yourself in your room? Life is too short.” Soph Ehrlich, 27, a social worker, said they were weary of the pandemic and frustrated by how it had affected the poor families they work with. Still, Mx. Ehrlich, who grew up on East 15th Street and now lives in Oakland, Calif., said the sense of community that had developed over the past 12 months was encouraging. “I’m tired, but I don’t feel hopeless.” Mx. Erlich said. “I have trust in people to take care of one another.” In Brooklyn, the mood was also muted outside Woodhull Hospital Center, a city-run facility straddling the Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhoods where the line to get a P.C.R. test ran along a fenced-in driveway. Sulphina Bennett was among those who were waiting. Ms. Bennett, 39, said she had gotten sick with Covid-19 in January and had gotten vaccinated after that. So when a rapid test came back positive after she spent Christmas with her parents, she decided to get another opinion. “I’m doing this just to make sure,” Ms. Bennett, wearing an overcoat and floral-print mask, said from her place near the front of the line. She said she had been waiting for 90 minutes. Ms. Bennett said she felt like she had a mild cold. But she was not taking her symptoms lightly. A colleague died of Covid earlier in the pandemic, she said. Another had it now. “It’s like all of us are getting it one by one,” she said. The wait for tests was about 30 minutes at a city-run health clinic in a parking lot next to the Brooklyn Queens Expressway in Fort Greene. Those who were waiting included Stacey Campbell, Adam Szlachetka and their 2-year-old daughter, Noa, who started prekindergarten in September. “This is the first time she’s had to specifically test for school,” Ms. Campbell, 39, said. “I don’t know if it’s going to be regular but we did get an email saying, ‘Every child, get a test before coming back on the 4th.’” She said that tests for herself and Mr. Szlachetka, 42, were precautionary. “We’ve been lucky,” Ms. Campbell said. Both are vaccinated and neither has gotten the virus. But word that Ms. Campbell’s mother had been exposed to someone who was infected threw a scare into the family’s Christmas, setting off a frantic round of testing and online reading. “We were waiting til the last minute to see if my mom could come for Christmas,” Ms. Campbell said. “We all made it. Her and her husband had to eat in the hallway.” “Other than that,” she added with laugh, “we were all together.” As for New Year’s plans, Ms. Campbell said, “We’re going to make a champagne cocktail and get tested and feel good about that. And hope for a better 2022.” By 4 p.m., those intent on welcoming the new year at or near this year’s scaled-back version of the traditional Times Square New Year’s Eve celebration had begun to gather. Several hundred people stood on the south side of police barricades at 38th Street and Seventh Avenue, waiting to enter the section where the festivities would be held or lingering to get a distant look as the night unfolded. More than a year after Covid waylaid their grand plans, the owners of Gage & Tollner, a century-old Brooklyn chophouse that closed in 2004, reopened the doors on Fulton Street in April 2021 after a restoration of the historic site. As this difficult year came to a close, their eatery — which had been the site of an Arby’s and a TGI Fridays in the years since the previous owners closed Gage & Tollner — was recognized on several lists of New York’s best new restaurants. “We’re pretty completely proud,” said Sohui Kim, the chef partner who revitalized the spot with her husband, Ben Schneider, and St. John Frizell. “Obviously, we had to go through hoops and hurdles and really deal with all that the world dealt with in terms of Covid.” And as with the world, the year did not end without more hurdles to leap. The arrival of Omicron turned a planned brief Christmas break into a 10-day closure, until Gage reopened on Wednesday in time for New Year’s Eve. The city’s rules on mask-wearing, which had been relaxed when the pandemic eased, have been imposed yet again, and the staff is required to wear them at all times. About 30 percent of those who signed up for five-course prix fixe pampering tonight canceled. But Ms. Kim said that they hope to have more than 100 guests to toast in the New Year. Ms. Kim is back at work after herself enduring a bout of Covid over Christmas. Despite the pandemic, she and Mr. Schneider have kept afloat another business they own, Insa, a Korean barbecue and karaoke restaurant in Gowanus. But in 2022 they will have to figure out what to do with the spot where they closed the Good Fork in Red Hook at the start of the pandemic. In the meantime, they have used it as a pop-up space for aspiring young chefs such as Leland Yu. Their partner, Mr. Frizell, recently announced he would close Fort Defiance, another Red Hook spot which he had transformed during the pandemic from a restaurant into a gourmet grocery store, with hopes of reopening in the spring. “My hope for 2022 is that we could somehow see this Covid experience in the rearview mirror, and if that happens in 2022, that would be beyond awesome,” Ms. Kim said. “But we’re still in it, trying to pivot and figure out what to do.” With the news that South Africa has now passed the peak of its coronavirus cases caused by the Omicron variant, scientists are projecting that the United States’ sharp increase in cases will crest as soon as the middle of January. Over the past month the Omicron variant has spread around the world with astonishing speed, even among people who are vaccinated or who had recovered from previous infections. On Thursday the United States surpassed 580,000 cases, beating the record set only a day before. That is believed to be a vast undercount, because of testing shortages, the popularity of at-home tests and reporting delays over the holidays. What’s more, a significant number of people may have asymptomatic infections and never know it. New estimates from researchers at Columbia University suggest that the United States could peak by Jan. 9 at around 2.5 million cases per week, though that number may go as high as 5.4 million. In New York City, the first U.S. metropolis to see a major surge, the researchers estimated that cases would peak by the first week of the new year. “It’s shocking. It’s disturbing,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist who led the Columbia modeling work. “We’re seeing unprecedented numbers of Covid-19 cases.” The variant is significantly milder than Delta and other versions of the virus, and is far less likely to lead to hospitalizations, according to data from South Africa and preliminary data from Britain released on Friday. Still, the enormous numbers of people getting simultaneously infected could greatly strain hospitals, experts said, especially in places with lower vaccination rates or in places where hospitals are already overburdened. Just how much of a burden the variant will be, however, depends on how quickly it will burn out in particular communities, especially in large cities. Those complex transmission dynamics have been maddeningly difficult to predict with precision. Another model, released by a research group from the University of Washington last week, estimated that the United States would reach a peak in cases by the end of January. But even those researchers are now rethinking their projections based on Omicron’s rapid spread. “We are realizing right now monitoring the data that the peak is going to come much faster,” said Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington. “My guess is it will happen before mid-January.” The numbers are increasing so quickly that some epidemiologists say modeling isn’t even necessary to see where things are headed, said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “The context for all of this is that hospitals are struggling,” Dr. Hanage said. “We don’t have that much spare capacity. And of course, Omicron makes that worse.” There are some reasons to think that the variant’s behavior in the United States might be different than in other countries. In South Africa, for example, the population is much younger, and a large proportion had been infected by earlier waves of the virus. In Britain, the vaccination rate for older people is much higher than in the United States. While South Africa saw a rapid increase in cases followed by a sharp decline, it’s unclear whether cases will crest in the United States in a similar fashion. Because of the number of unknowns, including the emergence of new variants and government restrictions aimed at curbing transmission, Shaman’s group limits its projections to four to six weeks in the future. Two things can cause new infections to decline, according to Natalie Dean, an epidemiologist at Emory University. The biggest contributor is that the virus can burn through people in certain communities, especially dense cities; when it stops finding people to infect, new cases decline. People may also change their behaviors, whether through societal restrictions or on their own, giving the virus fewer opportunities to find them. “Our communities are complicated — it doesn’t mean that everyone in the community has gotten infected,” Dr. Dean said. “It’s kind of the people who are most connected.” The United States could also see more localized outbreaks, with cases beginning to decline in current hot spots, like New York City and Washington D.C., just as they’re beginning to take off elsewhere. That could lead to more of a rounded peak instead of a sharp turnaround, Dr. Shaman said. Nearly 600,000 public university students in New York will soon be required to get vaccination booster shots as part of the state’s stepped-up effort to combat a record-breaking coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on Friday. In addition, State University of New York and City University of New York faculty members will now be subject to a vaccination requirement, and a statewide mask mandate that is already in effect will be extended until at least the end of January, Ms. Hochul said at a morning news briefing. The governor unveiled the measures, part of a broader plan labeled “Winter Surge 2.0,” as the fast-spreading Omicron variant continued to push the number of virus cases in the state to new heights with each passing day. On Thursday, the state reported 74,000 new cases of the virus; about 44,000 were in New York City. On Friday, Ms. Hochul announced 76,000 new cases, with the New York City region having the most per capita. The positivity rate for tests was 16 percent statewide, she said. “We are breaking records every day, and we will continue to do so until we hit that downward trend,” the governor said. Hospitalizations linked to the virus have also risen sharply, to almost 8,000 across the state. About half were in New York City. Twenty-one hospitals in the state have suspended elective surgeries as a result of the rise in virus patients. Ms. Hochul called the increase in hospitalizations “very concerning” while speaking at the briefing. “They are putting a lot of stress on an already overtaxed health care system,” she said. To help address the problem, the governor said the state would be releasing more ventilation machines from its stockpile and dispatching additional members of the National Guard to hospitals that are especially overtaxed. The booster requirement for SUNY and CUNY students, which takes effect Jan. 15, reflects Ms. Hochul’s desire to keep the state’s public education system operating with in-person classes at all levels despite the Omicron-driven outbreak. Dozens of colleges and universities in the United States have already taken such a step. New York’s public university students will also be required to show a negative Covid-19 test result when they return to campus, and masks will be mandatory indoors, Ms. Hochul said. As part of her drive to keep schools open and avoid what she has called last year’s “failed experiment” in remote learning, the governor said that more than five million rapid test kits would be provided to school districts serving students from kindergarten to 12th grade. The goal in distributing the kits is to allow for “test-to-stay” policies under which a student takes two rapid tests if a classmate tests positive. If the tests come back negative, the student can remain in school, she said. As for the mask mandate, New York State has had one in place since Dec. 13 for all indoor public places, including offices, building lobbies and stores. Businesses can opt out if they require full vaccination for everyone 12 and older. Children 5 to 11 must have at least one vaccine dose. Ms. Hochul originally said the mask mandate would end on Jan. 15, but on Friday she extended it through the end of January because of the soaring virus case numbers. New York’s fight to contain the virus is also drawing reinforcements from the federal government, which is deploying disaster response units to the state, sending 50 ambulance teams to New York City and dispatching emergency medical teams to SUNY Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse and the Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo, officials said. The American biotechnology company Novavax said on Friday that it would ask the Food and Drug Administration to authorize its Covid-19 vaccine in January. If approved, the vaccine would be the fourth to become available in the United States, which already has ample supplies. Novavax said that it had sent the F.D.A. the final data needed to complete its application for emergency use authorization. Novavax, based in Maryland, won $1.6 billion in support from the United States government in 2020 to develop a vaccine made of proteins from the coronavirus, but it has lagged behind vaccine developers Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, and has struggled with its clinical trials and manufacturing. Still, the company’s vaccine, known as Nuvaxovid, has recently received a cascade of positive news. Earlier in December, the company’s researchers published a report in The New England Journal of Medicine, presenting evidence that Nuvaxovid was 90 percent effective against symptomatic infections and 100 percent effective in averting moderate to severe disease. The World Health Organization granted Nuvaxovid an emergency-use listing, and the European Commission authorized it as well. Nuvaxovid has side effects that are usually mild or moderate and that clear up within a couple days. Protein-based vaccines have been used for decades and generally have a strong safety record. It is not yet clear, though, how well Nuvaxovid will work against the more contagious Omicron variant. In studies of other vaccines, researchers have found that Omicron is consistently better at evading vaccines. Novavax is developing an Omicron-specific version of its product and will soon test it, the company said."

The fire, as intense as it was sudden, sent tens of thousands of residents of Boulder County scrambling to leave department stores and houses on Thursday as fire trucks swarmed the area. Though wildfires are seen as less of a threat in suburban areas, especially in December, a period of intense drought had created the conditions for the flames to spread, destroying houses, a shopping complex and a hotel. “It felt like the apocalypse,” said Ruthie Werner, a resident of Louisville, Colo., who had gone to shop at a Target store but arrived to find the parking lot ablaze. Gov. Jared Polis said at a news briefing that President Biden had approved an expedited major disaster declaration, which allows those who lost their homes or small business to get assistance before the preliminary damage assessment is done. He said schools and major hospitals in the area were spared.  As Mr. Polis toured the damage by helicopter on Friday, video published by a local television station showed how the flames had struck seemingly at random. One house on a cul-de-sac would be destroyed, while the others looked to be intact. In one neighborhood, a line of about 10 still-smoldering rubble piles was next to other houses that had appeared to escape severe damage. Despite the destruction, no deaths had been recorded, a figure that Mr. Polis said at the news conference would be a “New Year’s miracle” if it held. “It wasn’t a wildfire in the forest, it was a suburban and urban fire,” said Mr. Polis, a Democrat who lives in Boulder County. “The Costco we all shop at, the Target we buy our kids’ clothes at — all damaged.” The fire, which began late Thursday morning, burned in a “mosaic” fashion, encouraged by 105 mile-an-hour winds. It torched about 6,000 acres, said Sheriff Joe Pelle of Boulder County, who added that damage assessments were still being done on Friday. The authorities suspect the fire was caused by a downed power line, but that has not been confirmed, he said.  Much of the fire has been contained, with only a few parts of Boulder County still smoldering, he said. Heavy snowfall was in the forecast for Friday, which would help tamp down the fire but could also lead to freezing pipes, officials said. Louisville and Superior, both about nine miles east of Boulder, suffered the most “catastrophic” losses, he said. Residents of those cities were ordered to evacuate on Thursday, along with residents of nearby Broomfield and Westminster. While there was no immediate official count of how many people were ultimately displaced, an estimated 200 people are currently staying at emergency shelters in the county, Mr. Polis said. Evacuees fled the fire zones under plumes of smoke that clouded the sky for miles on Thursday, not knowing if their houses would make it through the night. Roads and highways in the Denver metro area were jammed with thousands of residents trying to flee. “It took us almost an hour to get out of our neighborhood — it was complete gridlock,” said John Stein, who was walking his dog in Superior when he saw smoke in the area and heard sirens. Thomas Maxwell, 25, said he did not know on Thursday if his parents’ house in Louisville was still standing. Mr. Maxwell, who lives in California, had been dog-sitting for them while they vacationed in Spain. He woke them with a midnight call to say that he had evacuated to a hotel with their two dogs. “It was crazy how fast it happened,” Maxwell said. “I read about wildfires in California all the time. Now I’m experiencing it. It’s so different.” Wildfires in the American West have been worsening — growing larger, spreading faster and reaching into mountainous elevations that were once too wet and cool to have supported fierce fires. What was once a seasonal phenomenon has become a year-round menace, with fires burning later into the fall and into the winter. Recent research has suggested that heat and dryness associated with global warming are major reasons for the increase in bigger and stronger fires, as rainfall patterns have been disrupted, snow melts earlier and meadows and forests are scorched into kindling. Colorado had the three largest wildfires in its history in the summer of 2020, each one burning more than 200,000 acres, Mr. Polis said. But those fires burned federally owned forests and land, he said, while the fires on Thursday destroyed suburban developments and shopping plazas. “As a millennial, I’m just looking outside and I’m seeing climate change,” said Angelica Kalika, 36, of Broomfield. “I’m seeing my future. I grew up in Colorado, and this is a place where I’ve had snowy Christmases and a nice 60-degree summer. But, for me, this is a moment of deep reckoning of climate change when there is a wildfire outside my door.” Ruthie Werner, 45, an artist and designer who lives in Louisville, Colo., had been quarantining with her family after her husband contracted Covid-19. But on Thursday, after she and her son and daughter tested negative, they decided to drive to Target to do some Christmas returns and shake off their cabin fever. When they got there, the parking lot was in flames. Smoke was staining the air, and every small patch of grass or vegetation Ms. Werner could see was ablaze. “It felt like the apocalypse,” Ms. Werner said. They drove back home and quickly decided to pack up even before the mandatory evacuations came down. Her children grabbed a few Christmas gifts, and her daughter grabbed a painting of their old family dog. And they bolted for a hotel as far from the smoke and flames as they could. “We just wanted to get out of the smoke,” Ms. Werner said. “We couldn’t breathe. Our eyes were watering. My daughter kept saying her eyes were hurting.” They and neighbors were checking in on their homes remotely through doorbell cameras, and Ms. Werner said her family’s house still appeared to be standing on Thursday evening. But other neighbors had watched through security cameras as flames swallowed up their houses. “If the wind could just stop,” she said from the airport hotel room where she and her family is spending the night. But the images of billowing smoke on the television suggested it still was not slowing down. For shoppers in nearby Superior, a Costco run also turned into an evacuation as flames came dangerously close to the store around noon on Thursday. Robert Gutierrez, 20, had seen smoke billowing on his way to the Costco, but the fire had not reached the store yet, he said. However, five minutes into his shopping trip, the shoppers were asked to evacuate. He could barely see through the smoke as he drove away, he said, when a truck driver coming in the opposite direction gestured at him to turn around. As he did, a trail of flames tore through the road just in front of his car and reached his windshield. “Thankfully, I exited out,” he said. While the threat of wildfires looms as a constant threat over Western mountain towns and homes tucked into the woods, people who fled the smoke and flying embers on Thursday were astonished at how the fast-moving blazes had raged through their suburban neighborhoods. “When does this happen in such a suburban area?” asked Alli Bowdey, a nurse who left her home in the Boulder suburb of Louisville and packed into a friend’s house with other evacuated family members. “We grew up with friends losing their homes in the mountains. What happens here? Nothing.” But wildfires in the American West have been worsening — growing larger, spreading faster and reaching into mountainous elevations that were once too wet and cool to have supported fierce fires. What was once a seasonal phenomenon has become a year-round menace, with fires burning later into the fall and into the winter. Recent research has suggested that heat and dryness associated with global warming are major reasons for the increase in bigger and stronger fires, as rainfall patterns have been disrupted, snow melts earlier and meadows and forests are scorched into kindling.

I grew up in Colorado, and this is a place where I’ve had snowy Christmases and a nice 60-degree summer. But, for me, this is a moment of deep reckoning of climate change when there is a wildfire outside my door.” Across the Boulder area, displaced neighbors pored over the news for updates on whether their homes had survived and compared notes on businesses where they had seen fires scorching parking lots and approaching buildings. A city recreation center. A Chuck E. Cheese. A grocery store. Normally, businesses like these, surrounded by asphalt and concrete, are protected from wildfires. But weeks of warm, dry weather that stretched from the autumn through December turned communities across the plains of Colorado into a wintertime tinderbox, and the frenzied winds on Thursday created a firestorm that left few places safe. “It’s popping up all over the place,” Ms. Bowdey said. “These embers are flying all over the place. It’s a shock to everybody. Nobody wakes up planning for this.” At about 5:30 p.m., she said she got an update from a neighbor. The fire was now two blocks away from their home. The fast-moving wildfires in Colorado on Thursday that forced tens of thousands of people to flee and destroyed hundreds of homes were a sobering reminder that wildfires have become a year-round phenomenon in the American West. It is never too early to plan for a potential evacuation, even if you are not in an area immediately affected by smoke or flames. Wildfires can spread very quickly, move erratically and travel great distances — especially when driven by the wind, as Thursday’s fires were, experts say. Here are some suggestions to prepare for such an emergency. Make a plan. Families should set a meeting point in case they get separated and map at least two evacuation routes. Prepare an emergency supply kit. Think beyond a flashlight, batteries, and food and water. Cal Fire, the firefighting agency in California, a state that records thousands of wildfires a year, recommends gathering a three-day supply of nonperishable food and three gallons of water per person. Also pack a change of clothes, prescription medications and extra eyeglasses or contact lenses. If you have pets, do not forget about pet food and medication. Keep important documents together. Gather birth certificates, property titles, insurance records and other crucial paperwork. In addition to being difficult to replace, some of the documents could be needed to file claims after the fire. Prepare your home. If you have time, move flammable items like wood piles, brush and propane tanks at least 30 feet away from your house. Shut all windows and doors, but leave them unlocked once you evacuate, so firefighters can get in. Turn on outdoor lights so firefighters can see the house through the smoke. Shut off the gas at the meter, and turn off the air-conditioning. Fuel up. Keep the family car topped off with gas to avoid any delays. Go to the ATM. Cash is key after emergencies. Keep your credit cards handy, too. Tune in to local media. There is no better source for information on evacuation orders, routes and shelters, said Brandi Richard, public affairs officer for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “Monitoring their websites is really important, because as things come in, they’re sharing them on social media.” You do not need to wait for an order. This is especially true in densely populated areas where there may be traffic jams. Pack a “go bag.” Make sure you have the essentials, especially if you can’t get to your emergency supply kit. Denver’s Office of Emergency Management suggests you pack the following: medicine, important documents, clothes, cash, a blanket, face masks, hand sanitizer water and snacks. Grab your electronics. Cellphones, personal computers, backup hard drives and chargers should all go into the car, along with the emergency kit, personal documents, family keepsakes, cash and credit cards. Don’t forget the pets. They will be scared. Be smart in the car. Close your windows and use recirculated air-conditioning. Tune in to local radio to hear about safe routes. The recovery efforts are just beginning for those in the path of the devastating wildfires that tore through parts of Boulder County, Colo., on Thursday. Local and national volunteers and aid groups are prepared to rescue and feed and give shelter to those who have been affected by the fires, which have burned at least 500 homes and several businesses. Here are some ways you can help relief efforts. Before you make a donation, especially to a lesser-known organization, you should do some research to make sure it is reputable. Sites like Charity Navigator and Guidestar grade nonprofits based on transparency and effectiveness. The Internal Revenue Service also allows you to search its database to find out whether an organization is eligible to receive tax-deductible contributions. And if you suspect an organization or individual of committing fraud, you can report it to the National Center for Disaster Fraud, part of the Justice Department. Boulder County set up a fund to offer monetary aid to the victims of the fires. Donations can be sent through PayPal. Boulder County is also accepting donations of food, water and services. People can offer items through this form that the county set up. JEWISHcolorado, a local organization, is raising money to “assist organizations serving those in need.” It said 100 percent of the donations would go toward relief efforts. Airbnb connects hosts with people who need a place to stay during a crisis. The Boulder County authorities suggested that interested people sign up to host those who have been displaced. The Red Cross has opened an evacuation center and is accepting donations to help with its recovery efforts in Colorado."

So what should you do if you’re one of them? We spoke to physicians and infectious disease experts about the steps you should take after a positive test or if you find out you’ve been in close contact with an infected person. Here’s their advice. If you’re in public or around people when you get the bad news, put on a mask immediately. Then isolate yourself as quickly as possible, even if you don’t have symptoms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends isolating for at least five full days, followed by five days of wearing a mask around others, as long as you don’t have a fever and any other symptoms are improving. If you are seriously ill with Covid or have a weakened immune system, the C.D.C. recommends an isolation period of 10 to 20 days. If you have a fever, the agency advises you to stay home until the fever resolves. Read more about the new C.D.C. guidelines. If you are waiting for test results but have symptoms of Covid-19, the C.D.C. now recommends that you isolate anyway, regardless of vaccination status. If you live with roommates or family, try to separate yourself from other people (and animals) as much as possible. “You should take yourself out of society,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco. “Wall yourself up in a cocoon.” Isolating in a home with other people may be difficult, but do the best you can. That means staying in your room, away from other members of the household, even for meals. Someone should deliver food to your bedroom door if possible. If the home has more than one bathroom, designate one just for the infected person. If the infected person is a child or older person who needs assistance, both the caregiver and the infected person should wear a mask when the caregiver enters the room, and open the windows if possible. If others are in the house, always wear a high-quality mask when you leave your room. Everyone should mask up in shared spaces. After using a shared bathroom, disinfect the toilet seat and handle, as well as the faucet handles, soap dispenser, counter and light switch. Close the lid before you flush, and turn on the exhaust fan. Open windows to improve ventilation in shared areas. The people living in your household should take precautions, but they don’t need to panic about getting infected too, especially if they’re vaccinated and boosted. “The household rate of contracting Covid from someone is not 100 percent by a long shot, even with the more transmissible variants,” said Dr. Paul Sax, an infectious disease expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School. While it can help incrementally to continue to wipe down shared spaces, “the most important thing is keeping people from breathing air that is filled with germs,” said Tara Kirk Sell, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. If you have a HEPA air cleaner, place it in or outside your bedroom. If you’ve tested positive and feel well, you can take a walk outdoors and get fresh air. If you’re in a city where you will cross paths with other people, wear a mask and keep your distance. If you tested positive after taking a rapid home test, you may want to take a second home test using a different brand or go to a testing center to confirm the result. False positives aren’t common with home tests, but they can happen. Even so, you should assume the positive result is correct, wear a mask and avoid close contact with other people until you get retested. If your positive test came from a laboratory, a second test isn’t necessary. If you receive a negative test on your rapid home test, don’t use that as your sole basis for decision making. The C.D.C. advises that a negative result on a rapid home test does not rule out a Covid infection. To improve the results from an antigen test, the agency recommends testing twice over a three-day period with at least 24 hours and no more than 48 hours between tests. No. In most cases, you won’t know which variant of coronavirus you’ve caught and your lab test typically won’t tell you. In general, the guidance on isolation, monitoring and treatment does not change based on which variant infected you. Think about where you’ve been and who might have inhaled your germs. Contact your employer and let them know. Most workplaces have protocols in place for contact tracing when an employee tests positive. You also want to alert anyone with whom you’ve spent time, going back at least two days before you got tested or started having symptoms, said Dr. Sax. The C.D.C. defines a close contact as someone who was less than six feet from you for 15 minutes or more. It may feel overwhelming, or even shameful, to tell people about your positive test, said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. “A lot of people think it’s some failure if you get infected,” Dr. Jha said. “This is an incredibly contagious variant. A lot of people are going to get it. That is not a moral failure.” Don’t forget to tell your doctor too, particularly if you have an underlying medical condition, like high blood pressure or diabetes, that puts you at higher risk. If the infected person is a child, call your pediatrician. You also need to call your child’s school, as well as anyone they’ve had close contact with at play dates, parties or other activities. Monitor your symptoms. You can use a pulse oximeter to keep track of your blood oxygen levels. Most healthy people will get an oxygen reading around 95 to 99 percent. You should seek medical advice if the reading drops quickly or the level dips to 93 percent or lower. The devices can be less accurate for people with darker skin, so pay attention to the trend. If your reading drops by four points, it’s worth checking in with a doctor. You should also see a doctor if you take a turn for the worse, have trouble breathing or have any symptom that causes you concern. You can learn more in our story, Why Days 5 to 10 Are So Important When You Have Coronavirus. Ask your doctor if you are eligible for monoclonal antibodies, a treatment that can help your body fight Covid-19 and lower your risk for severe illness, particularly for people in a high-risk group. For monoclonal antibody therapy to be most effective, it needs to be given soon after diagnosis, even if you’re not feeling bad yet. If you don’t have a regular doctor, you can also contact the infectious disease clinic at your hospital and ask about the treatment, said Dr. Celine Gounder, an epidemiologist at N.Y.U. medical school. Only one monoclonal antibody treatment, sotrovimab made by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology, has performed well against Omicron in laboratory experiments. Although the supply of sotrovimab is very limited, the Biden administration is in talks with GlaxoSmithKline about securing more doses to be delivered by early next year. The Food and Drug Administration has authorized two different oral treatments for people who are vulnerable to becoming severely ill because they are older or have medical conditions such as obesity or diabetes. Paxlovid, developed by Pfizer, is authorized for high-risk patients age 12 and older, and is meant to be taken as 30 pills over five days. Another pill treatment from Merck, known as molnupiravir, has been authorized for people 18 and older, and is meant to be taken as 40 pills over five days. To calculate your five-day isolation period, count your first day of symptoms as Day 0. If you never had symptoms but have a confirmed positive test, count Day 0 as the day you tested. You can leave isolation after five days if you don’t have a fever and any symptoms you had are getting better. If your symptoms persist or get worse, if you are immunocompromised or are severely ill with Covid, consult with your health care provider about when to leave isolation, which may last between 10 and 20 days. After isolation, the C.D.C. advises that you keep wearing a mask around others for an additional five days. Don’t remove your mask to eat or drink around other people, don’t travel and don’t spend time around high risk people until the masking period has ended. Although the agency didn’t recommend testing after isolation, the new guidelines say people should take a rapid antigen test after the five day isolation period if they have “access to a test and want to test.” Vaccinated adults who had booster shots and fully vaccinated children don’t need to quarantine after a potential exposure, but they should get tested five days later and wear masks around other people for 10 days.  People who are unvaccinated should quarantine for five days after exposure and then get tested. Wear masks around other people for 10 days. This also applies to people who are eligible for booster shots but have not received them yet. The C.D.C. has said that unvaccinated students who are exposed to the virus do not need to miss school after a potential exposure as long as two tests taken during the next week are negative. Read more about the “test to stay” protocol. Yes. The degree of protection you get from a previous infection varies widely. You’re more protected if you’ve also been vaccinated. Early studies suggest antibodies from a past Covid infection alone are not a strong defense against Omicron. “Unfortunately, reinfection after people have had Covid before, can occur, and the protection of previous infections is very variable and unpredictable,” said Dr. David Rubin, the director of PolicyLab at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. “So some people seem to be very protected and don’t get Covid again, and other people can get it again and even get quite severe disease again.”"

In a country with high levels of misgivings about Covid-19 vaccines and citizens quick to challenge authority, the deal was an unexpected success. It turned France into one of Europe’s most vaccinated countries, quashed street protests by government critics, and boosted President Emmanuel Macron’s re-election bid as a semblance of normal life returned. Even die-hard skeptics became believers — for a while, at least. “I told myself, great, everybody’s going to get vaccinated and, in three months, we’ll all be OK, we’ll get our freedom back,” said Marc Olissone, 60, who was visiting Paris from northern France and had initially resisted getting a shot. “I got vaccinated because that’s the only way I could go to the movies or visit friends in Paris.”"

In Midtown, Friday night was neon-bright and pleasantly mild, but a bit foggy and soggy, matching the ambivalent mood of a city and a country primed for a change but girding for another year of unexpected setbacks and dashed optimism. Yet there were signs of real cheer. Revelers, sprinkled two-deep behind N.Y.P.D. barricades, seemed stoked and giddy (although alcohol was banned inside the celebration zone); a new mayor, Eric Adams, was taking the oath of office just after midnight; and the final day of 2021 brimmed with encouraging reports that Omicron is, in fact, less lethal than prior waves of the coronavirus. Just before midnight, city officials opened up the barricades to admit hundreds of people who had been shut out of the celebration, adding a jolt of enthusiasm at the start of the new year. But for most of the night, the small, masked and semi-socially-distanced crowd made 2022 the most Groundhog Day of New Year’s Eves, more a throwback to last year’s sparse assemblage than the unbridled bacchanals of prepandemic times. In some places, police officers outnumbered civilians, and aerial shots above Times Square featured more pavement than people, the crowd a quarter of its typical size. Nor did it help that L.L. Cool J and Chlöe, two of the biggest headliners for ABC’s legacy broadcast, “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest,” had to pull out at the last minute after they tested positive. “We were ready and I was really looking forward to ringing in 2022 in my hometown in a special way, but for now I wish everyone a healthy and happy New Year,” L.L. Cool J, who was born in Bay Shore on Long Island, said in a statement. “The best is yet to come!” But Journey played “Don’t Stop Believing,” and the U.S.O. Show Troupe did their best to encourage the troops. Mr. Seacrest, who seemed relieved to be speaking at a normal level after years of shouting to be heard over much larger gatherings, struck his signature sunny tone. He predicted that “all of the hopes and possibilities” of the new year would come to pass. Behind him, a huge marquee flashed an ad for one of the program’s main sponsors, Carnival Cruise Line. On Thursday, a day earlier, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans to “avoid cruise travel regardless of vaccination status” until Omicron reached ebb tide. Similar warnings about the perils of travel during the wildfire stage of the variant did not, however, dissuade visitors who flocked to the ball dropping to experience an apex American tourist moment. Inside a spectator pen, Sebastián de la Torre and Michelle Robayo lay on the pavement early in the evening waiting for the festivities to begin, their heads resting on squishy purple-and-yellow top hats with the logo of a gym chain that everyone was offered as they entered. Their journey from Ecuador to New York was exhausting, and not entirely without sacrifice. Ms. Robayo’s pink backpack was confiscated at the entrance, a reminder of another, continued threat to New Year’s Eve: terrorism. But they managed to salvage the contents, including two little dolls with faces like smiling zombies, called años viejos, or “old years.” At midnight, Ecuadoreans and others in Latin America ritually burn them. “You close the year on all the bad things,” Mr. de la Torre said. “Covid — I got Covid, she did too.” Thousands of revelers shook balloons, danced to music, and shouted cheers during a Times Square New Year’s Eve celebration that came far closer to resembling the prepandemic festivities than last year’s muted affair. Thousands of locals and tourists swayed together under falling confetti to James Brown’s energetic “Living in America” and U2’s mournful anthem “One.” Some paused to reflect on what the night signified to them. Wendy Kahn, 61, a retired special-needs teacher from New Orleans, said she felt an urgent need at the end of a long year to make one of her wishes come true: Spending New Year’s Eve in Times Square. “I love that we can celebrate,” she said. “Seeing the celebrities, the confetti, the lights, it’s the most amazing thing.” Jennifer Gaitan, 33, a kindergarten teacher who lives on the Upper East Side, said that she came to the New Year’s Eve celebration with a hopeful heart after two years of recalibrating her wishes. “In 2020 and 2021 we all had these high expectations, now we have to let come what may,” she said. She added that it was her dream to spend New Year’s Eve in Times Square, because she has seen it so often in movies. “It was my moral imperative to be here,” she said. Michael Bautista traveled from Japan with his wife Hidemi and their 6-year-old daughter, Mayumi. Mr. Bautista said he wanted simply to celebrate after a difficult year. “Be happy, just be happy,” said Mr. Bautista, 31, a financial worker. “Last year we had nothing like this,” said Ms. Bautista, 29. “Despite the pandemic we should be happy.” The biggest safety threat looming over the New Year’s Eve celebration in Times Square in 2021 is the coronavirus, but the perimeter of the event is guarded against a threat that became apparent 20 years ago on Sept. 11: terrorism. All cross streets from 56th Street to 37th Street have been fenced off, with concrete blocks the size of love seats on the sidewalks and dump trucks parked diagonally across the pavement. Sixth Avenue is lined with wooden blockades stenciled with, “Police Line Do Not Cross.” New York Police Department officers have been joined by F.B.I. agents from the Joint Terrorism Task Force, State Police officers, and the department’s Strategic Response officers dressed in helmets and toting long guns. For private businesses for whom official law enforcement was insufficient, there was private security on display. A private security S.U.V. was parked outside a Bryant Park bank branch, and a security guard stood watch outside the Fox News headquarters, where a Christmas tree was set on fire earlier this month. Sharon Sanchez, who owns a security company in Miami, her hometown, said the public safety apparatus on display was a welcome sight on her first visit to New York City. “I think it’s great, it keeps us all safe,” said Ms. Sanchez, 58, who wore one of the purple and yellow top hats that had been handed out to revelers. But Grace Ponce, 25, a nanny from Houston, the show of force did nothing to alleviate her primary concern. “We worry about the virus,” she said. “We know we’re taking a risk.” In Times Square, the rules limiting attendance at the New Year’s Eve festivities to 15,000 — a fraction of the normal herd — seemed to be accomplishing their purpose Thursday evening. Each block had several barricaded areas containing dozens of people apiece, but most of the streets were passable only by police officers and members of the media. Inside a spectator pen, Sebastián de la Torre and Michelle Robayo lay on the pavement, their heads resting on the squishy purple-and-yellow top hats with the logo of a gym chain that everyone was offered as they entered. They were tired, they explained. The couple, visiting New York from Ecuador, had lined up before noon, and the moment the gates were opened, sprinted to a prime viewing spot. “We just left running,” said Mr. de la Torre, 34, an architect in Quito. “They think like we are cows here.” The journey was not without sacrifice. Ms. Robayo’s pink backpack was confiscated at the entrance. “This backpack has been all around the world — Spain, Italy, France, Dubai — and they made her throw it out,” Mr. de la Torre said. He brought up a video on his phone showing Ms. Robayo, 30, giving the backpack a sad goodbye hug. But they salvaged the contents, including two little dolls with faces like smiling zombies, called años viejos, or “old years.” At midnight, Ecuadoreans and others in Latin America ritually burn them. “You close the year on all the bad things,” Mr. de la Torre said. “Covid — I got Covid, she did too.” Not that they would dare actually set fire to something in Times Square. “Maybe they’ll think we’re doing something bad,” Mr. de la Torre said, “so we’ll burn it back home.” An hour later, though, an announcer blasting over the loudspeakers seemed to have channeled them. “2021 may have been a dumpster fire, but we’re making sure that New Year’s Eve 2022 is gonna be lit!” the announcer yelled. A gigantic screen showed a garbage can aflame as the announcer interviewed people about what they hoped to leave behind — chiefly the coronavirus. Behind the barricades north of 47th Street, where people were jammed shoulder to shoulder, Zoé Fauchi said she was scared even though she was excited. “We’re wearing our masks at all times, even while eating,” said Ms. Fauchi, 22, a law student from Normandy, France, waving a Kind bar. “I try to wear it while I’m chewing.” “I think as long as we keep our masks on we will be OK,” she added, though it sounded half like a question. Her friend Emma Marianni, 21 and also a law student, explained that she could not afford to get sick. “We’re supposed to take the plane home tomorrow and we have to get tested,” she said. “If I have Covid I won’t be able to go back to France.” Not that she would mind being stuck in New York. “I actually would like to stay here,” she said, “but I have exams next week.” People who contracted the Omicron variant of the coronavirus were about half as likely to need hospital care as those infected with the Delta variant, and one-third as likely to need emergency care, according to a report issued on Friday by British health officials. The analysis of public data also found that vaccination offers strong protection against hospitalization and severe illness following Omicron infection, helping prevent the worst outcomes even as infection rates in Britain soar to record levels. The findings represent some of the largest sets of real-world data to be released since the highly contagious variant was first discovered in late November, and add to a growing body of evidence that Omicron may not present as great a danger of hospitalization and severe illness to the public as earlier variants. “The latest set of analysis is in keeping with the encouraging signs we have already seen,” said Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at the health security agency. The risk of being admitted to a hospital for Omicron cases was 65 percent lower for those who had received two doses of a vaccine, compared with those who had not received any vaccination. The rate of hospitalization was even lower among those who had received three doses of vaccine, according to the report, which was issued by the U.K. Health Security Agency. People who had received booster doses were 81 percent less likely to be admitted to the hospital, compared with unvaccinated people, according to the agency. The agency analyzed 528,176 Omicron cases and 573,012 Delta cases between Nov. 22 and Dec. 26 to assess the risk of hospitalization in England. The researchers included all cases diagnosed in the community and then assessed the risk of general admission to the hospital or admission through emergency care. In a second study, the agency examined just symptomatic cases, linked with hospitalization data, and found that three doses of a vaccine reduced the risk of hospitalization for people with the Omicron variant by 88 percent, compared with unvaccinated people with that variant. While the world grappled with a bad case of stay-at-home claustrophobia in 2021, I was lucky — or foolish — to travel to four continents. I braved a total of 20 P.C.R. tests in Montreal, London, Lisbon, Toronto, Rio and Seoul, some during which it felt like my cerebellum was being stabbed with a long swab stuck up my nostril. A few other uncherished memories stand out. Among the 20 days I spent in quarantine this past year, one I would like to forget was my night at a quarantine hotel at Toronto’s airport in June. I was escorted to my room by a uniformed security guard as an older man in the elevator sneezed, a mask dangling alarmingly beneath his nose. I twisted and turned anxiously all night, but a subsequent Covid test came back negative. Then there was the nail-biting moment midway through a Lisbon vacation in June when British authorities suddenly removed Portugal from the country’s quarantine-free travel list. That meant I would need to quarantine for 10 days in London, if I didn’t get back before the dreaded status change, and then miss my return flight home, a few days later, to Montreal. I made it — with only a few hours to spare. While I traveled mostly for work and to satisfy my wanderlust, my trips underscored the stresses of traveling at a time when often confusing health orders can change with the speed of a deadly variant. The past year was a turbulent year for global travel, and, with Omicron surging from the United States to France, the immediate outlook for 2022 seems ominous. Many travelers are putting off trips until later in the year. Commercial airlines canceled 4,500 flights around the globe over Christmas weekend. Such was the dire state of travel in 2021 in many places that Bali, long a dream destination, received only a few dozen international visitors. In Britain, the number of visitors by air plunged by 97 percent in the first half of the year, according to the British tourism authority. Stuck at home during travel-imposed quarantines, I became a plant nerd; bought things I didn’t necessarily need, like a stainless steel dental plaque remover set; and gave myself catastrophic home haircuts that made me want to cower inside an extra few weeks. I’ve been fascinated by how different countries and cultures have adapted during a pandemic. When I arrived in London in May, just as a lockdown had lifted, there was a palpable party spirit, with people thronging inside pubs and frolicking in the streets. In South Korea, praised for its early handling of the pandemic, my fellow bikers along the Han River in Seoul studiously wore their masks outside. Come nighttime, however, some office workers compensated for 10 p.m. bar closures with marathon sessions of drinking soju, the popular Korean spirit often distilled from rice, before closing time. While on vacation in body-obsessed Rio, residents and fruit juice sellers crowded the sandy beaches of Ipanema in November, perhaps momentarily putting out of their minds the more than 20 million people reported to have tested positive for the coronavirus in Brazil. But at gyms, people bench-pressed while wearing masks. As for me, I am now back in Montreal, where gyms, bars, movie theaters and spas are closed. On New Year’s Eve, I have big plans to travel — from my bed to my living room. Even as some students were packing to head to campus, Michigan State, Vanderbilt, Miami and Duke have joined the growing list of universities changing their spring semester schedules as Omicron infections spread. In an announcement Friday, Michigan State joined nearly 50 other schools that had already announced either delayed starts or remote classes. The public university in East Lansing, Mich., where classes were scheduled to begin Jan. 10, will go remote for at least three weeks. Samuel L. Stanley, Michigan State’s president, noted what he called an “intense surge” in the virus in a message to the campus on Friday. Vanderbilt University in Nashville announced a delayed start to its spring semester. Classes will start Jan. 17 rather than Jan. 10. Nearby Tennessee State University also announced on Friday that it would not reopen on schedule, delaying classes until Jan. 24. Duke University, in Durham, N.C., extended the time its classes would be virtual, until Jan. 18, and urged students to delay their arrivals to campus even though residence halls were scheduled to open on Jan. 2. In a tweet, the university said that the rate of pandemic-related hospitalizations in North Carolina had doubled. And the University of Miami said its classes, scheduled to begin Jan. 18, would be remote for the first two weeks. The subdued atmosphere caused by the pandemic on what is usually a giddy holiday was evident at the Union Square Greenmarket in Manhattan on an unseasonably warm last day of 2021, as New Yorkers said goodbye to one difficult year and steeled themselves for another. Many of those in the modest crowd perusing stands stocked with plants, vegetables, baked goods and other items did not appear overly concerned about the virus: At least half were not wearing masks, but were holding them in their hands or tucking them under their chins instead. Still, their comments told a more nuanced story. Bruce Perry, 72, of Coney Island, browsed the market’s offerings while heading to Paragon Sports on the square’s north side. The Omicron variant’s prevalence had dampened his New Year’s Eve mood. “I’m a little depressed,” he said. “I’m tired of wearing this mask every day.” He added that he had just started to feel comfortable being outside without it. “But I know we got to wear it with everything going on,” he said. “We’ve got to learn to live with it.” Mr. Perry, who is vaccinated and has gotten a booster shot, said he had been careful to avoid large crowds and had recently canceled a trip to Atlanta to visit his two daughters and three grandchildren. “I’ll just have to wait,” he said. “I don’t want to get sick, and I don’t want them to get sick.” “Hopefully 2022 will be better,” he added. “It doesn’t look like it’s getting any better.” George Martin was also on the square’s north side, playing Nat King Cole’s “Nature Boy” and “Maria” from West Side Story on his trumpet as a few passers-by dropped dollar bills in his small gray duffle bag while wishing him a Happy New Year. A 71-year-old retiree who lives on Manhattan’s Upper East Side and busks in the parks several days a week, Mr. Martin said he was sure 2022 would bring its share of problems, but that was no reason to stop living. “There’s a lot of confusion right now about Omicron, but what are you going to do?” he said. “Lock yourself in your room? Life is too short.” Soph Ehrlich, 27, a social worker, said they were weary of the pandemic and frustrated by how it had affected the poor families they work with. Still, Mx. Ehrlich, who grew up on East 15th Street and now lives in Oakland, Calif., said the sense of community that had developed over the past 12 months was encouraging. “I’m tired, but I don’t feel hopeless.” Mx. Erlich said. “I have trust in people to take care of one another.” In Brooklyn, the mood was also muted outside Woodhull Hospital Center, a city-run facility straddling the Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhoods where the line to get a P.C.R. test ran along a fenced-in driveway. Sulphina Bennett was among those who were waiting. Ms. Bennett, 39, said she had gotten sick with Covid-19 in January and had gotten vaccinated after that. So when a rapid test came back positive after she spent Christmas with her parents, she decided to get another opinion. “I’m doing this just to make sure,” Ms. Bennett, wearing an overcoat and floral-print mask, said from her place near the front of the line. She said she had been waiting for 90 minutes. Ms. Bennett said she felt like she had a mild cold. But she was not taking her symptoms lightly. A colleague died of Covid earlier in the pandemic, she said. Another had it now. “It’s like all of us are getting it one by one,” she said. The wait for tests was about 30 minutes at a city-run health clinic in a parking lot next to the Brooklyn Queens Expressway in Fort Greene. Those who were waiting included Stacey Campbell, Adam Szlachetka and their 2-year-old daughter, Noa, who started prekindergarten in September. “This is the first time she’s had to specifically test for school,” Ms. Campbell, 39, said. “I don’t know if it’s going to be regular but we did get an email saying, ‘Every child, get a test before coming back on the 4th.’” She said that tests for herself and Mr. Szlachetka, 42, were precautionary. “We’ve been lucky,” Ms. Campbell said. Both are vaccinated and neither has gotten the virus. But word that Ms. Campbell’s mother had been exposed to someone who was infected threw a scare into the family’s Christmas, setting off a frantic round of testing and online reading. “We were waiting til the last minute to see if my mom could come for Christmas,” Ms. Campbell said. “We all made it. Her and her husband had to eat in the hallway.” “Other than that,” she added with laugh, “we were all together.” As for New Year’s plans, Ms. Campbell said, “We’re going to make a champagne cocktail and get tested and feel good about that. And hope for a better 2022.” By 4 p.m., those intent on welcoming the new year at or near this year’s scaled-back version of the traditional Times Square New Year’s Eve celebration had begun to gather. Several hundred people stood on the south side of police barricades at 38th Street and Seventh Avenue, waiting to enter the section where the festivities would be held or lingering to get a distant look as the night unfolded. More than a year after Covid waylaid their grand plans, the owners of Gage & Tollner, a century-old Brooklyn chophouse that closed in 2004, reopened the doors on Fulton Street in April 2021 after a restoration of the historic site. As this difficult year came to a close, their eatery — which had been the site of an Arby’s and a TGI Fridays in the years since the previous owners closed Gage & Tollner — was recognized on several lists of New York’s best new restaurants. “We’re pretty completely proud,” said Sohui Kim, the chef partner who revitalized the spot with her husband, Ben Schneider, and St. John Frizell. “Obviously, we had to go through hoops and hurdles and really deal with all that the world dealt with in terms of Covid.” And as with the world, the year did not end without more hurdles to leap. The arrival of Omicron turned a planned brief Christmas break into a 10-day closure, until Gage reopened on Wednesday in time for New Year’s Eve. The city’s rules on mask-wearing, which had been relaxed when the pandemic eased, have been imposed yet again, and the staff is required to wear them at all times. About 30 percent of those who signed up for five-course prix fixe pampering tonight canceled. But Ms. Kim said that they hope to have more than 100 guests to toast in the New Year. Ms. Kim is back at work after herself enduring a bout of Covid over Christmas. Despite the pandemic, she and Mr. Schneider have kept afloat another business they own, Insa, a Korean barbecue and karaoke restaurant in Gowanus. But in 2022 they will have to figure out what to do with the spot where they closed the Good Fork in Red Hook at the start of the pandemic. In the meantime, they have used it as a pop-up space for aspiring young chefs such as Leland Yu. Their partner, Mr. Frizell, recently announced he would close Fort Defiance, another Red Hook spot which he had transformed during the pandemic from a restaurant into a gourmet grocery store, with hopes of reopening in the spring. “My hope for 2022 is that we could somehow see this Covid experience in the rearview mirror, and if that happens in 2022, that would be beyond awesome,” Ms. Kim said. “But we’re still in it, trying to pivot and figure out what to do.” With the news that South Africa has now passed the peak of its coronavirus cases caused by the Omicron variant, scientists are projecting that the United States’ sharp increase in cases will crest as soon as the middle of January. Over the past month the Omicron variant has spread around the world with astonishing speed, even among people who are vaccinated or who had recovered from previous infections. On Thursday the United States surpassed 580,000 cases, beating the record set only a day before. That is believed to be a vast undercount, because of testing shortages, the popularity of at-home tests and reporting delays over the holidays. What’s more, a significant number of people may have asymptomatic infections and never know it. New estimates from researchers at Columbia University suggest that the United States could peak by Jan. 9 at around 2.5 million cases per week, though that number may go as high as 5.4 million. In New York City, the first U.S. metropolis to see a major surge, the researchers estimated that cases would peak by the first week of the new year. “It’s shocking. It’s disturbing,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist who led the Columbia modeling work. “We’re seeing unprecedented numbers of Covid-19 cases.” The variant is significantly milder than Delta and other versions of the virus, and is far less likely to lead to hospitalizations, according to data from South Africa and preliminary data from Britain released on Friday. Still, the enormous numbers of people getting simultaneously infected could greatly strain hospitals, experts said, especially in places with lower vaccination rates or in places where hospitals are already overburdened. Just how much of a burden the variant will be, however, depends on how quickly it will burn out in particular communities, especially in large cities. Those complex transmission dynamics have been maddeningly difficult to predict with precision. Another model, released by a research group from the University of Washington last week, estimated that the United States would reach a peak in cases by the end of January. But even those researchers are now rethinking their projections based on Omicron’s rapid spread. “We are realizing right now monitoring the data that the peak is going to come much faster,” said Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington. “My guess is it will happen before mid-January.” The numbers are increasing so quickly that some epidemiologists say modeling isn’t even necessary to see where things are headed, said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “The context for all of this is that hospitals are struggling,” Dr. Hanage said. “We don’t have that much spare capacity. And of course, Omicron makes that worse.” There are some reasons to think that the variant’s behavior in the United States might be different than in other countries. In South Africa, for example, the population is much younger, and a large proportion had been infected by earlier waves of the virus. In Britain, the vaccination rate for older people is much higher than in the United States. While South Africa saw a rapid increase in cases followed by a sharp decline, it’s unclear whether cases will crest in the United States in a similar fashion. Because of the number of unknowns, including the emergence of new variants and government restrictions aimed at curbing transmission, Shaman’s group limits its projections to four to six weeks in the future. Two things can cause new infections to decline, according to Natalie Dean, an epidemiologist at Emory University. The biggest contributor is that the virus can burn through people in certain communities, especially dense cities; when it stops finding people to infect, new cases decline. People may also change their behaviors, whether through societal restrictions or on their own, giving the virus fewer opportunities to find them. “Our communities are complicated — it doesn’t mean that everyone in the community has gotten infected,” Dr. Dean said. “It’s kind of the people who are most connected.” The United States could also see more localized outbreaks, with cases beginning to decline in current hot spots, like New York City and Washington D.C., just as they’re beginning to take off elsewhere. That could lead to more of a rounded peak instead of a sharp turnaround, Dr. Shaman said. Nearly 600,000 public university students in New York will soon be required to get vaccination booster shots as part of the state’s stepped-up effort to combat a record-breaking coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on Friday. In addition, State University of New York and City University of New York faculty members will now be subject to a vaccination requirement, and a statewide mask mandate that is already in effect will be extended until at least the end of January, Ms. Hochul said at a morning news briefing. The governor unveiled the measures, part of a broader plan labeled “Winter Surge 2.0,” as the fast-spreading Omicron variant continued to push the number of virus cases in the state to new heights with each passing day. On Thursday, the state reported 74,000 new cases of the virus; about 44,000 were in New York City. On Friday, Ms. Hochul announced 76,000 new cases, with the New York City region having the most per capita. The positivity rate for tests was 16 percent statewide, she said. “We are breaking records every day, and we will continue to do so until we hit that downward trend,” the governor said. Hospitalizations linked to the virus have also risen sharply, to almost 8,000 across the state. About half were in New York City. Twenty-one hospitals in the state have suspended elective surgeries as a result of the rise in virus patients. Ms. Hochul called the increase in hospitalizations “very concerning” while speaking at the briefing. “They are putting a lot of stress on an already overtaxed health care system,” she said. To help address the problem, the governor said the state would be releasing more ventilation machines from its stockpile and dispatching additional members of the National Guard to hospitals that are especially overtaxed. The booster requirement for SUNY and CUNY students, which takes effect Jan. 15, reflects Ms. Hochul’s desire to keep the state’s public education system operating with in-person classes at all levels despite the Omicron-driven outbreak. Dozens of colleges and universities in the United States have already taken such a step. New York’s public university students will also be required to show a negative Covid-19 test result when they return to campus, and masks will be mandatory indoors, Ms. Hochul said. As part of her drive to keep schools open and avoid what she has called last year’s “failed experiment” in remote learning, the governor said that more than five million rapid test kits would be provided to school districts serving students from kindergarten to 12th grade. The goal in distributing the kits is to allow for “test-to-stay” policies under which a student takes two rapid tests if a classmate tests positive. If the tests come back negative, the student can remain in school, she said. As for the mask mandate, New York State has had one in place since Dec. 13 for all indoor public places, including offices, building lobbies and stores. Businesses can opt out if they require full vaccination for everyone 12 and older. Children 5 to 11 must have at least one vaccine dose. Ms. Hochul originally said the mask mandate would end on Jan. 15, but on Friday she extended it through the end of January because of the soaring virus case numbers. New York’s fight to contain the virus is also drawing reinforcements from the federal government, which is deploying disaster response units to the state, sending 50 ambulance teams to New York City and dispatching emergency medical teams to SUNY Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse and the Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo, officials said."

The wildfires came unusually late in the year for Colorado, where severe drought conditions in recent months have set the stage for such blazes to easily spread. As the sky above Boulder County turned orange on Thursday, ash swirled in the wind and buildings were engulfed in flames. The local authorities announced evacuation orders for Superior and Louisville, and for some residents of Broomfield and Westminster. All of those communities lie between Boulder and Denver, the state capital. Traffic was heavy in some areas as residents fled approaching flames. “It’s really smoky, and there are some areas where it’s been hard to breathe outside, and you can see flames depending on where you’re at in the city,” Emily Hogan, a spokeswoman for Louisville, said on Thursday. “The situation is continuing to evolve rapidly and we want everyone to be prepared to take action, if needed.” Gov. Jared Polis declared a state of emergency, allowing the state to tap emergency funds and to deploy state resources, including the Colorado National Guard. He said wind gusts of up to 110 miles per hour had pushed the fires with astonishing speed across suburban subdivisions. “This fire is, frankly, a force of nature,” Mr. Polis said at a news conference on Thursday. “For those who have lost everything that they’ve had, know that we will be there for you to help rebuild your lives.” The fires started on Thursday morning, officials said, and more than 1,600 acres had burned by the evening. The specific cause was unclear as of early Friday morning. Though a number of small blazes burned through Boulder County, some converged into two larger ones that state authorities named the Marshall and Middle Fork fires. The Marshall unleashed the most damage. Sheriff Joe Pelle of Boulder County described the fires on Thursday as a “horrific event.” He said he believed both of the main fires had been caused by downed power lines and said he would not be surprised if there were deaths or injuries. As of Thursday night, only one minor injury had been reported: a police officer who got debris in his eye. As several communities were warning their residents to prepare to evacuate on Thursday night, the National Weather Service reported good news: The high wind warnings in the Boulder area had all been canceled, even though some gusty winds remained. The police in Broomfield lifted an evacuation order for the city just before midnight local time. The three communities where evacuation orders were still in place early Friday have a combined population of more than 150,000, including about 116,000 people who live in Westminster. The fires left thousands of people anxiously wondering if their homes would survive the night, and disrupted essential services across several counties. Avista Adventist Hospital, a 114-bed hospital in Louisville, said on Thursday that it had evacuated its intensive care units and its emergency department, moving patients to two other hospitals. Staff members were sheltering in place and nearby roads were closed, the hospital said. And Xcel Energy, a utility company with millions of customers in Colorado and other states, said on Thursday afternoon that high winds had caused outages in the Boulder area. The company said it was also intentionally cutting power in some areas because wildfires had affected its natural gas infrastructure. As midnight neared, the company said it was ending the controlled outages but that its crews would work overnight and into Friday to restore power to other homes. John Stein was walking his dog in Superior, Colo., on Thursday afternoon when he saw smoke in the area and heard sirens. He jumped in his car and drove to the top of a hill, where he saw smoke billowing below. “It was astounding,” he said. People who had gathered on the hilltop to watch the smoke quickly grew frantic and rushed back to their homes. He stopped at his house to grab dog food, medicine and some essential documents before hitting the road. Mr. Stein, 43, was among tens of thousands of people in the Denver suburbs who were driven from their homes by wildfires on Thursday. All 33,000 residents of Superior and nearby Louisville were forced to evacuate on Thursday afternoon. Residents in parts of Broomfield and Westminster were also ordered to evacuate. The evacuees fled the fire zones under plumes of smoke that clouded the sky for miles, not knowing if their houses would make it through the night. Roads and highways in the Denver metro area were jammed with thousands of residents trying to flee. “It took us almost an hour to get out of our neighborhood — it was complete gridlock,” Mr. Stein said. A few hours after Joe Miller heard sirens in Superior, he and his wife decided it was time to leave. They grabbed some essential items and battled the winds as they left the house. “As we were loading the kids into the car, the winds blew her into the door,” he said. He had to chase after his wife’s shoes after the wind swept them off the ground. Mr. Miller, 32, was planning to drive down to New Mexico, where his family was about to go on vacation, he said. But they stopped in Denver after it became clear that this was not just any fire. “I almost chuckled to myself at the time that we’re being overly safe,” he said. “But as we traveled, we started getting word that people’s houses were falling.” The Millers took shelter at his uncle’s house, where they spent the evening flipping between news channels — and hoping, he said, that they would not have to watch their house burn on TV. Thomas Maxwell, 25, said he did not know on Thursday if his parents’ house in Louisville was still standing. Mr. Maxwell, who lives in California, had been dogsitting for them while they vacationed in Spain. He woke them with a midnight call to say that he had evacuated to a hotel with their two dogs. “It was crazy how fast it happened,” Maxwell said. “I read about wildfires in California all the time. Now I’m experiencing it. It’s so different.” He and other evacuees were gathering information any way they could — scrolling Twitter, swapping photos of nearby landmarks with neighbors — as they tried to calculate the fire’s location. Marcia Van Eden and her husband, John, were also carefully watching news reports from a hotel room to see whether their Superior home had been claimed by the blazes. Late Thursday, the flames were “starting to head up the hill toward our house,” Ms. Van Eden said. “It’s just a waiting game.” While the threat of wildfires looms as a constant threat over Western mountain towns and homes tucked into the woods, people who fled the smoke and flying embers on Thursday were astonished at how the fast-moving blazes had raged through their suburban neighborhoods. “When does this happen in such a suburban area?” asked Alli Bowdey, a nurse who left her home in the Boulder suburb of Louisville and packed into a friend’s house with other evacuated family members. “We grew up with friends losing their homes in the mountains. What happens here? Nothing.” But wildfires in the American West have been worsening — growing larger, spreading faster and reaching into mountainous elevations that were once too wet and cool to have supported fierce fires. What was once a seasonal phenomenon has become a year-round menace, with fires burning later into the fall and into the winter. Recent research has suggested that heat and dryness associated with global warming are major reasons for the increase in bigger and stronger fires, as rainfall patterns have been disrupted, snow melts earlier and meadows and forests are scorched into kindling. Colorado had the three largest wildfires in its history in the summer of 2020, each one burning more than 200,000 acres, Gov. Jared Polis said. But those fires burned federally owned forests and land, he said, while the fires on Thursday destroyed suburban subdevelopments and shopping plazas. “As a millennial, I’m just looking outside and I’m seeing climate change,” said Angelica Kalika, 36, of Broomfield. “I’m seeing my future. I grew up in Colorado, and this is a place where I’ve had snowy Christmases and a nice 60-degree summer. But, for me, this is a moment of deep reckoning of climate change when there is a wildfire outside my door.” Across the Boulder area, displaced neighbors pored over the news for updates on whether their homes had survived and compared notes on businesses where they had seen fires scorching parking lots and approaching buildings. A city recreation center. A Chuck E. Cheese. A grocery store. Normally, businesses like these, surrounded by asphalt and concrete, are protected from wildfires. But weeks of warm, dry weather that stretched from the autumn through December turned communities across the plains of Colorado into a wintertime tinderbox, and the frenzied winds on Thursday created a firestorm that left few places safe. “It’s popping up all over the place,” Ms. Bowdey said. “These embers are flying all over the place. It’s a shock to everybody. Nobody wakes up planning for this.” At about 5:30 p.m., she said she got an update from a neighbor. The fire was now two blocks away from their home. Ruthie Werner, 45, an artist and designer who lives in Louisville, Colo., had been quarantining with her family after her husband contracted Covid-19. But on Thursday, after she and her son and daughter tested negative, they decided to drive to Target to do some Christmas returns and shake off their cabin fever. When they got there, the parking lot was in flames. Smoke was staining the air, and every small patch of grass or vegetation Ms. Werner could see was ablaze. “It felt like the apocalypse,” Ms. Werner said. They drove back home and quickly decided to pack up even before the mandatory evacuations came down. Her children grabbed a few Christmas gifts, and her daughter grabbed a painting of their old family dog. And they bolted for a hotel as far from the smoke and flames as they could. “We just wanted to get out of the smoke,” Ms. Werner said. “We couldn’t breathe. Our eyes were watering. My daughter kept saying her eyes were hurting.” They and neighbors were checking in on their homes remotely through doorbell cameras, and Ms. Werner said her family’s house still appeared to be standing on Thursday evening. But other neighbors had watched through security cameras as flames swallowed up their houses. “If the wind could just stop,” she said from the airport hotel room where she and her family is spending the night. But the images of billowing smoke on the television suggested it still was not slowing down. For shoppers in nearby Superior, a Costco run also turned into an evacuation as flames came dangerously close to the store around noon on Thursday. Robert Gutierrez, 20, had seen smoke billowing on his way to the Costco, but the fire had not reached the store yet, he said. However, five minutes into his shopping trip, the shoppers were asked to evacuate. He could barely see through the smoke as he drove away, he said, when a truck driver coming in the opposite direction gestured at him to turn around. As he did, a trail of flames tore through the road just in front of his car and reached his windshield. “Thankfully, I exited out,” he said. The fast-moving wildfires in Colorado on Thursday that forced tens of thousands of people to flee and destroyed hundreds of homes were a sobering reminder that wildfires have become a year-round phenomenon in the American West. It is never too early to plan for a potential evacuation, even if you are not in an area immediately affected by smoke or flames. Wildfires can spread very quickly, move erratically and travel great distances — especially when driven by the wind, as Thursday’s fires were, experts say. Here are some suggestions to prepare for such an emergency. Make a plan. Families should set a meeting point in case they get separated and map at least two evacuation routes. Prepare an emergency supply kit. Think beyond a flashlight, batteries, and food and water. Cal Fire, the firefighting agency in California, a state that records thousands of wildfires a year, recommends gathering a three-day supply of nonperishable food and three gallons of water per person. Also pack a change of clothes, prescription medications and extra eyeglasses or contact lenses. If you have pets, do not forget about pet food and medication. Keep important documents together. Gather birth certificates, property titles, insurance records and other crucial paperwork. In addition to being difficult to replace, some of the documents could be needed to file claims after the fire. Prepare your home. If you have time, move flammable items like wood piles, brush and propane tanks at least 30 feet away from your house. Shut all windows and doors, but leave them unlocked once you evacuate, so firefighters can get in. Turn on outdoor lights so firefighters can see the house through the smoke. Shut off the gas at the meter, and turn off the air-conditioning. Fuel up. Keep the family car topped off with gas to avoid any delays. Go to the ATM. Cash is key after emergencies. Keep your credit cards handy, too. Tune in to local media. There is no better source for information on evacuation orders, routes and shelters, said Brandi Richard, public affairs officer for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “Monitoring their websites is really important, because as things come in, they’re sharing them on social media.” You do not need to wait for an order. This is especially true in densely populated areas where there may be traffic jams. Pack a “go bag.” Make sure you have the essentials, especially if you can’t get to your emergency supply kit. Denver’s Office of Emergency Management suggests you pack the following: medicine, important documents, clothes, cash, a blanket, face masks, hand sanitizer water and snacks. Grab your electronics. Cellphones, personal computers, backup hard drives and chargers should all go into the car, along with the emergency kit, personal documents, family keepsakes, cash and credit cards. Don’t forget the pets. They will be scared. Be smart in the car. Close your windows and use recirculated air-conditioning. Tune in to local radio to hear about safe routes."

There was anticipation for vaccines, followed by confusing rollouts. Then, we saw some hope as many Americans were inoculated, only to find new variants, a tumultuous news cycle and widespread confusion around the bend. The good news is that people across the country — including experts, public figures and kids — started talking more openly and helpfully about the importance of mental health. Here at Well, we offered tools to stay balanced in the face of so much stress and anxiety. As the year comes to a close, we’ve collected the top pieces of advice from our most popular mental health stories to help you carry calm and clarity into 2022. Back in April, Adam Grant had already called it; he said, “Languishing might be the dominant emotion of 2021.” People certainly knew they were feeling some kind of way, but it wasn’t burnout or depression or even boredom. “Languishing is the neglected middle child of mental health,” Dr. Grant wrote. “It’s the void between depression and flourishing — the absence of well-being.” He provided some tips to cure languishing, but the powerful first step Dr. Grant proposed was simply naming the feeling. Doing so gave us “a clearer window into what had been a blurry experience,” he wrote, and a socially acceptable response to the question: “How are you?”"

Listed on those ballots are two players in their 10th and final year of Hall of Fame eligibility who truly dominated their era but haven’t been voted in: Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens. Undoubtedly, this is because toward the end of their careers, both men faced allegations that they had used performance-enhancing drugs (P.E.D.s) banned by their sport. But as a federal agent who investigated both men for years and, as The New York Times reported in 2007, “dug up the evidence that a grand jury used” to indict Bonds on charges related to those allegations, I’ve come to this conclusion: Bonds and Clemens played at a time when the widespread abuse of P.E.D.s in baseball was a result of a collective failure — of Major League Baseball, teams, players, the players’ union, the media and even the fans. To varying degrees, a lot of us were complicit in sitting back and watching the hitting and pitching marvels of that time and turning a mostly blind eye. When evidence was presented during Bonds’s and Clemens’s federal criminal trials, they and other players wound up bearing the brunt of that collective failure and the selective aftermath, and, unfairly, they still are. (Bonds’s 2011 obstruction of justice conviction was overturned in 2015; in 2012, Clemens was acquitted of all charges related to his 2008 congressional testimony.)"

Wade virtually a dead letter in the state. Even worse, a Supreme Court decision that’s expected this summer is likely to either gut Roe or overturn the precedent altogether, paving the way for total abortion bans in about half the states around the country. If the high court refuses to uphold abortion rights for all Americans and with Congress hopelessly stalemated over legislation that would codify a federal right to abortion, the Biden administration can and should act boldly to protect abortion access. But it will require some outside-the-box thinking — and a willingness to experiment with tactics that may well fail. If President Biden supports abortion as a critical right, as he has suggested, then he and his administration must take risks and get creative in pursuit of that goal. The anti-abortion movement has repeatedly pushed the envelope without fear of defeat. It’s time for activists and politicians who support abortion rights to do the same."

The wildfires came unusually late in the year for Colorado, where severe drought conditions in recent months have set the stage for such blazes to easily spread. As the sky above Boulder County turned orange on Thursday, ash swirled in the wind and buildings were engulfed in flames. The local authorities announced evacuation orders for Superior and Louisville, and for some residents of Broomfield and Westminster. All of those communities lie between Boulder and Denver, the state capital. Traffic was heavy in some areas as residents fled approaching flames. “It’s really smoky, and there are some areas where it’s been hard to breathe outside, and you can see flames depending on where you’re at in the city,” Emily Hogan, a spokeswoman for Louisville, said on Thursday. “The situation is continuing to evolve rapidly and we want everyone to be prepared to take action, if needed.” Gov. Jared Polis declared a state of emergency, allowing the state to tap emergency funds and to deploy state resources, including the Colorado National Guard. He said wind gusts of up to 110 miles per hour had pushed the fires with astonishing speed across suburban subdivisions. “This fire is, frankly, a force of nature,” Mr. Polis said at a news conference on Thursday. “For those who have lost everything that they’ve had, know that we will be there for you to help rebuild your lives.” The fires started on Thursday morning, officials said, and more than 1,600 acres had burned by the evening. The specific cause was unclear as of early Friday morning. Though a number of small blazes burned through Boulder County, some converged into two larger ones that state authorities named the Marshall and Middle Fork fires. The Marshall unleashed the most damage. Sheriff Joe Pelle of Boulder County described the fires on Thursday as a “horrific event.” He said he believed both of the main fires had been caused by downed power lines and said he would not be surprised if there were deaths or injuries. As of Thursday night, only one minor injury had been reported: a police officer who got debris in his eye. As several communities were warning their residents to prepare to evacuate on Thursday night, the National Weather Service reported good news: The high wind warnings in the Boulder area had all been canceled, even though some gusty winds remained. The police in Broomfield lifted an evacuation order for the city just before midnight local time. The three communities where evacuation orders were still in place early Friday have a combined population of more than 150,000, including about 116,000 people who live in Westminster. The fires left thousands of people anxiously wondering if their homes would survive the night, and disrupted essential services across several counties. Avista Adventist Hospital, a 114-bed hospital in Louisville, said on Thursday that it had evacuated its intensive care units and its emergency department, moving patients to two other hospitals. Staff members were sheltering in place and nearby roads were closed, the hospital said. And Xcel Energy, a utility company with millions of customers in Colorado and other states, said on Thursday afternoon that high winds had caused outages in the Boulder area. The company said it was also intentionally cutting power in some areas because wildfires had affected its natural gas infrastructure. As midnight neared, the company said it was ending the controlled outages but that its crews would work overnight and into Friday to restore power to other homes. John Stein was walking his dog in Superior, Colo., on Thursday afternoon when he saw smoke in the area and heard sirens. He jumped in his car and drove to the top of a hill, where he saw smoke billowing below. “It was astounding,” he said. People who had gathered on the hilltop to watch the smoke quickly grew frantic and rushed back to their homes. He stopped at his house to grab dog food, medicine and some essential documents before hitting the road. Mr. Stein, 43, was among tens of thousands of people in the Denver suburbs who were driven from their homes by wildfires on Thursday. All 33,000 residents of Superior and nearby Louisville were forced to evacuate on Thursday afternoon. Residents in parts of Broomfield and Westminster were also ordered to evacuate. The evacuees fled the fire zones under plumes of smoke that clouded the sky for miles, not knowing if their houses would make it through the night. Roads and highways in the Denver metro area were jammed with thousands of residents trying to flee. “It took us almost an hour to get out of our neighborhood — it was complete gridlock,” Mr. Stein said. A few hours after Joe Miller heard sirens in Superior, he and his wife decided it was time to leave. They grabbed some essential items and battled the winds as they left the house. “As we were loading the kids into the car, the winds blew her into the door,” he said. He had to chase after his wife’s shoes after the wind swept them off the ground. Mr. Miller, 32, was planning to drive down to New Mexico, where his family was about to go on vacation, he said. But they stopped in Denver after it became clear that this was not just any fire. “I almost chuckled to myself at the time that we’re being overly safe,” he said. “But as we traveled, we started getting word that people’s houses were falling.” The Millers took shelter at his uncle’s house, where they spent the evening flipping between news channels — and hoping, he said, that they would not have to watch their house burn on TV. Thomas Maxwell, 25, said he did not know on Thursday if his parents’ house in Louisville was still standing. Mr. Maxwell, who lives in California, had been dogsitting for them while they vacationed in Spain. He woke them with a midnight call to say that he had evacuated to a hotel with their two dogs. “It was crazy how fast it happened,” Maxwell said. “I read about wildfires in California all the time. Now I’m experiencing it. It’s so different.” He and other evacuees were gathering information any way they could — scrolling Twitter, swapping photos of nearby landmarks with neighbors — as they tried to calculate the fire’s location. Marcia Van Eden and her husband, John, were also carefully watching news reports from a hotel room to see whether their Superior home had been claimed by the blazes. Late Thursday, the flames were “starting to head up the hill toward our house,” Ms. Van Eden said. “It’s just a waiting game.” While the threat of wildfires looms as a constant threat over Western mountain towns and homes tucked into the woods, people who fled the smoke and flying embers on Thursday were astonished at how the fast-moving blazes had raged through their suburban neighborhoods. “When does this happen in such a suburban area?” asked Alli Bowdey, a nurse who left her home in the Boulder suburb of Louisville and packed into a friend’s house with other evacuated family members. “We grew up with friends losing their homes in the mountains. What happens here? Nothing.” But wildfires in the American West have been worsening — growing larger, spreading faster and reaching into mountainous elevations that were once too wet and cool to have supported fierce fires. What was once a seasonal phenomenon has become a year-round menace, with fires burning later into the fall and into the winter. Recent research has suggested that heat and dryness associated with global warming are major reasons for the increase in bigger and stronger fires, as rainfall patterns have been disrupted, snow melts earlier and meadows and forests are scorched into kindling. Colorado had the three largest wildfires in its history in the summer of 2020, each one burning more than 200,000 acres, Gov. Jared Polis said. But those fires burned federally owned forests and land, he said, while the fires on Thursday destroyed suburban subdevelopments and shopping plazas. “As a millennial, I’m just looking outside and I’m seeing climate change,” said Angelica Kalika, 36, of Broomfield. “I’m seeing my future. I grew up in Colorado, and this is a place where I’ve had snowy Christmases and a nice 60-degree summer. But, for me, this is a moment of deep reckoning of climate change when there is a wildfire outside my door.” Across the Boulder area, displaced neighbors pored over the news for updates on whether their homes had survived and compared notes on businesses where they had seen fires scorching parking lots and approaching buildings. A city recreation center. A Chuck E. Cheese. A grocery store. Normally, businesses like these, surrounded by asphalt and concrete, are protected from wildfires. But weeks of warm, dry weather that stretched from the autumn through December turned communities across the plains of Colorado into a wintertime tinderbox, and the frenzied winds on Thursday created a firestorm that left few places safe. “It’s popping up all over the place,” Ms. Bowdey said. “These embers are flying all over the place. It’s a shock to everybody. Nobody wakes up planning for this.” At about 5:30 p.m., she said she got an update from a neighbor. The fire was now two blocks away from their home. Ruthie Werner, 45, an artist and designer who lives in Louisville, Colo., had been quarantining with her family after her husband contracted Covid-19. But on Thursday, after she and her son and daughter tested negative, they decided to drive to Target to do some Christmas returns and shake off their cabin fever. When they got there, the parking lot was in flames. Smoke was staining the air, and every small patch of grass or vegetation Ms. Werner could see was ablaze. “It felt like the apocalypse,” Ms. Werner said. They drove back home and quickly decided to pack up even before the mandatory evacuations came down. Her children grabbed a few Christmas gifts, and her daughter grabbed a painting of their old family dog. And they bolted for a hotel as far from the smoke and flames as they could. “We just wanted to get out of the smoke,” Ms. Werner said. “We couldn’t breathe. Our eyes were watering. My daughter kept saying her eyes were hurting.” They and neighbors were checking in on their homes remotely through doorbell cameras, and Ms. Werner said her family’s house still appeared to be standing on Thursday evening. But other neighbors had watched through security cameras as flames swallowed up their houses. “If the wind could just stop,” she said from the airport hotel room where she and her family is spending the night. But the images of billowing smoke on the television suggested it still was not slowing down. For shoppers in nearby Superior, a Costco run also turned into an evacuation as flames came dangerously close to the store around noon on Thursday. Robert Gutierrez, 20, had seen smoke billowing on his way to the Costco, but the fire had not reached the store yet, he said. However, five minutes into his shopping trip, the shoppers were asked to evacuate. He could barely see through the smoke as he drove away, he said, when a truck driver coming in the opposite direction gestured at him to turn around. As he did, a trail of flames tore through the road just in front of his car and reached his windshield. “Thankfully, I exited out,” he said. The fast-moving wildfires in Colorado on Thursday that forced tens of thousands of people to flee and destroyed hundreds of homes were a sobering reminder that wildfires have become a year-round phenomenon in the American West. It is never too early to plan for a potential evacuation, even if you are not in an area immediately affected by smoke or flames. Wildfires can spread very quickly, move erratically and travel great distances — especially when driven by the wind, as Thursday’s fires were, experts say. Here are some suggestions to prepare for such an emergency. Make a plan. Families should set a meeting point in case they get separated and map at least two evacuation routes. Prepare an emergency supply kit. Think beyond a flashlight, batteries, and food and water. Cal Fire, the firefighting agency in California, a state that records thousands of wildfires a year, recommends gathering a three-day supply of nonperishable food and three gallons of water per person. Also pack a change of clothes, prescription medications and extra eyeglasses or contact lenses. If you have pets, do not forget about pet food and medication. Keep important documents together. Gather birth certificates, property titles, insurance records and other crucial paperwork. In addition to being difficult to replace, some of the documents could be needed to file claims after the fire. Prepare your home. If you have time, move flammable items like wood piles, brush and propane tanks at least 30 feet away from your house. Shut all windows and doors, but leave them unlocked once you evacuate, so firefighters can get in. Turn on outdoor lights so firefighters can see the house through the smoke. Shut off the gas at the meter, and turn off the air-conditioning. Fuel up. Keep the family car topped off with gas to avoid any delays. Go to the ATM. Cash is key after emergencies. Keep your credit cards handy, too. Tune in to local media. There is no better source for information on evacuation orders, routes and shelters, said Brandi Richard, public affairs officer for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “Monitoring their websites is really important, because as things come in, they’re sharing them on social media.” You do not need to wait for an order. This is especially true in densely populated areas where there may be traffic jams. Pack a “go bag.” Make sure you have the essentials, especially if you can’t get to your emergency supply kit. Denver’s Office of Emergency Management suggests you pack the following: medicine, important documents, clothes, cash, a blanket, face masks, hand sanitizer water and snacks. Grab your electronics. Cellphones, personal computers, backup hard drives and chargers should all go into the car, along with the emergency kit, personal documents, family keepsakes, cash and credit cards. Don’t forget the pets. They will be scared. Be smart in the car. Close your windows and use recirculated air-conditioning. Tune in to local radio to hear about safe routes."

The wildfires came unusually late in the year for Colorado, where severe drought conditions in recent months have set the stage for such blazes to easily spread. As the sky above Boulder County turned orange on Thursday, ash swirled in the wind and buildings were engulfed in flames. The local authorities announced evacuation orders for Superior and Louisville, and for some residents of Broomfield and Westminster. All of those communities lie between Boulder and Denver, the state capital. Traffic was heavy in some areas as residents fled approaching flames. “It’s really smoky, and there are some areas where it’s been hard to breathe outside, and you can see flames depending on where you’re at in the city,” Emily Hogan, a spokeswoman for Louisville, said on Thursday. “The situation is continuing to evolve rapidly and we want everyone to be prepared to take action, if needed.” Gov. Jared Polis declared a state of emergency, allowing the state to tap emergency funds and to deploy state resources, including the Colorado National Guard. He said wind gusts of up to 110 miles per hour had pushed the fires with astonishing speed across suburban subdivisions. “This fire is, frankly, a force of nature,” Mr. Polis said at a news conference on Thursday. “For those who have lost everything that they’ve had, know that we will be there for you to help rebuild your lives.” The fires started on Thursday morning, officials said, and more than 1,600 acres had burned by the evening. The specific cause was unclear as of early Friday morning. Though a number of small blazes burned through Boulder County, some converged into two larger ones that state authorities named the Marshall and Middle Fork fires. The Marshall unleashed the most damage. Sheriff Joe Pelle of Boulder County described the fires on Thursday as a “horrific event.” He said he believed both of the main fires had been caused by downed power lines and said he would not be surprised if there were deaths or injuries. As of Thursday night, only one minor injury had been reported: a police officer who got debris in his eye. As several communities were warning their residents to prepare to evacuate on Thursday night, the National Weather Service reported good news: The high wind warnings in the Boulder area had all been canceled, even though some gusty winds remained. The police in Broomfield lifted an evacuation order for the city just before midnight local time. The three communities where evacuation orders were still in place early Friday have a combined population of more than 150,000, including about 116,000 people who live in Westminster. The fires left thousands of people anxiously wondering if their homes would survive the night, and disrupted essential services across several counties. Avista Adventist Hospital, a 114-bed hospital in Louisville, said on Thursday that it had evacuated its intensive care units and its emergency department, moving patients to two other hospitals. Staff members were sheltering in place and nearby roads were closed, the hospital said. And Xcel Energy, a utility company with millions of customers in Colorado and other states, said on Thursday afternoon that high winds had caused outages in the Boulder area. The company said it was also intentionally cutting power in some areas because wildfires had affected its natural gas infrastructure. As midnight neared, the company said it was ending the controlled outages but that its crews would work overnight and into Friday to restore power to other homes. John Stein was walking his dog in Superior, Colo., on Thursday afternoon when he saw smoke in the area and heard sirens. He jumped in his car and drove to the top of a hill, where he saw smoke billowing below. “It was astounding,” he said. People who had gathered on the hilltop to watch the smoke quickly grew frantic and rushed back to their homes. He stopped at his house to grab dog food, medicine and some essential documents before hitting the road. Mr. Stein, 43, was among tens of thousands of people in the Denver suburbs who were driven from their homes by wildfires on Thursday. All 33,000 residents of Superior and nearby Louisville were forced to evacuate on Thursday afternoon. Residents in parts of Broomfield and Westminster were also ordered to evacuate. The evacuees fled the fire zones under plumes of smoke that clouded the sky for miles, not knowing if their houses would make it through the night. Roads and highways in the Denver metro area were jammed with thousands of residents trying to flee. “It took us almost an hour to get out of our neighborhood — it was complete gridlock,” Mr. Stein said. A few hours after Joe Miller heard sirens in Superior, he and his wife decided it was time to leave. They grabbed some essential items and battled the winds as they left the house. “As we were loading the kids into the car, the winds blew her into the door,” he said. He had to chase after his wife’s shoes after the wind swept them off the ground. Mr. Miller, 32, was planning to drive down to New Mexico, where his family was about to go on vacation, he said. But they stopped in Denver after it became clear that this was not just any fire. “I almost chuckled to myself at the time that we’re being overly safe,” he said. “But as we traveled, we started getting word that people’s houses were falling.” The Millers took shelter at his uncle’s house, where they spent the evening flipping between news channels — and hoping, he said, that they would not have to watch their house burn on TV. Thomas Maxwell, 25, said he did not know on Thursday if his parents’ house in Louisville was still standing. Mr. Maxwell, who lives in California, had been dogsitting for them while they vacationed in Spain. He woke them with a midnight call to say that he had evacuated to a hotel with their two dogs. “It was crazy how fast it happened,” Maxwell said. “I read about wildfires in California all the time. Now I’m experiencing it. It’s so different.” He and other evacuees were gathering information any way they could — scrolling Twitter, swapping photos of nearby landmarks with neighbors — as they tried to calculate the fire’s location. Marcia Van Eden and her husband, John, were also carefully watching news reports from a hotel room to see whether their Superior home had been claimed by the blazes. Late Thursday, the flames were “starting to head up the hill toward our house,” Ms. Van Eden said. “It’s just a waiting game.” While the threat of wildfires looms as a constant threat over Western mountain towns and homes tucked into the woods, people who fled the smoke and flying embers on Thursday were astonished at how the fast-moving blazes had raged through their suburban neighborhoods. “When does this happen in such a suburban area?” asked Alli Bowdey, a nurse who left her home in the Boulder suburb of Louisville and packed into a friend’s house with other evacuated family members. “We grew up with friends losing their homes in the mountains. What happens here? Nothing.” But wildfires in the American West have been worsening — growing larger, spreading faster and reaching into mountainous elevations that were once too wet and cool to have supported fierce fires. What was once a seasonal phenomenon has become a year-round menace, with fires burning later into the fall and into the winter. Recent research has suggested that heat and dryness associated with global warming are major reasons for the increase in bigger and stronger fires, as rainfall patterns have been disrupted, snow melts earlier and meadows and forests are scorched into kindling. Colorado had the three largest wildfires in its history in the summer of 2020, each one burning more than 200,000 acres, Gov. Jared Polis said. But those fires burned federally owned forests and land, he said, while the fires on Thursday destroyed suburban subdevelopments and shopping plazas. “As a millennial, I’m just looking outside and I’m seeing climate change,” said Angelica Kalika, 36, of Broomfield. “I’m seeing my future. I grew up in Colorado, and this is a place where I’ve had snowy Christmases and a nice 60-degree summer. But, for me, this is a moment of deep reckoning of climate change when there is a wildfire outside my door.” Across the Boulder area, displaced neighbors pored over the news for updates on whether their homes had survived and compared notes on businesses where they had seen fires scorching parking lots and approaching buildings. A city recreation center. A Chuck E. Cheese. A grocery store. Normally, businesses like these, surrounded by asphalt and concrete, are protected from wildfires. But weeks of warm, dry weather that stretched from the autumn through December turned communities across the plains of Colorado into a wintertime tinderbox, and the frenzied winds on Thursday created a firestorm that left few places safe. “It’s popping up all over the place,” Ms. Bowdey said. “These embers are flying all over the place. It’s a shock to everybody. Nobody wakes up planning for this.” At about 5:30 p.m., she said she got an update from a neighbor. The fire was now two blocks away from their home. Ruthie Werner, 45, an artist and designer who lives in Louisville, Colo., had been quarantining with her family after her husband contracted Covid-19. But on Thursday, after she and her son and daughter tested negative, they decided to drive to Target to do some Christmas returns and shake off their cabin fever. When they got there, the parking lot was in flames. Smoke was staining the air, and every small patch of grass or vegetation Ms. Werner could see was ablaze. “It felt like the apocalypse,” Ms. Werner said. They drove back home and quickly decided to pack up even before the mandatory evacuations came down. Her children grabbed a few Christmas gifts, and her daughter grabbed a painting of their old family dog. And they bolted for a hotel as far from the smoke and flames as they could. “We just wanted to get out of the smoke,” Ms. Werner said. “We couldn’t breathe. Our eyes were watering. My daughter kept saying her eyes were hurting.” They and neighbors were checking in on their homes remotely through doorbell cameras, and Ms. Werner said her family’s house still appeared to be standing on Thursday evening. But other neighbors had watched through security cameras as flames swallowed up their houses. “If the wind could just stop,” she said from the airport hotel room where she and her family is spending the night. But the images of billowing smoke on the television suggested it still was not slowing down. For shoppers in nearby Superior, a Costco run also turned into an evacuation as flames came dangerously close to the store around noon on Thursday. Robert Gutierrez, 20, had seen smoke billowing on his way to the Costco, but the fire had not reached the store yet, he said. However, five minutes into his shopping trip, the shoppers were asked to evacuate. He could barely see through the smoke as he drove away, he said, when a truck driver coming in the opposite direction gestured at him to turn around. As he did, a trail of flames tore through the road just in front of his car and reached his windshield. “Thankfully, I exited out,” he said. The fast-moving wildfires in Colorado on Thursday that forced tens of thousands of people to flee and destroyed hundreds of homes were a sobering reminder that wildfires have become a year-round phenomenon in the American West. It is never too early to plan for a potential evacuation, even if you are not in an area immediately affected by smoke or flames. Wildfires can spread very quickly, move erratically and travel great distances — especially when driven by the wind, as Thursday’s fires were, experts say. Here are some suggestions to prepare for such an emergency. Make a plan. Families should set a meeting point in case they get separated and map at least two evacuation routes. Prepare an emergency supply kit. Think beyond a flashlight, batteries, and food and water. Cal Fire, the firefighting agency in California, a state that records thousands of wildfires a year, recommends gathering a three-day supply of nonperishable food and three gallons of water per person. Also pack a change of clothes, prescription medications and extra eyeglasses or contact lenses. If you have pets, do not forget about pet food and medication. Keep important documents together. Gather birth certificates, property titles, insurance records and other crucial paperwork. In addition to being difficult to replace, some of the documents could be needed to file claims after the fire. Prepare your home. If you have time, move flammable items like wood piles, brush and propane tanks at least 30 feet away from your house. Shut all windows and doors, but leave them unlocked once you evacuate, so firefighters can get in. Turn on outdoor lights so firefighters can see the house through the smoke. Shut off the gas at the meter, and turn off the air-conditioning. Fuel up. Keep the family car topped off with gas to avoid any delays. Go to the ATM. Cash is key after emergencies. Keep your credit cards handy, too. Tune in to local media. There is no better source for information on evacuation orders, routes and shelters, said Brandi Richard, public affairs officer for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “Monitoring their websites is really important, because as things come in, they’re sharing them on social media.” You do not need to wait for an order. This is especially true in densely populated areas where there may be traffic jams. Pack a “go bag.” Make sure you have the essentials, especially if you can’t get to your emergency supply kit. Denver’s Office of Emergency Management suggests you pack the following: medicine, important documents, clothes, cash, a blanket, face masks, hand sanitizer water and snacks. Grab your electronics. Cellphones, personal computers, backup hard drives and chargers should all go into the car, along with the emergency kit, personal documents, family keepsakes, cash and credit cards. Don’t forget the pets. They will be scared. Be smart in the car. Close your windows and use recirculated air-conditioning. Tune in to local radio to hear about safe routes."

In Midtown, Friday night was neon-bright and pleasantly mild, but a bit foggy and soggy, matching the ambivalent mood of a city and a country primed for a change but girding for another year of unexpected setbacks and dashed optimism. Yet there were signs of real cheer. Revelers, sprinkled two-deep behind N.Y.P.D. barricades, seemed stoked and giddy (although alcohol was banned inside the celebration zone); a new mayor, Eric Adams, was taking the oath of office just after midnight; and the final day of 2021 brimmed with encouraging reports that Omicron is, in fact, less lethal than prior waves of the coronavirus. Just before midnight, city officials opened up the barricades to admit hundreds of people who had been shut out of the celebration, adding a jolt of enthusiasm at the start of the new year. But for most of the night, the small, masked and semi-socially-distanced crowd made 2022 the most Groundhog Day of New Year’s Eves, more a throwback to last year’s sparse assemblage than the unbridled bacchanals of prepandemic times. In some places, police officers outnumbered civilians, and aerial shots above Times Square featured more pavement than people, the crowd a quarter of its typical size. Nor did it help that L.L. Cool J and Chlöe, two of the biggest headliners for ABC’s legacy broadcast, “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest,” had to pull out at the last minute after they tested positive. “We were ready and I was really looking forward to ringing in 2022 in my hometown in a special way, but for now I wish everyone a healthy and happy New Year,” L.L. Cool J, who was born in Bay Shore on Long Island, said in a statement. “The best is yet to come!” But Journey played “Don’t Stop Believing,” and the U.S.O. Show Troupe did their best to encourage the troops. Mr. Seacrest, who seemed relieved to be speaking at a normal level after years of shouting to be heard over much larger gatherings, struck his signature sunny tone. He predicted that “all of the hopes and possibilities” of the new year would come to pass. Behind him, a huge marquee flashed an ad for one of the program’s main sponsors, Carnival Cruise Line. On Thursday, a day earlier, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans to “avoid cruise travel regardless of vaccination status” until Omicron reached ebb tide. Similar warnings about the perils of travel during the wildfire stage of the variant did not, however, dissuade visitors who flocked to the ball dropping to experience an apex American tourist moment. Inside a spectator pen, Sebastián de la Torre and Michelle Robayo lay on the pavement early in the evening waiting for the festivities to begin, their heads resting on squishy purple-and-yellow top hats with the logo of a gym chain that everyone was offered as they entered. Their journey from Ecuador to New York was exhausting, and not entirely without sacrifice. Ms. Robayo’s pink backpack was confiscated at the entrance, a reminder of another, continued threat to New Year’s Eve: terrorism. But they managed to salvage the contents, including two little dolls with faces like smiling zombies, called años viejos, or “old years.” At midnight, Ecuadoreans and others in Latin America ritually burn them. “You close the year on all the bad things,” Mr. de la Torre said. “Covid — I got Covid, she did too.” Thousands of revelers shook balloons, danced to music, and shouted cheers during a Times Square New Year’s Eve celebration that came far closer to resembling the prepandemic festivities than last year’s muted affair. Thousands of locals and tourists swayed together under falling confetti to James Brown’s energetic “Living in America” and U2’s mournful anthem “One.” Some paused to reflect on what the night signified to them. Wendy Kahn, 61, a retired special-needs teacher from New Orleans, said she felt an urgent need at the end of a long year to make one of her wishes come true: Spending New Year’s Eve in Times Square. “I love that we can celebrate,” she said. “Seeing the celebrities, the confetti, the lights, it’s the most amazing thing.” Jennifer Gaitan, 33, a kindergarten teacher who lives on the Upper East Side, said that she came to the New Year’s Eve celebration with a hopeful heart after two years of recalibrating her wishes. “In 2020 and 2021 we all had these high expectations, now we have to let come what may,” she said. She added that it was her dream to spend New Year’s Eve in Times Square, because she has seen it so often in movies. “It was my moral imperative to be here,” she said. Michael Bautista traveled from Japan with his wife Hidemi and their 6-year-old daughter, Mayumi. Mr. Bautista said he wanted simply to celebrate after a difficult year. “Be happy, just be happy,” said Mr. Bautista, 31, a financial worker. “Last year we had nothing like this,” said Ms. Bautista, 29. “Despite the pandemic we should be happy.” The biggest safety threat looming over the New Year’s Eve celebration in Times Square in 2021 is the coronavirus, but the perimeter of the event is guarded against a threat that became apparent 20 years ago on Sept. 11: terrorism. All cross streets from 56th Street to 37th Street have been fenced off, with concrete blocks the size of love seats on the sidewalks and dump trucks parked diagonally across the pavement. Sixth Avenue is lined with wooden blockades stenciled with, “Police Line Do Not Cross.” New York Police Department officers have been joined by F.B.I. agents from the Joint Terrorism Task Force, State Police officers, and the department’s Strategic Response officers dressed in helmets and toting long guns. For private businesses for whom official law enforcement was insufficient, there was private security on display. A private security S.U.V. was parked outside a Bryant Park bank branch, and a security guard stood watch outside the Fox News headquarters, where a Christmas tree was set on fire earlier this month. Sharon Sanchez, who owns a security company in Miami, her hometown, said the public safety apparatus on display was a welcome sight on her first visit to New York City. “I think it’s great, it keeps us all safe,” said Ms. Sanchez, 58, who wore one of the purple and yellow top hats that had been handed out to revelers. But Grace Ponce, 25, a nanny from Houston, the show of force did nothing to alleviate her primary concern. “We worry about the virus,” she said. “We know we’re taking a risk.” In Times Square, the rules limiting attendance at the New Year’s Eve festivities to 15,000 — a fraction of the normal herd — seemed to be accomplishing their purpose Thursday evening. Each block had several barricaded areas containing dozens of people apiece, but most of the streets were passable only by police officers and members of the media. Inside a spectator pen, Sebastián de la Torre and Michelle Robayo lay on the pavement, their heads resting on the squishy purple-and-yellow top hats with the logo of a gym chain that everyone was offered as they entered. They were tired, they explained. The couple, visiting New York from Ecuador, had lined up before noon, and the moment the gates were opened, sprinted to a prime viewing spot. “We just left running,” said Mr. de la Torre, 34, an architect in Quito. “They think like we are cows here.” The journey was not without sacrifice. Ms. Robayo’s pink backpack was confiscated at the entrance. “This backpack has been all around the world — Spain, Italy, France, Dubai — and they made her throw it out,” Mr. de la Torre said. He brought up a video on his phone showing Ms. Robayo, 30, giving the backpack a sad goodbye hug. But they salvaged the contents, including two little dolls with faces like smiling zombies, called años viejos, or “old years.” At midnight, Ecuadoreans and others in Latin America ritually burn them. “You close the year on all the bad things,” Mr. de la Torre said. “Covid — I got Covid, she did too.” Not that they would dare actually set fire to something in Times Square. “Maybe they’ll think we’re doing something bad,” Mr. de la Torre said, “so we’ll burn it back home.” An hour later, though, an announcer blasting over the loudspeakers seemed to have channeled them. “2021 may have been a dumpster fire, but we’re making sure that New Year’s Eve 2022 is gonna be lit!” the announcer yelled. A gigantic screen showed a garbage can aflame as the announcer interviewed people about what they hoped to leave behind — chiefly the coronavirus. Behind the barricades north of 47th Street, where people were jammed shoulder to shoulder, Zoé Fauchi said she was scared even though she was excited. “We’re wearing our masks at all times, even while eating,” said Ms. Fauchi, 22, a law student from Normandy, France, waving a Kind bar. “I try to wear it while I’m chewing.” “I think as long as we keep our masks on we will be OK,” she added, though it sounded half like a question. Her friend Emma Marianni, 21 and also a law student, explained that she could not afford to get sick. “We’re supposed to take the plane home tomorrow and we have to get tested,” she said. “If I have Covid I won’t be able to go back to France.” Not that she would mind being stuck in New York. “I actually would like to stay here,” she said, “but I have exams next week.” People who contracted the Omicron variant of the coronavirus were about half as likely to need hospital care as those infected with the Delta variant, and one-third as likely to need emergency care, according to a report issued on Friday by British health officials. The analysis of public data also found that vaccination offers strong protection against hospitalization and severe illness following Omicron infection, helping prevent the worst outcomes even as infection rates in Britain soar to record levels. The findings represent some of the largest sets of real-world data to be released since the highly contagious variant was first discovered in late November, and add to a growing body of evidence that Omicron may not present as great a danger of hospitalization and severe illness to the public as earlier variants. “The latest set of analysis is in keeping with the encouraging signs we have already seen,” said Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at the health security agency. The risk of being admitted to a hospital for Omicron cases was 65 percent lower for those who had received two doses of a vaccine, compared with those who had not received any vaccination. The rate of hospitalization was even lower among those who had received three doses of vaccine, according to the report, which was issued by the U.K. Health Security Agency. People who had received booster doses were 81 percent less likely to be admitted to the hospital, compared with unvaccinated people, according to the agency. The agency analyzed 528,176 Omicron cases and 573,012 Delta cases between Nov. 22 and Dec. 26 to assess the risk of hospitalization in England. The researchers included all cases diagnosed in the community and then assessed the risk of general admission to the hospital or admission through emergency care. In a second study, the agency examined just symptomatic cases, linked with hospitalization data, and found that three doses of a vaccine reduced the risk of hospitalization for people with the Omicron variant by 88 percent, compared with unvaccinated people with that variant. While the world grappled with a bad case of stay-at-home claustrophobia in 2021, I was lucky — or foolish — to travel to four continents. I braved a total of 20 P.C.R. tests in Montreal, London, Lisbon, Toronto, Rio and Seoul, some during which it felt like my cerebellum was being stabbed with a long swab stuck up my nostril. A few other uncherished memories stand out. Among the 20 days I spent in quarantine this past year, one I would like to forget was my night at a quarantine hotel at Toronto’s airport in June. I was escorted to my room by a uniformed security guard as an older man in the elevator sneezed, a mask dangling alarmingly beneath his nose. I twisted and turned anxiously all night, but a subsequent Covid test came back negative. Then there was the nail-biting moment midway through a Lisbon vacation in June when British authorities suddenly removed Portugal from the country’s quarantine-free travel list. That meant I would need to quarantine for 10 days in London, if I didn’t get back before the dreaded status change, and then miss my return flight home, a few days later, to Montreal. I made it — with only a few hours to spare. While I traveled mostly for work and to satisfy my wanderlust, my trips underscored the stresses of traveling at a time when often confusing health orders can change with the speed of a deadly variant. The past year was a turbulent year for global travel, and, with Omicron surging from the United States to France, the immediate outlook for 2022 seems ominous. Many travelers are putting off trips until later in the year. Commercial airlines canceled 4,500 flights around the globe over Christmas weekend. Such was the dire state of travel in 2021 in many places that Bali, long a dream destination, received only a few dozen international visitors. In Britain, the number of visitors by air plunged by 97 percent in the first half of the year, according to the British tourism authority. Stuck at home during travel-imposed quarantines, I became a plant nerd; bought things I didn’t necessarily need, like a stainless steel dental plaque remover set; and gave myself catastrophic home haircuts that made me want to cower inside an extra few weeks. I’ve been fascinated by how different countries and cultures have adapted during a pandemic. When I arrived in London in May, just as a lockdown had lifted, there was a palpable party spirit, with people thronging inside pubs and frolicking in the streets. In South Korea, praised for its early handling of the pandemic, my fellow bikers along the Han River in Seoul studiously wore their masks outside. Come nighttime, however, some office workers compensated for 10 p.m. bar closures with marathon sessions of drinking soju, the popular Korean spirit often distilled from rice, before closing time. While on vacation in body-obsessed Rio, residents and fruit juice sellers crowded the sandy beaches of Ipanema in November, perhaps momentarily putting out of their minds the more than 20 million people reported to have tested positive for the coronavirus in Brazil. But at gyms, people bench-pressed while wearing masks. As for me, I am now back in Montreal, where gyms, bars, movie theaters and spas are closed. On New Year’s Eve, I have big plans to travel — from my bed to my living room. Even as some students were packing to head to campus, Michigan State, Vanderbilt, Miami and Duke have joined the growing list of universities changing their spring semester schedules as Omicron infections spread. In an announcement Friday, Michigan State joined nearly 50 other schools that had already announced either delayed starts or remote classes. The public university in East Lansing, Mich., where classes were scheduled to begin Jan. 10, will go remote for at least three weeks. Samuel L. Stanley, Michigan State’s president, noted what he called an “intense surge” in the virus in a message to the campus on Friday. Vanderbilt University in Nashville announced a delayed start to its spring semester. Classes will start Jan. 17 rather than Jan. 10. Nearby Tennessee State University also announced on Friday that it would not reopen on schedule, delaying classes until Jan. 24. Duke University, in Durham, N.C., extended the time its classes would be virtual, until Jan. 18, and urged students to delay their arrivals to campus even though residence halls were scheduled to open on Jan. 2. In a tweet, the university said that the rate of pandemic-related hospitalizations in North Carolina had doubled. And the University of Miami said its classes, scheduled to begin Jan. 18, would be remote for the first two weeks. The subdued atmosphere caused by the pandemic on what is usually a giddy holiday was evident at the Union Square Greenmarket in Manhattan on an unseasonably warm last day of 2021, as New Yorkers said goodbye to one difficult year and steeled themselves for another. Many of those in the modest crowd perusing stands stocked with plants, vegetables, baked goods and other items did not appear overly concerned about the virus: At least half were not wearing masks, but were holding them in their hands or tucking them under their chins instead. Still, their comments told a more nuanced story. Bruce Perry, 72, of Coney Island, browsed the market’s offerings while heading to Paragon Sports on the square’s north side. The Omicron variant’s prevalence had dampened his New Year’s Eve mood. “I’m a little depressed,” he said. “I’m tired of wearing this mask every day.” He added that he had just started to feel comfortable being outside without it. “But I know we got to wear it with everything going on,” he said. “We’ve got to learn to live with it.” Mr. Perry, who is vaccinated and has gotten a booster shot, said he had been careful to avoid large crowds and had recently canceled a trip to Atlanta to visit his two daughters and three grandchildren. “I’ll just have to wait,” he said. “I don’t want to get sick, and I don’t want them to get sick.” “Hopefully 2022 will be better,” he added. “It doesn’t look like it’s getting any better.” George Martin was also on the square’s north side, playing Nat King Cole’s “Nature Boy” and “Maria” from West Side Story on his trumpet as a few passers-by dropped dollar bills in his small gray duffle bag while wishing him a Happy New Year. A 71-year-old retiree who lives on Manhattan’s Upper East Side and busks in the parks several days a week, Mr. Martin said he was sure 2022 would bring its share of problems, but that was no reason to stop living. “There’s a lot of confusion right now about Omicron, but what are you going to do?” he said. “Lock yourself in your room? Life is too short.” Soph Ehrlich, 27, a social worker, said they were weary of the pandemic and frustrated by how it had affected the poor families they work with. Still, Mx. Ehrlich, who grew up on East 15th Street and now lives in Oakland, Calif., said the sense of community that had developed over the past 12 months was encouraging. “I’m tired, but I don’t feel hopeless.” Mx. Erlich said. “I have trust in people to take care of one another.” In Brooklyn, the mood was also muted outside Woodhull Hospital Center, a city-run facility straddling the Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhoods where the line to get a P.C.R. test ran along a fenced-in driveway. Sulphina Bennett was among those who were waiting. Ms. Bennett, 39, said she had gotten sick with Covid-19 in January and had gotten vaccinated after that. So when a rapid test came back positive after she spent Christmas with her parents, she decided to get another opinion. “I’m doing this just to make sure,” Ms. Bennett, wearing an overcoat and floral-print mask, said from her place near the front of the line. She said she had been waiting for 90 minutes. Ms. Bennett said she felt like she had a mild cold. But she was not taking her symptoms lightly. A colleague died of Covid earlier in the pandemic, she said. Another had it now. “It’s like all of us are getting it one by one,” she said. The wait for tests was about 30 minutes at a city-run health clinic in a parking lot next to the Brooklyn Queens Expressway in Fort Greene. Those who were waiting included Stacey Campbell, Adam Szlachetka and their 2-year-old daughter, Noa, who started prekindergarten in September. “This is the first time she’s had to specifically test for school,” Ms. Campbell, 39, said. “I don’t know if it’s going to be regular but we did get an email saying, ‘Every child, get a test before coming back on the 4th.’” She said that tests for herself and Mr. Szlachetka, 42, were precautionary. “We’ve been lucky,” Ms. Campbell said. Both are vaccinated and neither has gotten the virus. But word that Ms. Campbell’s mother had been exposed to someone who was infected threw a scare into the family’s Christmas, setting off a frantic round of testing and online reading. “We were waiting til the last minute to see if my mom could come for Christmas,” Ms. Campbell said. “We all made it. Her and her husband had to eat in the hallway.” “Other than that,” she added with laugh, “we were all together.” As for New Year’s plans, Ms. Campbell said, “We’re going to make a champagne cocktail and get tested and feel good about that. And hope for a better 2022.” By 4 p.m., those intent on welcoming the new year at or near this year’s scaled-back version of the traditional Times Square New Year’s Eve celebration had begun to gather. Several hundred people stood on the south side of police barricades at 38th Street and Seventh Avenue, waiting to enter the section where the festivities would be held or lingering to get a distant look as the night unfolded. More than a year after Covid waylaid their grand plans, the owners of Gage & Tollner, a century-old Brooklyn chophouse that closed in 2004, reopened the doors on Fulton Street in April 2021 after a restoration of the historic site. As this difficult year came to a close, their eatery — which had been the site of an Arby’s and a TGI Fridays in the years since the previous owners closed Gage & Tollner — was recognized on several lists of New York’s best new restaurants. “We’re pretty completely proud,” said Sohui Kim, the chef partner who revitalized the spot with her husband, Ben Schneider, and St. John Frizell. “Obviously, we had to go through hoops and hurdles and really deal with all that the world dealt with in terms of Covid.” And as with the world, the year did not end without more hurdles to leap. The arrival of Omicron turned a planned brief Christmas break into a 10-day closure, until Gage reopened on Wednesday in time for New Year’s Eve. The city’s rules on mask-wearing, which had been relaxed when the pandemic eased, have been imposed yet again, and the staff is required to wear them at all times. About 30 percent of those who signed up for five-course prix fixe pampering tonight canceled. But Ms. Kim said that they hope to have more than 100 guests to toast in the New Year. Ms. Kim is back at work after herself enduring a bout of Covid over Christmas. Despite the pandemic, she and Mr. Schneider have kept afloat another business they own, Insa, a Korean barbecue and karaoke restaurant in Gowanus. But in 2022 they will have to figure out what to do with the spot where they closed the Good Fork in Red Hook at the start of the pandemic. In the meantime, they have used it as a pop-up space for aspiring young chefs such as Leland Yu. Their partner, Mr. Frizell, recently announced he would close Fort Defiance, another Red Hook spot which he had transformed during the pandemic from a restaurant into a gourmet grocery store, with hopes of reopening in the spring. “My hope for 2022 is that we could somehow see this Covid experience in the rearview mirror, and if that happens in 2022, that would be beyond awesome,” Ms. Kim said. “But we’re still in it, trying to pivot and figure out what to do.” With the news that South Africa has now passed the peak of its coronavirus cases caused by the Omicron variant, scientists are projecting that the United States’ sharp increase in cases will crest as soon as the middle of January. Over the past month the Omicron variant has spread around the world with astonishing speed, even among people who are vaccinated or who had recovered from previous infections. On Thursday the United States surpassed 580,000 cases, beating the record set only a day before. That is believed to be a vast undercount, because of testing shortages, the popularity of at-home tests and reporting delays over the holidays. What’s more, a significant number of people may have asymptomatic infections and never know it. New estimates from researchers at Columbia University suggest that the United States could peak by Jan. 9 at around 2.5 million cases per week, though that number may go as high as 5.4 million. In New York City, the first U.S. metropolis to see a major surge, the researchers estimated that cases would peak by the first week of the new year. “It’s shocking. It’s disturbing,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist who led the Columbia modeling work. “We’re seeing unprecedented numbers of Covid-19 cases.” The variant is significantly milder than Delta and other versions of the virus, and is far less likely to lead to hospitalizations, according to data from South Africa and preliminary data from Britain released on Friday. Still, the enormous numbers of people getting simultaneously infected could greatly strain hospitals, experts said, especially in places with lower vaccination rates or in places where hospitals are already overburdened. Just how much of a burden the variant will be, however, depends on how quickly it will burn out in particular communities, especially in large cities. Those complex transmission dynamics have been maddeningly difficult to predict with precision. Another model, released by a research group from the University of Washington last week, estimated that the United States would reach a peak in cases by the end of January. But even those researchers are now rethinking their projections based on Omicron’s rapid spread. “We are realizing right now monitoring the data that the peak is going to come much faster,” said Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington. “My guess is it will happen before mid-January.” The numbers are increasing so quickly that some epidemiologists say modeling isn’t even necessary to see where things are headed, said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “The context for all of this is that hospitals are struggling,” Dr. Hanage said. “We don’t have that much spare capacity. And of course, Omicron makes that worse.” There are some reasons to think that the variant’s behavior in the United States might be different than in other countries. In South Africa, for example, the population is much younger, and a large proportion had been infected by earlier waves of the virus. In Britain, the vaccination rate for older people is much higher than in the United States. While South Africa saw a rapid increase in cases followed by a sharp decline, it’s unclear whether cases will crest in the United States in a similar fashion. Because of the number of unknowns, including the emergence of new variants and government restrictions aimed at curbing transmission, Shaman’s group limits its projections to four to six weeks in the future. Two things can cause new infections to decline, according to Natalie Dean, an epidemiologist at Emory University. The biggest contributor is that the virus can burn through people in certain communities, especially dense cities; when it stops finding people to infect, new cases decline. People may also change their behaviors, whether through societal restrictions or on their own, giving the virus fewer opportunities to find them. “Our communities are complicated — it doesn’t mean that everyone in the community has gotten infected,” Dr. Dean said. “It’s kind of the people who are most connected.” The United States could also see more localized outbreaks, with cases beginning to decline in current hot spots, like New York City and Washington D.C., just as they’re beginning to take off elsewhere. That could lead to more of a rounded peak instead of a sharp turnaround, Dr. Shaman said. Nearly 600,000 public university students in New York will soon be required to get vaccination booster shots as part of the state’s stepped-up effort to combat a record-breaking coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on Friday. In addition, State University of New York and City University of New York faculty members will now be subject to a vaccination requirement, and a statewide mask mandate that is already in effect will be extended until at least the end of January, Ms. Hochul said at a morning news briefing. The governor unveiled the measures, part of a broader plan labeled “Winter Surge 2.0,” as the fast-spreading Omicron variant continued to push the number of virus cases in the state to new heights with each passing day. On Thursday, the state reported 74,000 new cases of the virus; about 44,000 were in New York City. On Friday, Ms. Hochul announced 76,000 new cases, with the New York City region having the most per capita. The positivity rate for tests was 16 percent statewide, she said. “We are breaking records every day, and we will continue to do so until we hit that downward trend,” the governor said. Hospitalizations linked to the virus have also risen sharply, to almost 8,000 across the state. About half were in New York City. Twenty-one hospitals in the state have suspended elective surgeries as a result of the rise in virus patients. Ms. Hochul called the increase in hospitalizations “very concerning” while speaking at the briefing. “They are putting a lot of stress on an already overtaxed health care system,” she said. To help address the problem, the governor said the state would be releasing more ventilation machines from its stockpile and dispatching additional members of the National Guard to hospitals that are especially overtaxed. The booster requirement for SUNY and CUNY students, which takes effect Jan. 15, reflects Ms. Hochul’s desire to keep the state’s public education system operating with in-person classes at all levels despite the Omicron-driven outbreak. Dozens of colleges and universities in the United States have already taken such a step. New York’s public university students will also be required to show a negative Covid-19 test result when they return to campus, and masks will be mandatory indoors, Ms. Hochul said. As part of her drive to keep schools open and avoid what she has called last year’s “failed experiment” in remote learning, the governor said that more than five million rapid test kits would be provided to school districts serving students from kindergarten to 12th grade. The goal in distributing the kits is to allow for “test-to-stay” policies under which a student takes two rapid tests if a classmate tests positive. If the tests come back negative, the student can remain in school, she said. As for the mask mandate, New York State has had one in place since Dec. 13 for all indoor public places, including offices, building lobbies and stores. Businesses can opt out if they require full vaccination for everyone 12 and older. Children 5 to 11 must have at least one vaccine dose. Ms. Hochul originally said the mask mandate would end on Jan. 15, but on Friday she extended it through the end of January because of the soaring virus case numbers. New York’s fight to contain the virus is also drawing reinforcements from the federal government, which is deploying disaster response units to the state, sending 50 ambulance teams to New York City and dispatching emergency medical teams to SUNY Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse and the Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo, officials said. Most large New Year’s Eve events in the United States have been canceled or diminished, as the nation shattered its record for new daily coronavirus cases on Wednesday. But Chicago, Las Vegas and San Antonio are a few of the anomalies, having neither scrapped nor pared back their plans. In Las Vegas, city officials say that they expect more than 300,000 people on the Strip and downtown for the return — after a one-year hiatus — of New Year’s Eve fireworks. Masks remain required indoors, but face coverings and social distancing are optional outdoors. “We have to get back the best we can to having normal lives,” Mayor Carolyn Goodman said on Wednesday at a news briefing. Clark County, which contains Las Vegas, is averaging about 1,255 new cases a day, more than double the average from two weeks ago, according to a New York Times database. About 53 percent of adults in the county are fully vaccinated. Revelers in San Antonio are also returning to ring in 2022, after last year’s events were canceled in downtown’s Riverwalk because of the pandemic. The event, Celebrate SA, did not suffer from cancellations, despite a steady rise in Covid cases in the city attributed to the Omicron variant. Crowds are expected to descend on La Villita and the area surrounding the Hemisfair park, including the Tower of the Americas, to enjoy live music and a fireworks show. Officials had said they felt outdoor spaces provided fewer opportunities for new infections. Ron Nirenberg, the mayor of San Antonio, urged residents to wear masks in crowded places and get vaccinated as precautionary measures. “When in doubt, mask up, especially in large crowds or when you don’t know the vaccination status of the people you’re with,” Mr. Nirenberg said. Omicron accounted for about 25 percent of all new infections in Texas during the week of Dec. 11, according to the state’s health department. A week later that figure ballooned to about 85 percent. Chicago will have a downtown fireworks display, even as cases in the city have soared to record levels. The fireworks will be launched at eight sites along a 1.5-mile stretch of Lake Michigan and the Chicago River, where several businesses have arranged viewing parties. “Importantly, the display can be viewed outdoors where the spread of Covid-19 is less likely, so our residents and visitors should feel comfortable while masking up and social distancing or even watching safely from home,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement. An indoor mask mandate remains in place in Chicago. Next week, a vaccine mandate will take effect for people wishing to dine indoors or visit gyms."

This Omicron wave is over in the city of Tshwane. It was a flash flood more than a wave.” The rise in deaths over the period was small, and in the last week, officials said, “marginal.” Some scientists were quick to forecast the same pattern elsewhere. “We’ll be in for a tough January, as cases will keep going up and peak, and then fall fast,” said Ali Mokdad, a University of Washington epidemiologist who is a former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientist. While cases will still overwhelm hospitals, he said, he expects that the proportion of hospitalized cases will be lower than in earlier waves. Omicron, bearing dozens of troubling mutations, was first identified in Botswana and South Africa in late November. It rapidly became dominant in South Africa, sending case counts skyrocketing to a pandemic peak averaging more than 23,000 cases a day by mid-December, according to the Our World in Data project at Oxford University. As of last week, Omicron appeared in 95 percent of all new positive test samples that were genetically sequenced. It has spread to more than 100 countries, infecting previously vaccinated and previously infected people, and its proliferation has strained hospitals and thinned work forces in countries like the United States and Britain. In South Africa, overall case counts have been falling for two weeks, plummeting 30 percent in the last week to an average of less than 11,500 a day. Confirmed cases declined in all provinces except Western Cape and Eastern Cape, the data showed, and there was a drop in hospitalizations in all provinces except Western Cape. There are many caveats. The case figures might have been distorted by reduced testing during the holiday season. And many people in the most affected area had some measure of immunity, either from vaccination, prior infection or both, that might have protected them from serious illness. However, research teams in South Africa, Scotland and England have found that Omicron infections more often result in mild illness than earlier variants of the coronavirus, causing fewer hospitalizations. South African officials last week ended tracing efforts and scrapped quarantine for people who were possibly exposed but not experiencing symptoms. “Containment strategies are no longer appropriate — mitigation is the only viable strategy,” the government said then. On Thursday, the government announced an end to its midnight-to-4 a.m. curfew. Still, gatherings are limited to 1,000 people indoors, with appropriate social distancing, and 2,000 people outdoors. Face coverings in public places are mandatory. With more than 580,000 cases, the United States shattered its own record for new daily coronavirus cases — beating a milestone it already broke just the day before. Thursday’s count, according to The New York Times’s database, toppled the 488,000 new cases on Wednesday, which was nearly double the highest numbers from last winter. The back-to-back record-breaking days are a growing sign of the virus’s fast spread and come as the world enters its third year of the pandemic. Hospitalizations and deaths, however, have not followed the same dramatic increase, further indication that the Omicron variant seems to be milder than Delta and causes fewer cases of severe illness. In the past two weeks, deaths are down by five percent, with a daily average of 1,221, while hospitalizations increased by just 15 percent to an average of 78,781 per day.  Across the country, airlines canceled thousands of flights, leaving would-be travelers stranded, while others waited in line for hours to get their hands on a coronavirus test.  The high numbers are even more striking considering that experts associate the holiday season with major disturbances in testing and data reporting. The rise of at-home tests could also mean some cases aren’t making into the official count.  Last year, the so-called holiday curve showed a major decline in cases after Thanksgiving and Christmas, which underreported the spike in cases that actually took place. It’s likely that this season many more people have the virus than what’s being accounted for; just how many may not be clear for another few weeks.  The worldwide surge is being propelled by the new variant, Omicron. And while it is more infectious, research shows that cases with the variant are milder. Vaccinations are already proven to reduce the severity of the virus.  The majority of Americans, 62 percent, are fully vaccinated, according to The New York Times’s database. Nearly three-quarters of people have received at least one dose. And 68.8 million of those fully vaccinated have also received a third dose, or booster shot, since Aug. 13, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday raised its Covid-19 warning level for cruise ships to 4, the highest, and issued a blunt warning: “Avoid cruise travel regardless of vaccination status.” The move came as the number of outbreaks on ships has grown in recent weeks, causing some ports to turn away ships. Last week, dozens of people on a Royal Caribbean International ship tested positive after it set sail from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and a Carnival Cruise Line ship returned to Miami on Sunday after positive tests among “a small number on board.” Calling the C.D.C.’s decision “perplexing,” the cruise industry’s trade group, Cruise Lines International Association, said in a statement that the number of cases onboard made up a very slim minority of the total population and that “the majority of cases were asymptomatic or mild in nature, posing little to no burden on medical resources onboard or onshore.” Before the C.D.C.’s warning on Thursday, Royal Caribbean Group, one of the biggest cruise companies, said its ships had carried 1.1 million guests since it had restarted U.S. operations in June, with 1,745 people testing positive. While the majority of passengers had mild or no symptoms, 41 people were hospitalized. “Omicron is having a big short-term impact on everyone, but many observers see this as a major step towards Covid-19 becoming endemic rather than epidemic,” said Richard D. Fain, chairman and chief executive of Royal Caribbean Cruises. Despite the increase in cruise ship cases, Mexico’s government announced this week that it would let cruise ships dock at its ports even if passengers have tested positive for the coronavirus, and also allow asymptomatic travelers to disembark on its shores. The announcement came after two cruise ships with Covid outbreaks were refused permission by the authorities in Jalisco State in the last week to let passengers or crew disembark at Puerto Vallarta, a popular tourist destination on Mexico’s Pacific coast. “Our country maintains its policy of solidarity and fraternity, as well as the principle of non-discrimination towards all people,” the government said in a statement. “The health and tourism authorities remain attentive to provide the necessary medical assistance to those who visit us.” The coronavirus wreaked havoc on the cruise industry in the early stages of the pandemic, infecting hundreds of cruise passengers and workers and requiring the sector to shut down for 18 months. To begin sailing, cruise ships had to agree to the C.D.C.’s Conditional Sailing Order, which is valid until Jan. 15. On most cruises out of U.S. ports, almost all crew members and adult passengers are vaccinated and masks are required indoors except for when passengers are eating or drinking.  Among the safety measures the order requires — beyond submitting the daily number of coronavirus cases — is a prevention and control plan for each cruise ship.  Most cruise companies do not publicly announce the number of coronavirus cases identified during sailings, but all cruise ships operating to and from U.S. ports must submit daily numbers to the C.D.C., which uses a color-coded system to inform the public whether the number of cases is above or below the agency’s threshold for an investigation. Currently 88 cruise ships are being monitored by the C.D.C. because of reported coronavirus cases onboard. The agency does not publicly specify the number of cases on each ship. Some Covid infected, asymptomatic sailors from a ship docked at Guantánamo Bay with a coronavirus outbreak were removed from the ship and its environs before Christmas and put in quarantine in a base hotel, the Navy said Thursday. The Navy had previously reported that all the sailors had remained aboard the ship.  The U.S.S. Milwaukee arrived at Guantánamo Bay on Dec. 20 with a fully vaccinated crew of 105 sailors and Coast Guard members, some sick with the virus. It has been docked there since, as officials grapple with an outbreak among 25 percent of the crew.  None required hospitalization or medical evacuation from the remote base in southeast Cuba, Guantánamo health officials said, and those who did become sick experienced symptoms that were “mild in nature,” according to Cmdr. Kate Meadows, a spokeswoman for the Fourth Fleet in Jacksonville. Commander Meadows had earlier said that none of the sailors had left the ship or its immediate pier area since arriving at Guantánamo. Instead, she said crew members celebrated Christmas on the ship or in fresh air at the pier, segregated from the base, which has a mixed civilian and military population of about 6,000 residents, of whom about 900 are unvaccinated.  On Thursday, she clarified that some sailors who tested positive but were asymptomatic were moved to a hotel in the center of the base “due to limited berthing.”  She declined to say how many were moved but a Navy official, who was not authorized to be identified by name, elaborated that five sailors were moved ashore, so that the ship could strictly segregate the infected members on board from those who were Covid free. The sailors brought ashore were checked in “remotely” to a Navy run hotel, had no contact with staff and were placed in rooms with orange signs signifying the occupants were under quarantine, said the base spokeswoman, Nikki Maxwell. Navy health officials had yet to establish which variant of the virus had infected the sailors. “The sailors remaining with symptoms continue to only be mild in nature, again showing the importance of the vaccine and aggressive cleaning measures onboard,” Commander Meadows said. The U.S.S. Milwaukee departed its home port in Jacksonville, Fla., on Dec. 15 to undertake an anti-drug-trafficking mission under the direction of the U.S. Southern Command. The ship is expected to return to the mission in the new year. Airlines have been preparing for the holiday season for months, reviewing plans and readying reserves of workers. But that wasn’t enough to mitigate the effects of the fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus and of heavy snow and strong winds in the West. The impact continued to be felt on Thursday, with more than 1,200 cancellations of flights to, from or within the United States by afternoon, according to the air travel data site FlightAware. The site also showed more than 640 cancellations for Friday. The continued disruption comes as the country is averaging more than 260,000 new coronavirus cases a day, greater than the peak levels from last winter. Infection rates are especially high in parts of the Northeast and Midwest. Caseloads have continued to increase rapidly as the Omicron variant spreads, though deaths and hospitalizations have remained relatively steady.  The surge has disrupted far more than air travel. New York City has slowed to a crawl as the virus thins the ranks of subway workers and emergency personnel. Cincinnati declared a state of emergency on Wednesday to help the city deal with labor shortages within the city’s Fire Department amid a spike in coronavirus cases that coincided with scheduled holiday vacations. Many cities have canceled or limited New Year’s celebrations. More broadly, the pandemic has caused months of havoc in supply chains.  The air carriers hit hard on Thursday included JetBlue, with 17 percent of its total flights canceled. JetBlue said Wednesday that it was reducing its schedule through Jan. 13. In a statement, the airline said it had “seen a surge” in sick calls because of the Omicron variant, hampering its ability to staff its flights suitably even though it started the holidays with more workers than at any point since the pandemic began. “We expect the number of Covid cases in the Northeast — where most of our crew members are based — to continue to surge for the next week or two,” the company said. “This means there is a high likelihood of additional cancellations until case counts start to come down.” Alaska Airlines, whose primary hub is Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, canceled 14 percent of its flights. Relentless snowfall and record low temperatures in the Pacific Northwest grounded planes last week, and it snowed again in Seattle on Thursday. Looking to relieve its staffing squeeze, the airline industry pushed for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to shorten its recommended isolation period for Americans infected with Covid-19. The agency had previously recommended that infected patients isolate for 10 days after a positive test. But on Monday, it reduced that period to five days for those without symptoms and those without fevers whose other symptoms were resolving. Delta Air Lines was one of the first companies to adapt to the updated guidance. Its new policy, dated Tuesday, provides five days of paid leave for vaccinated workers who test positive for the coronavirus to isolate, according to an internal communication to company leaders obtained by The New York Times. The policy encourages, but does not require, a Covid test to go back to work — going a step further than the C.D.C. guidance, which does not include a recommendation for additional testing — and Delta is offering two additional days of paid time off for workers who test positive on Day 5. But the airline’s protocols make no mention of whether returning employees should have improving symptoms, as suggested by the C.D.C. Megabus, a long-distance bus operator, said Thursday that it is offering free rides on routes in the U.S. and Canada to travelers whose flights are canceled between Dec. 27 and Jan. 7.  Michigan health officials announced Thursday that the state will ignore new isolation guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pending “additional information.”  On Monday, the C.D.C. cut in half the recommended isolation period of 10 days for those with little or no symptoms. Those now leaving isolation should quarantine for five days and wear masks for an additional five days, federal health officials said.  In its statement, Michigan’s health department said it wanted to review the evidence behind the new isolation guidelines, including its application for high-risk groups, before it adopted the protocol.  Until then, the state “will retain current quarantine and isolation guidelines,” and have its residents follow the previous 10-day isolation period.  Health officials also expressed concern over a recent spike in cases across the state, thought to be the result of the new, and highly transmissible, Omicron variant. More than 9,000 people are testing positive every day in Michigan, a 40 percent jump over the last two weeks.  The new guidelines have divided health and government officials, who disagreed on whether or not they were necessary.  “The C.D.C. made a decision to balance what’s good for public health at the same time as keeping the society running,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said on News Nation’s “Morning in America” on Thursday.  Still, Dr. Fauci added, the new guidelines are not “100 percent risk-free.”  Others disagreed. The New York State Nurses Association issued its own statement on Dec. 24 in response to the new guidelines, calling the emergency guidance “potentially dangerous for health care workers and the communities we serve.”  “This guidance is inconsistent with proven science, vague, and doesn’t provide definitions or explain standards at a time when decision-making for health care systems is critical,” the organization said.  The Food and Drug Administration is planning to broaden eligibility for coronavirus vaccine booster doses on Monday, allowing 12- to 15-year-olds to receive third doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine, according to people familiar with the agency’s deliberations.  Regulators also plan to allow both adolescents and adults to seek an extra shot of Pfizer’s vaccine five months after receiving a second dose instead of the current period of six months. A booster shot is also expected to be authorized for younger children, ages 5 to 11, with immune deficiencies.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee is planning to meet by the middle of next week to vote on whether to recommend the changes. If the committee agrees with the F.D.A.’s authorizations, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, is expected to promptly endorse the revisions. The move to expand boosters comes as the highly contagious Omicron variant is infecting a record number of Americans with the coronavirus, putting more pressure on hospitals already deluged by Covid-19 patients from the Delta variant. More than 70 percent of people in the United States 12 years and older are fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C. At least 1.8 million adolescents between 12 and 15 years old have tested positive for the virus, according to the C.D.C. Children can better withstand coronavirus infections, but in rare instances still can get very sick and even die.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released two studies on Thursday that underscored the importance of vaccinating children against the coronavirus. One study found that serious problems among children 5 to 11 who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were extremely rare. The other, which looked at hundreds of pediatric hospitalizations in six cities last summer, found that nearly all of the children who became seriously ill had not been fully vaccinated. More than eight million doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been given to children 5 to 11 in the United States so far. But concerns about the unknowns of a new vaccine caused some parents to hesitate in allowing their children to be inoculated, including those who said they preferred to wait for the broader rollout to bring any rare problems to the surface. By Dec. 19, roughly six weeks into the campaign to vaccinate 5- to 11-year-olds, the C.D.C. said that it had received very few reports of serious problems. The agency evaluated reports received from doctors and members of the public, as well as survey responses from the parents or guardians of roughly 43,000 children in that age group. Many of the surveyed children reported pain at the site of the shot, fatigue, or a headache, especially after the second dose. Roughly 13 percent of those surveyed reported a fever after the second shot. But reports of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle that has been linked in rare cases to coronavirus vaccines, remained scarce. The C.D.C. said there were 11 verified reports that had come in from doctors, vaccine manufacturers or other members of the public. Of those, seven children had recovered and four were recovering at the time of the report, the C.D.C. said. The C.D.C. said that reporting rates for vaccine-related myocarditis appeared highest among boys and men aged 12 to 29. A number of parents or doctors also reported instances of 5- to 11-year-olds receiving the incorrect, larger vaccine dose meant for older children and adults. The C.D.C. said that those problems were “not unexpected,” and that most such reports mentioned that the children experienced no problems afterward. The C.D.C. detailed two reports of deaths, in girls ages 5 and 6, who the agency said had chronic medical conditions and were in “fragile health” before their shots. “On initial review, no data were found that would suggest a causal association between death and vaccination,” the agency said. The C.D.C.’s separate report on pediatric hospitalizations provided additional evidence about the importance of vaccinating all eligible children. The study, which looked at more than 700 children under 18 who were admitted to hospitals with Covid-19 last summer, found that 0.4 percent of those children who were eligible for the shots had been fully vaccinated. The study also found that two-thirds of all the hospitalized children had a comorbidity, most often obesity, and that about one-third of children 5 and older were sick with more than one viral infection. Overall, nearly one-third of the children were so sick they had to be treated in intensive care units, and almost 15 percent needed medical ventilation. Among all those hospitalized, 1.5 percent of the children died, the study found. The six hospitals were in Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Texas and Washington, D.C. “This study demonstrates that unvaccinated children hospitalized for Covid-19 could experience severe disease and reinforces the importance of vaccination of all eligible children to provide individual protection and to protect those who are not yet eligible to be vaccinated,” the authors of the study wrote. Crowds at home games for professional sports teams in Ontario, Canada, including the Toronto Raptors and the Maple Leafs, will be pared to 1,000 spectators or fewer under public health measures announced Thursday by the province’s authorities as the Omicron variant continues to fuel a rise in coronavirus infections. Sporting events, concerts and theaters will be limited to either 1,000 attendees or 50 percent of their usual capacity, whichever was fewer. The restrictions will take effect Friday and apply to the Maple Leafs and Ottawa Senators of the N.H.L., the Raptors of the N.B.A., and lower-level teams. Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, the parent company of the Toronto teams, said in a statement Thursday that it would “transition to operating without sold tickets,” starting Friday. The company expected the attendance cap would be in place for at least three weeks, at which point the province would reassess the situation. The Raptors will not be selling tickets to the general public, but “will honor our commitments under N.B.A. rule — so essentially family, friends, opposing team tickets,” Jennifer Quinn, the director of communications for the Raptors, said in an email. The N.H.L. last week decided to begin its scheduled holiday break early as the virus spread within its teams. After one game on Dec. 21, play didn’t resume until Tuesday. Even after its return, the league on Tuesday postponed a game because of virus issues, and postponed another nine games involving Canadian teams affected by attendance regulations, hoping they could host larger contingents of fans at a later date. Quinn said the Raptors and the N.B.A. had not discussed postponing games because of the capacity restrictions. The Raptors have six home games within the next three weeks. The N.B.A. has postponed 11 games this season, including three Raptors games, when at least one competing team did not have enough available players in part because of virus outbreaks. Ontario’s latest protocols further reduced capacity after earlier this month it cut the figure to 50 percent, or about 10,000 spectators, for the Maple Leafs, Senators and Raptors. Ontario is averaging nearly 10,000 cases per day, up 515 percent from two weeks ago. As the Omicron variant sweeps across the planet, the global tally of new coronavirus cases has for the first time passed one million per day on average. The previous global case record set last April has already been broken three times this week. The United States, Canada and much of Western Europe are leading the surge, with both regions seeing record-breaking levels of new coronavirus cases. The daily average number of new cases in the United States on Tuesday was more than 267,000, exceeding the previous all-time peak set in January; Wednesday’s average was higher still, at more than 300,000. New cases in at least 11 European countries — Britain, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Spain and Switzerland — also passed their previous all-time peaks on Tuesday or Wednesday. In France, the daily case average passed 100,000. Cases in Canada have also seen a steep increase in recent days, more than doubling in a week to an average of more than 25,000. And Australia’s cases climbed to an average of more than 12,600 on Wednesday — eight times higher than just three weeks earlier. Britain’s National Health Service “is now on a war footing,” one of its top medical officials warned on Thursday, saying its hospitals would erect field wards to help deal with the surge in coronavirus cases that has produced a steep rise in hospitalizations nationally. Health experts were bracing for more challenges in the coming weeks that would further strain the system, which is besieged by the absences of tens of thousands of health care workers who are sick themselves, or isolating. Officials also cautioned that absences could have a far-reaching impact on public services like transportation. Coronavirus cases in Britain reached new highs this week, driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant, with 183,037 cases reported across the country on Wednesday — twice the highest daily count recorded in previous waves. More than 10,000 people with the coronavirus were hospitalized in England on Wednesday, the highest number since March, though it is still unclear how many were hospitalized for illness caused by the virus and how many were there for another reason but also tested positive. On Thursday, the National Health Service outlined plans for new field hospitals in England in response to the wave of Omicron cases. These temporary facilities, called “Nightingale hubs,” will be capable of housing around 100 patients each, the health service said in a statement, and would be set up at eight hospitals across the country. “We do not yet know exactly how many of those who catch the virus will need hospital treatment,” Stephen Powis, the medical director of Britain’s National Health Service, said in a statement. “But given the number of infections we cannot wait to find out before we act and so work is beginning from today to ensure these facilities are in place.” JERUSALEM — Israel on Thursday approved a fourth dose of Covid vaccine for people with weakened immune systems, moving ahead of much of the world in taking a little-studied step to try to protect its most vulnerable against the fast-spreading Omicron variant. The decision by health officials came more than a week after an advisory panel of Israeli experts recommended a fourth dose for people with weak immune systems, as well as for others at high risk, including those aged 60 and over and health workers.  The panel had acknowledged the uncertainties and lack of data surrounding both Omicron and the fourth dose, but presented data indicating a significant waning of immunity in people aged 60 or older, who were the first to receive their third shots starting in August. At a news conference on Thursday evening, Prof. Nachman Ash, the director-general of Israel’s Ministry of Health, said the advisory panel’s recommendation had been partially accepted, and a fourth dose would be offered to those whose immune systems have been compromised by illness or treatments they are undergoing. “Given the gaps of knowledge that exist around the world regarding the efficiency of a fourth dose in the current circumstances, we are acting cautiously and responsibly,” Professor Ash said. He said Israeli health officials would continue to monitor the effects of Omicron in Israel and abroad, including the risk of severe illness in people who are already vaccinated, before taking any decision to broaden the rollout of a fourth dose for other vulnerable people, including the older population. Weighing the potential benefits of another booster shot against the risks, some scientists, including a few on the Israeli advisory panel, have voiced concern that too many vaccinations might cause a sort of immune system fatigue, compromising the body’s ability to fight the coronavirus, particularly among older people. The Sheba Medical Center, near Tel Aviv, began a study on Monday to test the safety and effectiveness of a fourth dose of a vaccine, administering an additional shot to 150 medical personnel who had received a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least four months ago. After Thursday’s announcement, officials there said the hospital would start administering fourth doses to heart transplant patients on Friday morning.  Developments in Israel, an early leader in Covid vaccinations, are being closely watched as governments worldwide struggle to confront the rapidly spreading Omicron variant, which is driving record numbers of new infections in parts of the United States, Europe and many other places. Israel was the first country to roll out third shots as boosters for the population at large, putting it in position to assess earlier than other countries how effective the shots are and how quickly the protection might wear off. Even as some studies suggest that Omicron infections are milder than those caused by other variants, the surges are already stretching health systems. Israel’s hospitals have already filled up with patients suffering from complications of winter flu and other respiratory ailments.  At least half the new daily cases in Israel are now believed to be from Omicron, and experts say that variant is likely to surpass Delta as the dominant variant in the country within a couple of weeks. Over four million Israelis have received a booster shot, out of a total population of nine million, but about a million eligible Israelis have not. In November, Israel became one of the first countries after the United States to approve Covid vaccinations for children aged 5 to 11, but the initial uptake in that age group has been slow. On Thursday, Israel received its first shipment of Pfizer’s coronavirus drug. Known as Paxlovid, it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week for Covid patients age 12 and over who are vulnerable to becoming severely ill because of their age or prior medical conditions. Crowds will return to Times Square on Friday for the annual ball drop, despite the surge in Covid-19 cases in New York City and across the country, but one notable act will not be there: the rapper LL Cool J, who announced he had tested positive for Covid on Wednesday. The singer Chloe Bailey also canceled on Wednesday, although she did not explain why. Several other musical acts are slated to perform, including KT Tunstall, Karol G and Journey.  Mayor Bill de Blasio announced last week that although New Year’s Eve celebrations would be scaled back somewhat this year, the ball drop would go on. Last year, only a small number of frontline workers and their families were allowed to attend. Although the public will be welcome once more to Times Square, revelers may want to think twice about watching the ball drop in person this year. New York City’s seven-day average test positivity rate was about 15 percent on Tuesday, according to the state. The event will also draw people from places around the country and the world with varying rates of Covid cases and vaccination. The celebrations will kick off at 6 p.m. in Times Square. Visitors won’t be allowed into the viewing areas until 3 p.m., hours later than in past years. Millions of rapid at-home Covid tests are flying off pharmacy shelves across the United States, giving Americans an instant, if sometimes imperfect, read on whether they are infected with the coronavirus. But the results are rarely reported to public health departments, exacerbating the longstanding challenges of maintaining an accurate count of cases at a time when the number of infections is surging because of the Omicron variant. At the minimum, the widespread availability of at-home tests is wreaking havoc with the accuracy of official positivity rates and case counts. At the other extreme, it is one factor making some public health experts raise a question that once would have been unthinkable: Do counts of coronavirus cases serve a useful purpose, and if not, should they be continued? “Our entire approach to the pandemic has been case-based surveillance: We have to count every case, and that’s just not accurate anymore,” said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, a national nonprofit organization representing public health agencies in the United States. “It’s just becoming a time where we’ve got to think about doing things differently.” British scientists announced on Thursday that a new study will find out if increasing the dosage of a cheap and readily available steroid can help patients with extremely severe cases of Covid-19. Dexamethasone became an unexpected sign of hope early on in the pandemic when scientists discovered that its use could save the lives of severely ill coronavirus patients. By reducing inflammation caused by the virus, and therefore stopping an immune reaction that could kill those infected, one estimate found that, had Britain implemented it earlier, 5,000 more people would still be alive. In a trial, scheduled to take place in the next few months, those with low oxygen levels will be administered the higher dosage. Instead of the standard six milligrams patients began receiving in June 2020, those in the new trial will receive more than double that: 20 milligrams for the first five days, followed by 10 for the remainder of the treatment. Scientists hope the higher quantity will reduce hospital stays, avoid the use of ventilators and prevent deaths. The same researchers who discovered the drug’s initial effectiveness are launching this new study, which will begin in a few months, because of an anticipated spike in hospitalizations, following a surge of coronavirus cases. Both the United States and a handful of European nations are shattering daily case records brought on largely by the highly contagious variant. Within weeks of its discovery in the U.S., more than 59 percent of new coronavirus cases in the country are now linked to Omicron. “Given how quickly the Omicron variant is spreading, we can expect to see patients admitted to hospital with severe Covid-19 for a while to come,” Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the University of Oxford, said in a statement. “This makes it very important that we continue to explore ways to further improve the care of patients with severe Covid-19.” Citigroup has expanded remote working for its U.S. employees as a surge in coronavirus cases disrupts Wall Street’s return-to-office plans. Again.“We are asking that you work from home for the first few weeks of the new year if you are able to do so,” Citigroup said in a memo to staff on Thursday. “We will continue to monitor the data and provide an update in January on when we expect to be back in the office.” Citigroup’s new guidance applies to employees in more than 30 offices around the country who had been called back since September. Employees in New York City and New Jersey were already given the option to work from home in the final weeks of the year.JPMorgan Chase gave employees more flexibility to work from home in the first two weeks of January, but expects them to return to in-office schedules no later than Feb. 1, according to a memo to employees.“We are not changing our long-term plans of working in the office,” the bank’s operating committee said in the memo. The company may also amend its policy on vaccinations, which it has not required so far.“Government-issued vaccine mandates may likely make it difficult or impossible for us to continue to employ unvaccinated employees, so getting the vaccine is very important,” the memo said. The bank may soon require a booster shot for people entering its buildings. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has prompted big Wall Street companies, which have been eager to bring workers back, to press pause on those plans. Wells Fargo postponed its return to the office, while corporate employees at Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank were given more leeway to work remotely over the holidays. Goldman Sachs has bucked the trend. The investment bank, which called most workers back to the office in June, will require a booster for all employees eligible to receive one beginning Feb. 1, and it will require staff to be tested for the virus twice a week at on-site testing centers starting Jan. 10. Currently, employees in the office must get tested once a week. CHICAGO — Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois urged hospitals on Thursday to postpone nonemergency surgeries as the state seeks to preserve bed availability in the face of record numbers of new cases. “We’re asking our residents to temporarily hold off on important medical care like tonsillectomies, bariatric surgeries and hernia repair,” Mr. Pritzker, a Democrat, said in a statement, adding that he expected the case surge to continue into the new year.  Like in much of the country, cases in Illinois are spiking as the highly infectious Omicron variant takes hold. The state is averaging more than 16,000 new cases a day, compared to about 4,400 daily at the start of December. Around 4,600 Illinoisans with the virus are hospitalized, up 35 percent over the last two weeks but still well below the peak levels seen last winter. Early data suggests that Omicron causes milder illness than previous forms of the virus. Though businesses remain open, the virus has encroached on daily life in Illinois in increasingly obvious ways. Chicago residents are lining up on chilly sidewalks outside storefront testing centers. Several colleges have announced that they will begin the new academic term with online classes. Driver’s license offices will close next week because of rising infection levels. And earlier Thursday, the state’s lieutenant governor, Juliana Stratton, said that she had tested positive. Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the state’s public health director, warned in a statement about health care worker shortages and growing fatigue among doctors and nurses. Case rates are especially high around Champaign, Chicago and Peoria. “We are currently seeing approximately 500 new admissions a day to Illinois hospitals due to Covid-19, and approximately 90 percent of those are unvaccinated,” Dr. Ezike said, adding that “we’re seeing health care workers leave the profession because they are burned out after watching people suffer severe illness and even death for almost two years now.” Unlike the rest of the Midwest, Illinois continues to have a statewide mask mandate. And starting Monday, people in Chicago hoping to eat indoors or go to gyms will have to prove that they are vaccinated.  Still, much of daily life continues even as the virus data worsens. Chicago Public Schools students are scheduled to return to class on Monday. And a New Year’s Eve fireworks display along the Chicago waterfront is expected to go ahead, with watch parties planned at several downtown businesses.

Over the past year, working from anonymous DNA samples, Moore helped identify the suspect in a murder by tracking old migration patterns from Poland to northern New Jersey; solved an assault case in which female DNA at the crime scene turned out to have been left not by the usual sort of explicable coincidence but by an actual female perpetrator; and made a key discovery in a murder investigation when the gravestone of an apparently childless woman was found to bear the inscription “MOTHER.” Some of these she knocked out in a few frenzied days. But there was also one cold case that had dogged her for close to two and a half years: the murder, in Gresham, Ore., of a woman named Barbara Tucker.  Moore is perhaps the most prominent figure in the field of genetic genealogy — the mapping and measuring of how relatives share DNA — which was developed in the aughts as a result of direct-to-consumer genomic testing. One application of genetic genealogy, it quickly became clear, was to determine someone’s identity through a broader web of genetic relationships, and Moore rose to prominence solving maternity-ward mix-ups, helping adoptees and foundlings locate birth parents and identifying unknown fathers. Starting with relatives in DNA databases and working through public records and social media, you could narrow in on the right branch of the right family tree, triangulating the mystery person; in other words, you could use the haystack to find the needle."

This Omicron wave is over in the city of Tshwane. It was a flash flood more than a wave.” The rise in deaths over the period was small, and in the last week, officials said, “marginal.” Some scientists were quick to forecast the same pattern elsewhere. “We’ll be in for a tough January, as cases will keep going up and peak, and then fall fast,” said Ali Mokdad, a University of Washington epidemiologist who is a former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientist. While cases will still overwhelm hospitals, he said, he expects that the proportion of hospitalized cases will be lower than in earlier waves. Omicron, bearing dozens of troubling mutations, was first identified in Botswana and South Africa in late November. It rapidly became dominant in South Africa, sending case counts skyrocketing to a pandemic peak averaging more than 23,000 cases a day by mid-December, according to the Our World in Data project at Oxford University. As of last week, Omicron appeared in 95 percent of all new positive test samples that were genetically sequenced. It has spread to more than 100 countries, infecting previously vaccinated and previously infected people, and its proliferation has strained hospitals and thinned work forces in countries like the United States and Britain. In South Africa, overall case counts have been falling for two weeks, plummeting 30 percent in the last week to an average of less than 11,500 a day. Confirmed cases declined in all provinces except Western Cape and Eastern Cape, the data showed, and there was a drop in hospitalizations in all provinces except Western Cape. There are many caveats. The case figures might have been distorted by reduced testing during the holiday season. And many people in the most affected area had some measure of immunity, either from vaccination, prior infection or both, that might have protected them from serious illness. However, research teams in South Africa, Scotland and England have found that Omicron infections more often result in mild illness than earlier variants of the coronavirus, causing fewer hospitalizations. South African officials last week ended tracing efforts and scrapped quarantine for people who were possibly exposed but not experiencing symptoms. “Containment strategies are no longer appropriate — mitigation is the only viable strategy,” the government said then. On Thursday, the government announced an end to its midnight-to-4 a.m. curfew. Still, gatherings are limited to 1,000 people indoors, with appropriate social distancing, and 2,000 people outdoors. Face coverings in public places are mandatory. With more than 580,000 cases, the United States shattered its own record for new daily coronavirus cases — beating a milestone it already broke just the day before. Thursday’s count, according to The New York Times’s database, toppled the 488,000 new cases on Wednesday, which was nearly double the highest numbers from last winter. The back-to-back record-breaking days are a growing sign of the virus’s fast spread and come as the world enters its third year of the pandemic. Hospitalizations and deaths, however, have not followed the same dramatic increase, further indication that the Omicron variant seems to be milder than Delta and causes fewer cases of severe illness. In the past two weeks, deaths are down by five percent, with a daily average of 1,221, while hospitalizations increased by just 15 percent to an average of 78,781 per day.  Across the country, airlines canceled thousands of flights, leaving would-be travelers stranded, while others waited in line for hours to get their hands on a coronavirus test.  The high numbers are even more striking considering that experts associate the holiday season with major disturbances in testing and data reporting. The rise of at-home tests could also mean some cases aren’t making into the official count.  Last year, the so-called holiday curve showed a major decline in cases after Thanksgiving and Christmas, which underreported the spike in cases that actually took place. It’s likely that this season many more people have the virus than what’s being accounted for; just how many may not be clear for another few weeks.  The worldwide surge is being propelled by the new variant, Omicron. And while it is more infectious, research shows that cases with the variant are milder. Vaccinations are already proven to reduce the severity of the virus.  The majority of Americans, 62 percent, are fully vaccinated, according to The New York Times’s database. Nearly three-quarters of people have received at least one dose. And 68.8 million of those fully vaccinated have also received a third dose, or booster shot, since Aug. 13, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday raised its Covid-19 warning level for cruise ships to 4, the highest, and issued a blunt warning: “Avoid cruise travel regardless of vaccination status.” The move came as the number of outbreaks on ships has grown in recent weeks, causing some ports to turn away ships. Last week, dozens of people on a Royal Caribbean International ship tested positive after it set sail from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and a Carnival Cruise Line ship returned to Miami on Sunday after positive tests among “a small number on board.” Calling the C.D.C.’s decision “perplexing,” the cruise industry’s trade group, Cruise Lines International Association, said in a statement that the number of cases onboard made up a very slim minority of the total population and that “the majority of cases were asymptomatic or mild in nature, posing little to no burden on medical resources onboard or onshore.” Before the C.D.C.’s warning on Thursday, Royal Caribbean Group, one of the biggest cruise companies, said its ships had carried 1.1 million guests since it had restarted U.S. operations in June, with 1,745 people testing positive. While the majority of passengers had mild or no symptoms, 41 people were hospitalized. “Omicron is having a big short-term impact on everyone, but many observers see this as a major step towards Covid-19 becoming endemic rather than epidemic,” said Richard D. Fain, chairman and chief executive of Royal Caribbean Cruises. Despite the increase in cruise ship cases, Mexico’s government announced this week that it would let cruise ships dock at its ports even if passengers have tested positive for the coronavirus, and also allow asymptomatic travelers to disembark on its shores. The announcement came after two cruise ships with Covid outbreaks were refused permission by the authorities in Jalisco State in the last week to let passengers or crew disembark at Puerto Vallarta, a popular tourist destination on Mexico’s Pacific coast. “Our country maintains its policy of solidarity and fraternity, as well as the principle of non-discrimination towards all people,” the government said in a statement. “The health and tourism authorities remain attentive to provide the necessary medical assistance to those who visit us.” The coronavirus wreaked havoc on the cruise industry in the early stages of the pandemic, infecting hundreds of cruise passengers and workers and requiring the sector to shut down for 18 months. To begin sailing, cruise ships had to agree to the C.D.C.’s Conditional Sailing Order, which is valid until Jan. 15. On most cruises out of U.S. ports, almost all crew members and adult passengers are vaccinated and masks are required indoors except for when passengers are eating or drinking.  Among the safety measures the order requires — beyond submitting the daily number of coronavirus cases — is a prevention and control plan for each cruise ship.  Most cruise companies do not publicly announce the number of coronavirus cases identified during sailings, but all cruise ships operating to and from U.S. ports must submit daily numbers to the C.D.C., which uses a color-coded system to inform the public whether the number of cases is above or below the agency’s threshold for an investigation. Currently 88 cruise ships are being monitored by the C.D.C. because of reported coronavirus cases onboard. The agency does not publicly specify the number of cases on each ship. Some Covid infected, asymptomatic sailors from a ship docked at Guantánamo Bay with a coronavirus outbreak were removed from the ship and its environs before Christmas and put in quarantine in a base hotel, the Navy said Thursday. The Navy had previously reported that all the sailors had remained aboard the ship.  The U.S.S. Milwaukee arrived at Guantánamo Bay on Dec. 20 with a fully vaccinated crew of 105 sailors and Coast Guard members, some sick with the virus. It has been docked there since, as officials grapple with an outbreak among 25 percent of the crew.  None required hospitalization or medical evacuation from the remote base in southeast Cuba, Guantánamo health officials said, and those who did become sick experienced symptoms that were “mild in nature,” according to Cmdr. Kate Meadows, a spokeswoman for the Fourth Fleet in Jacksonville. Commander Meadows had earlier said that none of the sailors had left the ship or its immediate pier area since arriving at Guantánamo. Instead, she said crew members celebrated Christmas on the ship or in fresh air at the pier, segregated from the base, which has a mixed civilian and military population of about 6,000 residents, of whom about 900 are unvaccinated.  On Thursday, she clarified that some sailors who tested positive but were asymptomatic were moved to a hotel in the center of the base “due to limited berthing.”  She declined to say how many were moved but a Navy official, who was not authorized to be identified by name, elaborated that five sailors were moved ashore, so that the ship could strictly segregate the infected members on board from those who were Covid free. The sailors brought ashore were checked in “remotely” to a Navy run hotel, had no contact with staff and were placed in rooms with orange signs signifying the occupants were under quarantine, said the base spokeswoman, Nikki Maxwell. Navy health officials had yet to establish which variant of the virus had infected the sailors. “The sailors remaining with symptoms continue to only be mild in nature, again showing the importance of the vaccine and aggressive cleaning measures onboard,” Commander Meadows said. The U.S.S. Milwaukee departed its home port in Jacksonville, Fla., on Dec. 15 to undertake an anti-drug-trafficking mission under the direction of the U.S. Southern Command. The ship is expected to return to the mission in the new year. Airlines have been preparing for the holiday season for months, reviewing plans and readying reserves of workers. But that wasn’t enough to mitigate the effects of the fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus and of heavy snow and strong winds in the West. The impact continued to be felt on Thursday, with more than 1,200 cancellations of flights to, from or within the United States by afternoon, according to the air travel data site FlightAware. The site also showed more than 640 cancellations for Friday. The continued disruption comes as the country is averaging more than 260,000 new coronavirus cases a day, greater than the peak levels from last winter. Infection rates are especially high in parts of the Northeast and Midwest. Caseloads have continued to increase rapidly as the Omicron variant spreads, though deaths and hospitalizations have remained relatively steady.  The surge has disrupted far more than air travel. New York City has slowed to a crawl as the virus thins the ranks of subway workers and emergency personnel. Cincinnati declared a state of emergency on Wednesday to help the city deal with labor shortages within the city’s Fire Department amid a spike in coronavirus cases that coincided with scheduled holiday vacations. Many cities have canceled or limited New Year’s celebrations. More broadly, the pandemic has caused months of havoc in supply chains.  The air carriers hit hard on Thursday included JetBlue, with 17 percent of its total flights canceled. JetBlue said Wednesday that it was reducing its schedule through Jan. 13. In a statement, the airline said it had “seen a surge” in sick calls because of the Omicron variant, hampering its ability to staff its flights suitably even though it started the holidays with more workers than at any point since the pandemic began. “We expect the number of Covid cases in the Northeast — where most of our crew members are based — to continue to surge for the next week or two,” the company said. “This means there is a high likelihood of additional cancellations until case counts start to come down.” Alaska Airlines, whose primary hub is Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, canceled 14 percent of its flights. Relentless snowfall and record low temperatures in the Pacific Northwest grounded planes last week, and it snowed again in Seattle on Thursday. Looking to relieve its staffing squeeze, the airline industry pushed for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to shorten its recommended isolation period for Americans infected with Covid-19. The agency had previously recommended that infected patients isolate for 10 days after a positive test. But on Monday, it reduced that period to five days for those without symptoms and those without fevers whose other symptoms were resolving. Delta Air Lines was one of the first companies to adapt to the updated guidance. Its new policy, dated Tuesday, provides five days of paid leave for vaccinated workers who test positive for the coronavirus to isolate, according to an internal communication to company leaders obtained by The New York Times. The policy encourages, but does not require, a Covid test to go back to work — going a step further than the C.D.C. guidance, which does not include a recommendation for additional testing — and Delta is offering two additional days of paid time off for workers who test positive on Day 5. But the airline’s protocols make no mention of whether returning employees should have improving symptoms, as suggested by the C.D.C. Megabus, a long-distance bus operator, said Thursday that it is offering free rides on routes in the U.S. and Canada to travelers whose flights are canceled between Dec. 27 and Jan. 7.  Michigan health officials announced Thursday that the state will ignore new isolation guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pending “additional information.”  On Monday, the C.D.C. cut in half the recommended isolation period of 10 days for those with little or no symptoms. Those now leaving isolation should quarantine for five days and wear masks for an additional five days, federal health officials said.  In its statement, Michigan’s health department said it wanted to review the evidence behind the new isolation guidelines, including its application for high-risk groups, before it adopted the protocol.  Until then, the state “will retain current quarantine and isolation guidelines,” and have its residents follow the previous 10-day isolation period.  Health officials also expressed concern over a recent spike in cases across the state, thought to be the result of the new, and highly transmissible, Omicron variant. More than 9,000 people are testing positive every day in Michigan, a 40 percent jump over the last two weeks.  The new guidelines have divided health and government officials, who disagreed on whether or not they were necessary.  “The C.D.C. made a decision to balance what’s good for public health at the same time as keeping the society running,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said on News Nation’s “Morning in America” on Thursday.  Still, Dr. Fauci added, the new guidelines are not “100 percent risk-free.”  Others disagreed. The New York State Nurses Association issued its own statement on Dec. 24 in response to the new guidelines, calling the emergency guidance “potentially dangerous for health care workers and the communities we serve.”  “This guidance is inconsistent with proven science, vague, and doesn’t provide definitions or explain standards at a time when decision-making for health care systems is critical,” the organization said.  The Food and Drug Administration is planning to broaden eligibility for coronavirus vaccine booster doses on Monday, allowing 12- to 15-year-olds to receive third doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine, according to people familiar with the agency’s deliberations.  Regulators also plan to allow both adolescents and adults to seek an extra shot of Pfizer’s vaccine five months after receiving a second dose instead of the current period of six months. A booster shot is also expected to be authorized for younger children, ages 5 to 11, with immune deficiencies.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee is planning to meet by the middle of next week to vote on whether to recommend the changes. If the committee agrees with the F.D.A.’s authorizations, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, is expected to promptly endorse the revisions. The move to expand boosters comes as the highly contagious Omicron variant is infecting a record number of Americans with the coronavirus, putting more pressure on hospitals already deluged by Covid-19 patients from the Delta variant. More than 70 percent of people in the United States 12 years and older are fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C. At least 1.8 million adolescents between 12 and 15 years old have tested positive for the virus, according to the C.D.C. Children can better withstand coronavirus infections, but in rare instances still can get very sick and even die.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released two studies on Thursday that underscored the importance of vaccinating children against the coronavirus. One study found that serious problems among children 5 to 11 who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were extremely rare. The other, which looked at hundreds of pediatric hospitalizations in six cities last summer, found that nearly all of the children who became seriously ill had not been fully vaccinated. More than eight million doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been given to children 5 to 11 in the United States so far. But concerns about the unknowns of a new vaccine caused some parents to hesitate in allowing their children to be inoculated, including those who said they preferred to wait for the broader rollout to bring any rare problems to the surface. By Dec. 19, roughly six weeks into the campaign to vaccinate 5- to 11-year-olds, the C.D.C. said that it had received very few reports of serious problems. The agency evaluated reports received from doctors and members of the public, as well as survey responses from the parents or guardians of roughly 43,000 children in that age group. Many of the surveyed children reported pain at the site of the shot, fatigue, or a headache, especially after the second dose. Roughly 13 percent of those surveyed reported a fever after the second shot. But reports of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle that has been linked in rare cases to coronavirus vaccines, remained scarce. The C.D.C. said there were 11 verified reports that had come in from doctors, vaccine manufacturers or other members of the public. Of those, seven children had recovered and four were recovering at the time of the report, the C.D.C. said. The C.D.C. said that reporting rates for vaccine-related myocarditis appeared highest among boys and men aged 12 to 29. A number of parents or doctors also reported instances of 5- to 11-year-olds receiving the incorrect, larger vaccine dose meant for older children and adults. The C.D.C. said that those problems were “not unexpected,” and that most such reports mentioned that the children experienced no problems afterward. The C.D.C. detailed two reports of deaths, in girls ages 5 and 6, who the agency said had chronic medical conditions and were in “fragile health” before their shots. “On initial review, no data were found that would suggest a causal association between death and vaccination,” the agency said. The C.D.C.’s separate report on pediatric hospitalizations provided additional evidence about the importance of vaccinating all eligible children. The study, which looked at more than 700 children under 18 who were admitted to hospitals with Covid-19 last summer, found that 0.4 percent of those children who were eligible for the shots had been fully vaccinated. The study also found that two-thirds of all the hospitalized children had a comorbidity, most often obesity, and that about one-third of children 5 and older were sick with more than one viral infection. Overall, nearly one-third of the children were so sick they had to be treated in intensive care units, and almost 15 percent needed medical ventilation. Among all those hospitalized, 1.5 percent of the children died, the study found. The six hospitals were in Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Texas and Washington, D.C. “This study demonstrates that unvaccinated children hospitalized for Covid-19 could experience severe disease and reinforces the importance of vaccination of all eligible children to provide individual protection and to protect those who are not yet eligible to be vaccinated,” the authors of the study wrote. Crowds at home games for professional sports teams in Ontario, Canada, including the Toronto Raptors and the Maple Leafs, will be pared to 1,000 spectators or fewer under public health measures announced Thursday by the province’s authorities as the Omicron variant continues to fuel a rise in coronavirus infections. Sporting events, concerts and theaters will be limited to either 1,000 attendees or 50 percent of their usual capacity, whichever was fewer. The restrictions will take effect Friday and apply to the Maple Leafs and Ottawa Senators of the N.H.L., the Raptors of the N.B.A., and lower-level teams. Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, the parent company of the Toronto teams, said in a statement Thursday that it would “transition to operating without sold tickets,” starting Friday. The company expected the attendance cap would be in place for at least three weeks, at which point the province would reassess the situation. The Raptors will not be selling tickets to the general public, but “will honor our commitments under N.B.A. rule — so essentially family, friends, opposing team tickets,” Jennifer Quinn, the director of communications for the Raptors, said in an email. The N.H.L. last week decided to begin its scheduled holiday break early as the virus spread within its teams. After one game on Dec. 21, play didn’t resume until Tuesday. Even after its return, the league on Tuesday postponed a game because of virus issues, and postponed another nine games involving Canadian teams affected by attendance regulations, hoping they could host larger contingents of fans at a later date. Quinn said the Raptors and the N.B.A. had not discussed postponing games because of the capacity restrictions. The Raptors have six home games within the next three weeks. The N.B.A. has postponed 11 games this season, including three Raptors games, when at least one competing team did not have enough available players in part because of virus outbreaks. Ontario’s latest protocols further reduced capacity after earlier this month it cut the figure to 50 percent, or about 10,000 spectators, for the Maple Leafs, Senators and Raptors. Ontario is averaging nearly 10,000 cases per day, up 515 percent from two weeks ago. As the Omicron variant sweeps across the planet, the global tally of new coronavirus cases has for the first time passed one million per day on average. The previous global case record set last April has already been broken three times this week. The United States, Canada and much of Western Europe are leading the surge, with both regions seeing record-breaking levels of new coronavirus cases. The daily average number of new cases in the United States on Tuesday was more than 267,000, exceeding the previous all-time peak set in January; Wednesday’s average was higher still, at more than 300,000. New cases in at least 11 European countries — Britain, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Spain and Switzerland — also passed their previous all-time peaks on Tuesday or Wednesday. In France, the daily case average passed 100,000. Cases in Canada have also seen a steep increase in recent days, more than doubling in a week to an average of more than 25,000. And Australia’s cases climbed to an average of more than 12,600 on Wednesday — eight times higher than just three weeks earlier. Britain’s National Health Service “is now on a war footing,” one of its top medical officials warned on Thursday, saying its hospitals would erect field wards to help deal with the surge in coronavirus cases that has produced a steep rise in hospitalizations nationally. Health experts were bracing for more challenges in the coming weeks that would further strain the system, which is besieged by the absences of tens of thousands of health care workers who are sick themselves, or isolating. Officials also cautioned that absences could have a far-reaching impact on public services like transportation. Coronavirus cases in Britain reached new highs this week, driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant, with 183,037 cases reported across the country on Wednesday — twice the highest daily count recorded in previous waves. More than 10,000 people with the coronavirus were hospitalized in England on Wednesday, the highest number since March, though it is still unclear how many were hospitalized for illness caused by the virus and how many were there for another reason but also tested positive. On Thursday, the National Health Service outlined plans for new field hospitals in England in response to the wave of Omicron cases. These temporary facilities, called “Nightingale hubs,” will be capable of housing around 100 patients each, the health service said in a statement, and would be set up at eight hospitals across the country. “We do not yet know exactly how many of those who catch the virus will need hospital treatment,” Stephen Powis, the medical director of Britain’s National Health Service, said in a statement. “But given the number of infections we cannot wait to find out before we act and so work is beginning from today to ensure these facilities are in place.” JERUSALEM — Israel on Thursday approved a fourth dose of Covid vaccine for people with weakened immune systems, moving ahead of much of the world in taking a little-studied step to try to protect its most vulnerable against the fast-spreading Omicron variant. The decision by health officials came more than a week after an advisory panel of Israeli experts recommended a fourth dose for people with weak immune systems, as well as for others at high risk, including those aged 60 and over and health workers.  The panel had acknowledged the uncertainties and lack of data surrounding both Omicron and the fourth dose, but presented data indicating a significant waning of immunity in people aged 60 or older, who were the first to receive their third shots starting in August. At a news conference on Thursday evening, Prof. Nachman Ash, the director-general of Israel’s Ministry of Health, said the advisory panel’s recommendation had been partially accepted, and a fourth dose would be offered to those whose immune systems have been compromised by illness or treatments they are undergoing. “Given the gaps of knowledge that exist around the world regarding the efficiency of a fourth dose in the current circumstances, we are acting cautiously and responsibly,” Professor Ash said. He said Israeli health officials would continue to monitor the effects of Omicron in Israel and abroad, including the risk of severe illness in people who are already vaccinated, before taking any decision to broaden the rollout of a fourth dose for other vulnerable people, including the older population. Weighing the potential benefits of another booster shot against the risks, some scientists, including a few on the Israeli advisory panel, have voiced concern that too many vaccinations might cause a sort of immune system fatigue, compromising the body’s ability to fight the coronavirus, particularly among older people. The Sheba Medical Center, near Tel Aviv, began a study on Monday to test the safety and effectiveness of a fourth dose of a vaccine, administering an additional shot to 150 medical personnel who had received a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least four months ago. After Thursday’s announcement, officials there said the hospital would start administering fourth doses to heart transplant patients on Friday morning.  Developments in Israel, an early leader in Covid vaccinations, are being closely watched as governments worldwide struggle to confront the rapidly spreading Omicron variant, which is driving record numbers of new infections in parts of the United States, Europe and many other places. Israel was the first country to roll out third shots as boosters for the population at large, putting it in position to assess earlier than other countries how effective the shots are and how quickly the protection might wear off. Even as some studies suggest that Omicron infections are milder than those caused by other variants, the surges are already stretching health systems. Israel’s hospitals have already filled up with patients suffering from complications of winter flu and other respiratory ailments.  At least half the new daily cases in Israel are now believed to be from Omicron, and experts say that variant is likely to surpass Delta as the dominant variant in the country within a couple of weeks. Over four million Israelis have received a booster shot, out of a total population of nine million, but about a million eligible Israelis have not. In November, Israel became one of the first countries after the United States to approve Covid vaccinations for children aged 5 to 11, but the initial uptake in that age group has been slow. On Thursday, Israel received its first shipment of Pfizer’s coronavirus drug. Known as Paxlovid, it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week for Covid patients age 12 and over who are vulnerable to becoming severely ill because of their age or prior medical conditions. Crowds will return to Times Square on Friday for the annual ball drop, despite the surge in Covid-19 cases in New York City and across the country, but one notable act will not be there: the rapper LL Cool J, who announced he had tested positive for Covid on Wednesday. The singer Chloe Bailey also canceled on Wednesday, although she did not explain why. Several other musical acts are slated to perform, including KT Tunstall, Karol G and Journey.  Mayor Bill de Blasio announced last week that although New Year’s Eve celebrations would be scaled back somewhat this year, the ball drop would go on. Last year, only a small number of frontline workers and their families were allowed to attend. Although the public will be welcome once more to Times Square, revelers may want to think twice about watching the ball drop in person this year. New York City’s seven-day average test positivity rate was about 15 percent on Tuesday, according to the state. The event will also draw people from places around the country and the world with varying rates of Covid cases and vaccination. The celebrations will kick off at 6 p.m. in Times Square. Visitors won’t be allowed into the viewing areas until 3 p.m., hours later than in past years. Millions of rapid at-home Covid tests are flying off pharmacy shelves across the United States, giving Americans an instant, if sometimes imperfect, read on whether they are infected with the coronavirus. But the results are rarely reported to public health departments, exacerbating the longstanding challenges of maintaining an accurate count of cases at a time when the number of infections is surging because of the Omicron variant. At the minimum, the widespread availability of at-home tests is wreaking havoc with the accuracy of official positivity rates and case counts. At the other extreme, it is one factor making some public health experts raise a question that once would have been unthinkable: Do counts of coronavirus cases serve a useful purpose, and if not, should they be continued? “Our entire approach to the pandemic has been case-based surveillance: We have to count every case, and that’s just not accurate anymore,” said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, a national nonprofit organization representing public health agencies in the United States. “It’s just becoming a time where we’ve got to think about doing things differently.” British scientists announced on Thursday that a new study will find out if increasing the dosage of a cheap and readily available steroid can help patients with extremely severe cases of Covid-19. Dexamethasone became an unexpected sign of hope early on in the pandemic when scientists discovered that its use could save the lives of severely ill coronavirus patients. By reducing inflammation caused by the virus, and therefore stopping an immune reaction that could kill those infected, one estimate found that, had Britain implemented it earlier, 5,000 more people would still be alive. In a trial, scheduled to take place in the next few months, those with low oxygen levels will be administered the higher dosage. Instead of the standard six milligrams patients began receiving in June 2020, those in the new trial will receive more than double that: 20 milligrams for the first five days, followed by 10 for the remainder of the treatment. Scientists hope the higher quantity will reduce hospital stays, avoid the use of ventilators and prevent deaths. The same researchers who discovered the drug’s initial effectiveness are launching this new study, which will begin in a few months, because of an anticipated spike in hospitalizations, following a surge of coronavirus cases. Both the United States and a handful of European nations are shattering daily case records brought on largely by the highly contagious variant. Within weeks of its discovery in the U.S., more than 59 percent of new coronavirus cases in the country are now linked to Omicron. “Given how quickly the Omicron variant is spreading, we can expect to see patients admitted to hospital with severe Covid-19 for a while to come,” Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the University of Oxford, said in a statement. “This makes it very important that we continue to explore ways to further improve the care of patients with severe Covid-19.” Citigroup has expanded remote working for its U.S. employees as a surge in coronavirus cases disrupts Wall Street’s return-to-office plans. Again.“We are asking that you work from home for the first few weeks of the new year if you are able to do so,” Citigroup said in a memo to staff on Thursday. “We will continue to monitor the data and provide an update in January on when we expect to be back in the office.” Citigroup’s new guidance applies to employees in more than 30 offices around the country who had been called back since September. Employees in New York City and New Jersey were already given the option to work from home in the final weeks of the year.JPMorgan Chase gave employees more flexibility to work from home in the first two weeks of January, but expects them to return to in-office schedules no later than Feb. 1, according to a memo to employees.“We are not changing our long-term plans of working in the office,” the bank’s operating committee said in the memo. The company may also amend its policy on vaccinations, which it has not required so far.“Government-issued vaccine mandates may likely make it difficult or impossible for us to continue to employ unvaccinated employees, so getting the vaccine is very important,” the memo said. The bank may soon require a booster shot for people entering its buildings. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has prompted big Wall Street companies, which have been eager to bring workers back, to press pause on those plans. Wells Fargo postponed its return to the office, while corporate employees at Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank were given more leeway to work remotely over the holidays. Goldman Sachs has bucked the trend. The investment bank, which called most workers back to the office in June, will require a booster for all employees eligible to receive one beginning Feb. 1, and it will require staff to be tested for the virus twice a week at on-site testing centers starting Jan. 10. Currently, employees in the office must get tested once a week. CHICAGO — Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois urged hospitals on Thursday to postpone nonemergency surgeries as the state seeks to preserve bed availability in the face of record numbers of new cases. “We’re asking our residents to temporarily hold off on important medical care like tonsillectomies, bariatric surgeries and hernia repair,” Mr. Pritzker, a Democrat, said in a statement, adding that he expected the case surge to continue into the new year.  Like in much of the country, cases in Illinois are spiking as the highly infectious Omicron variant takes hold. The state is averaging more than 16,000 new cases a day, compared to about 4,400 daily at the start of December. Around 4,600 Illinoisans with the virus are hospitalized, up 35 percent over the last two weeks but still well below the peak levels seen last winter. Early data suggests that Omicron causes milder illness than previous forms of the virus. Though businesses remain open, the virus has encroached on daily life in Illinois in increasingly obvious ways. Chicago residents are lining up on chilly sidewalks outside storefront testing centers. Several colleges have announced that they will begin the new academic term with online classes. Driver’s license offices will close next week because of rising infection levels. And earlier Thursday, the state’s lieutenant governor, Juliana Stratton, said that she had tested positive. Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the state’s public health director, warned in a statement about health care worker shortages and growing fatigue among doctors and nurses. Case rates are especially high around Champaign, Chicago and Peoria. “We are currently seeing approximately 500 new admissions a day to Illinois hospitals due to Covid-19, and approximately 90 percent of those are unvaccinated,” Dr. Ezike said, adding that “we’re seeing health care workers leave the profession because they are burned out after watching people suffer severe illness and even death for almost two years now.” Unlike the rest of the Midwest, Illinois continues to have a statewide mask mandate. And starting Monday, people in Chicago hoping to eat indoors or go to gyms will have to prove that they are vaccinated.  Still, much of daily life continues even as the virus data worsens. Chicago Public Schools students are scheduled to return to class on Monday. And a New Year’s Eve fireworks display along the Chicago waterfront is expected to go ahead, with watch parties planned at several downtown businesses.

This Omicron wave is over in the city of Tshwane. It was a flash flood more than a wave.” The rise in deaths over the period was small, and in the last week, officials said, “marginal.” Some scientists were quick to forecast the same pattern elsewhere. “We’ll be in for a tough January, as cases will keep going up and peak, and then fall fast,” said Ali Mokdad, a University of Washington epidemiologist who is a former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientist. While cases will still overwhelm hospitals, he said, he expects that the proportion of hospitalized cases will be lower than in earlier waves. Omicron, bearing dozens of troubling mutations, was first identified in Botswana and South Africa in late November. It rapidly became dominant in South Africa, sending case counts skyrocketing to a pandemic peak averaging more than 23,000 cases a day by mid-December, according to the Our World in Data project at Oxford University. As of last week, Omicron appeared in 95 percent of all new positive test samples that were genetically sequenced. It has spread to more than 100 countries, infecting previously vaccinated and previously infected people, and its proliferation has strained hospitals and thinned work forces in countries like the United States and Britain. In South Africa, overall case counts have been falling for two weeks, plummeting 30 percent in the last week to an average of less than 11,500 a day. Confirmed cases declined in all provinces except Western Cape and Eastern Cape, the data showed, and there was a drop in hospitalizations in all provinces except Western Cape. There are many caveats. The case figures might have been distorted by reduced testing during the holiday season. And many people in the most affected area had some measure of immunity, either from vaccination, prior infection or both, that might have protected them from serious illness. However, research teams in South Africa, Scotland and England have found that Omicron infections more often result in mild illness than earlier variants of the coronavirus, causing fewer hospitalizations. South African officials last week ended tracing efforts and scrapped quarantine for people who were possibly exposed but not experiencing symptoms. “Containment strategies are no longer appropriate — mitigation is the only viable strategy,” the government said then. On Thursday, the government announced an end to its midnight-to-4 a.m. curfew. Still, gatherings are limited to 1,000 people indoors, with appropriate social distancing, and 2,000 people outdoors. Face coverings in public places are mandatory. With more than 580,000 cases, the United States shattered its own record for new daily coronavirus cases — beating a milestone it already broke just the day before. Thursday’s count, according to The New York Times’s database, toppled the 488,000 new cases on Wednesday, which was nearly double the highest numbers from last winter. The back-to-back record-breaking days are a growing sign of the virus’s fast spread and come as the world enters its third year of the pandemic. Hospitalizations and deaths, however, have not followed the same dramatic increase, further indication that the Omicron variant seems to be milder than Delta and causes fewer cases of severe illness. In the past two weeks, deaths are down by five percent, with a daily average of 1,221, while hospitalizations increased by just 15 percent to an average of 78,781 per day.  Across the country, airlines canceled thousands of flights, leaving would-be travelers stranded, while others waited in line for hours to get their hands on a coronavirus test.  The high numbers are even more striking considering that experts associate the holiday season with major disturbances in testing and data reporting. The rise of at-home tests could also mean some cases aren’t making into the official count.  Last year, the so-called holiday curve showed a major decline in cases after Thanksgiving and Christmas, which underreported the spike in cases that actually took place. It’s likely that this season many more people have the virus than what’s being accounted for; just how many may not be clear for another few weeks.  The worldwide surge is being propelled by the new variant, Omicron. And while it is more infectious, research shows that cases with the variant are milder. Vaccinations are already proven to reduce the severity of the virus.  The majority of Americans, 62 percent, are fully vaccinated, according to The New York Times’s database. Nearly three-quarters of people have received at least one dose. And 68.8 million of those fully vaccinated have also received a third dose, or booster shot, since Aug. 13, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday raised its Covid-19 warning level for cruise ships to 4, the highest, and issued a blunt warning: “Avoid cruise travel regardless of vaccination status.” The move came as the number of outbreaks on ships has grown in recent weeks, causing some ports to turn away ships. Last week, dozens of people on a Royal Caribbean International ship tested positive after it set sail from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and a Carnival Cruise Line ship returned to Miami on Sunday after positive tests among “a small number on board.” Calling the C.D.C.’s decision “perplexing,” the cruise industry’s trade group, Cruise Lines International Association, said in a statement that the number of cases onboard made up a very slim minority of the total population and that “the majority of cases were asymptomatic or mild in nature, posing little to no burden on medical resources onboard or onshore.” Before the C.D.C.’s warning on Thursday, Royal Caribbean Group, one of the biggest cruise companies, said its ships had carried 1.1 million guests since it had restarted U.S. operations in June, with 1,745 people testing positive. While the majority of passengers had mild or no symptoms, 41 people were hospitalized. “Omicron is having a big short-term impact on everyone, but many observers see this as a major step towards Covid-19 becoming endemic rather than epidemic,” said Richard D. Fain, chairman and chief executive of Royal Caribbean Cruises. Despite the increase in cruise ship cases, Mexico’s government announced this week that it would let cruise ships dock at its ports even if passengers have tested positive for the coronavirus, and also allow asymptomatic travelers to disembark on its shores. The announcement came after two cruise ships with Covid outbreaks were refused permission by the authorities in Jalisco State in the last week to let passengers or crew disembark at Puerto Vallarta, a popular tourist destination on Mexico’s Pacific coast. “Our country maintains its policy of solidarity and fraternity, as well as the principle of non-discrimination towards all people,” the government said in a statement. “The health and tourism authorities remain attentive to provide the necessary medical assistance to those who visit us.” The coronavirus wreaked havoc on the cruise industry in the early stages of the pandemic, infecting hundreds of cruise passengers and workers and requiring the sector to shut down for 18 months. To begin sailing, cruise ships had to agree to the C.D.C.’s Conditional Sailing Order, which is valid until Jan. 15. On most cruises out of U.S. ports, almost all crew members and adult passengers are vaccinated and masks are required indoors except for when passengers are eating or drinking.  Among the safety measures the order requires — beyond submitting the daily number of coronavirus cases — is a prevention and control plan for each cruise ship.  Most cruise companies do not publicly announce the number of coronavirus cases identified during sailings, but all cruise ships operating to and from U.S. ports must submit daily numbers to the C.D.C., which uses a color-coded system to inform the public whether the number of cases is above or below the agency’s threshold for an investigation. Currently 88 cruise ships are being monitored by the C.D.C. because of reported coronavirus cases onboard. The agency does not publicly specify the number of cases on each ship. Some Covid infected, asymptomatic sailors from a ship docked at Guantánamo Bay with a coronavirus outbreak were removed from the ship and its environs before Christmas and put in quarantine in a base hotel, the Navy said Thursday. The Navy had previously reported that all the sailors had remained aboard the ship.  The U.S.S. Milwaukee arrived at Guantánamo Bay on Dec. 20 with a fully vaccinated crew of 105 sailors and Coast Guard members, some sick with the virus. It has been docked there since, as officials grapple with an outbreak among 25 percent of the crew.  None required hospitalization or medical evacuation from the remote base in southeast Cuba, Guantánamo health officials said, and those who did become sick experienced symptoms that were “mild in nature,” according to Cmdr. Kate Meadows, a spokeswoman for the Fourth Fleet in Jacksonville. Commander Meadows had earlier said that none of the sailors had left the ship or its immediate pier area since arriving at Guantánamo. Instead, she said crew members celebrated Christmas on the ship or in fresh air at the pier, segregated from the base, which has a mixed civilian and military population of about 6,000 residents, of whom about 900 are unvaccinated.  On Thursday, she clarified that some sailors who tested positive but were asymptomatic were moved to a hotel in the center of the base “due to limited berthing.”  She declined to say how many were moved but a Navy official, who was not authorized to be identified by name, elaborated that five sailors were moved ashore, so that the ship could strictly segregate the infected members on board from those who were Covid free. The sailors brought ashore were checked in “remotely” to a Navy run hotel, had no contact with staff and were placed in rooms with orange signs signifying the occupants were under quarantine, said the base spokeswoman, Nikki Maxwell. Navy health officials had yet to establish which variant of the virus had infected the sailors. “The sailors remaining with symptoms continue to only be mild in nature, again showing the importance of the vaccine and aggressive cleaning measures onboard,” Commander Meadows said. The U.S.S. Milwaukee departed its home port in Jacksonville, Fla., on Dec. 15 to undertake an anti-drug-trafficking mission under the direction of the U.S. Southern Command. The ship is expected to return to the mission in the new year. Airlines have been preparing for the holiday season for months, reviewing plans and readying reserves of workers. But that wasn’t enough to mitigate the effects of the fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus and of heavy snow and strong winds in the West. The impact continued to be felt on Thursday, with more than 1,200 cancellations of flights to, from or within the United States by afternoon, according to the air travel data site FlightAware. The site also showed more than 640 cancellations for Friday. The continued disruption comes as the country is averaging more than 260,000 new coronavirus cases a day, greater than the peak levels from last winter. Infection rates are especially high in parts of the Northeast and Midwest. Caseloads have continued to increase rapidly as the Omicron variant spreads, though deaths and hospitalizations have remained relatively steady.  The surge has disrupted far more than air travel. New York City has slowed to a crawl as the virus thins the ranks of subway workers and emergency personnel. Cincinnati declared a state of emergency on Wednesday to help the city deal with labor shortages within the city’s Fire Department amid a spike in coronavirus cases that coincided with scheduled holiday vacations. Many cities have canceled or limited New Year’s celebrations. More broadly, the pandemic has caused months of havoc in supply chains.  The air carriers hit hard on Thursday included JetBlue, with 17 percent of its total flights canceled. JetBlue said Wednesday that it was reducing its schedule through Jan. 13. In a statement, the airline said it had “seen a surge” in sick calls because of the Omicron variant, hampering its ability to staff its flights suitably even though it started the holidays with more workers than at any point since the pandemic began. “We expect the number of Covid cases in the Northeast — where most of our crew members are based — to continue to surge for the next week or two,” the company said. “This means there is a high likelihood of additional cancellations until case counts start to come down.” Alaska Airlines, whose primary hub is Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, canceled 14 percent of its flights. Relentless snowfall and record low temperatures in the Pacific Northwest grounded planes last week, and it snowed again in Seattle on Thursday. Looking to relieve its staffing squeeze, the airline industry pushed for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to shorten its recommended isolation period for Americans infected with Covid-19. The agency had previously recommended that infected patients isolate for 10 days after a positive test. But on Monday, it reduced that period to five days for those without symptoms and those without fevers whose other symptoms were resolving. Delta Air Lines was one of the first companies to adapt to the updated guidance. Its new policy, dated Tuesday, provides five days of paid leave for vaccinated workers who test positive for the coronavirus to isolate, according to an internal communication to company leaders obtained by The New York Times. The policy encourages, but does not require, a Covid test to go back to work — going a step further than the C.D.C. guidance, which does not include a recommendation for additional testing — and Delta is offering two additional days of paid time off for workers who test positive on Day 5. But the airline’s protocols make no mention of whether returning employees should have improving symptoms, as suggested by the C.D.C. Megabus, a long-distance bus operator, said Thursday that it is offering free rides on routes in the U.S. and Canada to travelers whose flights are canceled between Dec. 27 and Jan. 7.  Michigan health officials announced Thursday that the state will ignore new isolation guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pending “additional information.”  On Monday, the C.D.C. cut in half the recommended isolation period of 10 days for those with little or no symptoms. Those now leaving isolation should quarantine for five days and wear masks for an additional five days, federal health officials said.  In its statement, Michigan’s health department said it wanted to review the evidence behind the new isolation guidelines, including its application for high-risk groups, before it adopted the protocol.  Until then, the state “will retain current quarantine and isolation guidelines,” and have its residents follow the previous 10-day isolation period.  Health officials also expressed concern over a recent spike in cases across the state, thought to be the result of the new, and highly transmissible, Omicron variant. More than 9,000 people are testing positive every day in Michigan, a 40 percent jump over the last two weeks.  The new guidelines have divided health and government officials, who disagreed on whether or not they were necessary.  “The C.D.C. made a decision to balance what’s good for public health at the same time as keeping the society running,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said on News Nation’s “Morning in America” on Thursday.  Still, Dr. Fauci added, the new guidelines are not “100 percent risk-free.”  Others disagreed. The New York State Nurses Association issued its own statement on Dec. 24 in response to the new guidelines, calling the emergency guidance “potentially dangerous for health care workers and the communities we serve.”  “This guidance is inconsistent with proven science, vague, and doesn’t provide definitions or explain standards at a time when decision-making for health care systems is critical,” the organization said.  The Food and Drug Administration is planning to broaden eligibility for coronavirus vaccine booster doses on Monday, allowing 12- to 15-year-olds to receive third doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine, according to people familiar with the agency’s deliberations.  Regulators also plan to allow both adolescents and adults to seek an extra shot of Pfizer’s vaccine five months after receiving a second dose instead of the current period of six months. A booster shot is also expected to be authorized for younger children, ages 5 to 11, with immune deficiencies.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee is planning to meet by the middle of next week to vote on whether to recommend the changes. If the committee agrees with the F.D.A.’s authorizations, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, is expected to promptly endorse the revisions. The move to expand boosters comes as the highly contagious Omicron variant is infecting a record number of Americans with the coronavirus, putting more pressure on hospitals already deluged by Covid-19 patients from the Delta variant. More than 70 percent of people in the United States 12 years and older are fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C. At least 1.8 million adolescents between 12 and 15 years old have tested positive for the virus, according to the C.D.C. Children can better withstand coronavirus infections, but in rare instances still can get very sick and even die.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released two studies on Thursday that underscored the importance of vaccinating children against the coronavirus. One study found that serious problems among children 5 to 11 who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were extremely rare. The other, which looked at hundreds of pediatric hospitalizations in six cities last summer, found that nearly all of the children who became seriously ill had not been fully vaccinated. More than eight million doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been given to children 5 to 11 in the United States so far. But concerns about the unknowns of a new vaccine caused some parents to hesitate in allowing their children to be inoculated, including those who said they preferred to wait for the broader rollout to bring any rare problems to the surface. By Dec. 19, roughly six weeks into the campaign to vaccinate 5- to 11-year-olds, the C.D.C. said that it had received very few reports of serious problems. The agency evaluated reports received from doctors and members of the public, as well as survey responses from the parents or guardians of roughly 43,000 children in that age group. Many of the surveyed children reported pain at the site of the shot, fatigue, or a headache, especially after the second dose. Roughly 13 percent of those surveyed reported a fever after the second shot. But reports of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle that has been linked in rare cases to coronavirus vaccines, remained scarce. The C.D.C. said there were 11 verified reports that had come in from doctors, vaccine manufacturers or other members of the public. Of those, seven children had recovered and four were recovering at the time of the report, the C.D.C. said. The C.D.C. said that reporting rates for vaccine-related myocarditis appeared highest among boys and men aged 12 to 29. A number of parents or doctors also reported instances of 5- to 11-year-olds receiving the incorrect, larger vaccine dose meant for older children and adults. The C.D.C. said that those problems were “not unexpected,” and that most such reports mentioned that the children experienced no problems afterward. The C.D.C. detailed two reports of deaths, in girls ages 5 and 6, who the agency said had chronic medical conditions and were in “fragile health” before their shots. “On initial review, no data were found that would suggest a causal association between death and vaccination,” the agency said. The C.D.C.’s separate report on pediatric hospitalizations provided additional evidence about the importance of vaccinating all eligible children. The study, which looked at more than 700 children under 18 who were admitted to hospitals with Covid-19 last summer, found that 0.4 percent of those children who were eligible for the shots had been fully vaccinated. The study also found that two-thirds of all the hospitalized children had a comorbidity, most often obesity, and that about one-third of children 5 and older were sick with more than one viral infection. Overall, nearly one-third of the children were so sick they had to be treated in intensive care units, and almost 15 percent needed medical ventilation. Among all those hospitalized, 1.5 percent of the children died, the study found. The six hospitals were in Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Texas and Washington, D.C. “This study demonstrates that unvaccinated children hospitalized for Covid-19 could experience severe disease and reinforces the importance of vaccination of all eligible children to provide individual protection and to protect those who are not yet eligible to be vaccinated,” the authors of the study wrote. Crowds at home games for professional sports teams in Ontario, Canada, including the Toronto Raptors and the Maple Leafs, will be pared to 1,000 spectators or fewer under public health measures announced Thursday by the province’s authorities as the Omicron variant continues to fuel a rise in coronavirus infections. Sporting events, concerts and theaters will be limited to either 1,000 attendees or 50 percent of their usual capacity, whichever was fewer. The restrictions will take effect Friday and apply to the Maple Leafs and Ottawa Senators of the N.H.L., the Raptors of the N.B.A., and lower-level teams. Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, the parent company of the Toronto teams, said in a statement Thursday that it would “transition to operating without sold tickets,” starting Friday. The company expected the attendance cap would be in place for at least three weeks, at which point the province would reassess the situation. The Raptors will not be selling tickets to the general public, but “will honor our commitments under N.B.A. rule — so essentially family, friends, opposing team tickets,” Jennifer Quinn, the director of communications for the Raptors, said in an email. The N.H.L. last week decided to begin its scheduled holiday break early as the virus spread within its teams. After one game on Dec. 21, play didn’t resume until Tuesday. Even after its return, the league on Tuesday postponed a game because of virus issues, and postponed another nine games involving Canadian teams affected by attendance regulations, hoping they could host larger contingents of fans at a later date. Quinn said the Raptors and the N.B.A. had not discussed postponing games because of the capacity restrictions. The Raptors have six home games within the next three weeks. The N.B.A. has postponed 11 games this season, including three Raptors games, when at least one competing team did not have enough available players in part because of virus outbreaks. Ontario’s latest protocols further reduced capacity after earlier this month it cut the figure to 50 percent, or about 10,000 spectators, for the Maple Leafs, Senators and Raptors. Ontario is averaging nearly 10,000 cases per day, up 515 percent from two weeks ago. As the Omicron variant sweeps across the planet, the global tally of new coronavirus cases has for the first time passed one million per day on average. The previous global case record set last April has already been broken three times this week. The United States, Canada and much of Western Europe are leading the surge, with both regions seeing record-breaking levels of new coronavirus cases. The daily average number of new cases in the United States on Tuesday was more than 267,000, exceeding the previous all-time peak set in January; Wednesday’s average was higher still, at more than 300,000. New cases in at least 11 European countries — Britain, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Spain and Switzerland — also passed their previous all-time peaks on Tuesday or Wednesday. In France, the daily case average passed 100,000. Cases in Canada have also seen a steep increase in recent days, more than doubling in a week to an average of more than 25,000. And Australia’s cases climbed to an average of more than 12,600 on Wednesday — eight times higher than just three weeks earlier. Britain’s National Health Service “is now on a war footing,” one of its top medical officials warned on Thursday, saying its hospitals would erect field wards to help deal with the surge in coronavirus cases that has produced a steep rise in hospitalizations nationally. Health experts were bracing for more challenges in the coming weeks that would further strain the system, which is besieged by the absences of tens of thousands of health care workers who are sick themselves, or isolating. Officials also cautioned that absences could have a far-reaching impact on public services like transportation. Coronavirus cases in Britain reached new highs this week, driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant, with 183,037 cases reported across the country on Wednesday — twice the highest daily count recorded in previous waves. More than 10,000 people with the coronavirus were hospitalized in England on Wednesday, the highest number since March, though it is still unclear how many were hospitalized for illness caused by the virus and how many were there for another reason but also tested positive. On Thursday, the National Health Service outlined plans for new field hospitals in England in response to the wave of Omicron cases. These temporary facilities, called “Nightingale hubs,” will be capable of housing around 100 patients each, the health service said in a statement, and would be set up at eight hospitals across the country. “We do not yet know exactly how many of those who catch the virus will need hospital treatment,” Stephen Powis, the medical director of Britain’s National Health Service, said in a statement. “But given the number of infections we cannot wait to find out before we act and so work is beginning from today to ensure these facilities are in place.” JERUSALEM — Israel on Thursday approved a fourth dose of Covid vaccine for people with weakened immune systems, moving ahead of much of the world in taking a little-studied step to try to protect its most vulnerable against the fast-spreading Omicron variant. The decision by health officials came more than a week after an advisory panel of Israeli experts recommended a fourth dose for people with weak immune systems, as well as for others at high risk, including those aged 60 and over and health workers.  The panel had acknowledged the uncertainties and lack of data surrounding both Omicron and the fourth dose, but presented data indicating a significant waning of immunity in people aged 60 or older, who were the first to receive their third shots starting in August. At a news conference on Thursday evening, Prof. Nachman Ash, the director-general of Israel’s Ministry of Health, said the advisory panel’s recommendation had been partially accepted, and a fourth dose would be offered to those whose immune systems have been compromised by illness or treatments they are undergoing. “Given the gaps of knowledge that exist around the world regarding the efficiency of a fourth dose in the current circumstances, we are acting cautiously and responsibly,” Professor Ash said. He said Israeli health officials would continue to monitor the effects of Omicron in Israel and abroad, including the risk of severe illness in people who are already vaccinated, before taking any decision to broaden the rollout of a fourth dose for other vulnerable people, including the older population. Weighing the potential benefits of another booster shot against the risks, some scientists, including a few on the Israeli advisory panel, have voiced concern that too many vaccinations might cause a sort of immune system fatigue, compromising the body’s ability to fight the coronavirus, particularly among older people. The Sheba Medical Center, near Tel Aviv, began a study on Monday to test the safety and effectiveness of a fourth dose of a vaccine, administering an additional shot to 150 medical personnel who had received a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least four months ago. After Thursday’s announcement, officials there said the hospital would start administering fourth doses to heart transplant patients on Friday morning.  Developments in Israel, an early leader in Covid vaccinations, are being closely watched as governments worldwide struggle to confront the rapidly spreading Omicron variant, which is driving record numbers of new infections in parts of the United States, Europe and many other places. Israel was the first country to roll out third shots as boosters for the population at large, putting it in position to assess earlier than other countries how effective the shots are and how quickly the protection might wear off. Even as some studies suggest that Omicron infections are milder than those caused by other variants, the surges are already stretching health systems. Israel’s hospitals have already filled up with patients suffering from complications of winter flu and other respiratory ailments.  At least half the new daily cases in Israel are now believed to be from Omicron, and experts say that variant is likely to surpass Delta as the dominant variant in the country within a couple of weeks. Over four million Israelis have received a booster shot, out of a total population of nine million, but about a million eligible Israelis have not. In November, Israel became one of the first countries after the United States to approve Covid vaccinations for children aged 5 to 11, but the initial uptake in that age group has been slow. On Thursday, Israel received its first shipment of Pfizer’s coronavirus drug. Known as Paxlovid, it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week for Covid patients age 12 and over who are vulnerable to becoming severely ill because of their age or prior medical conditions. Crowds will return to Times Square on Friday for the annual ball drop, despite the surge in Covid-19 cases in New York City and across the country, but one notable act will not be there: the rapper LL Cool J, who announced he had tested positive for Covid on Wednesday. The singer Chloe Bailey also canceled on Wednesday, although she did not explain why. Several other musical acts are slated to perform, including KT Tunstall, Karol G and Journey.  Mayor Bill de Blasio announced last week that although New Year’s Eve celebrations would be scaled back somewhat this year, the ball drop would go on. Last year, only a small number of frontline workers and their families were allowed to attend. Although the public will be welcome once more to Times Square, revelers may want to think twice about watching the ball drop in person this year. New York City’s seven-day average test positivity rate was about 15 percent on Tuesday, according to the state. The event will also draw people from places around the country and the world with varying rates of Covid cases and vaccination. The celebrations will kick off at 6 p.m. in Times Square. Visitors won’t be allowed into the viewing areas until 3 p.m., hours later than in past years. Millions of rapid at-home Covid tests are flying off pharmacy shelves across the United States, giving Americans an instant, if sometimes imperfect, read on whether they are infected with the coronavirus. But the results are rarely reported to public health departments, exacerbating the longstanding challenges of maintaining an accurate count of cases at a time when the number of infections is surging because of the Omicron variant. At the minimum, the widespread availability of at-home tests is wreaking havoc with the accuracy of official positivity rates and case counts. At the other extreme, it is one factor making some public health experts raise a question that once would have been unthinkable: Do counts of coronavirus cases serve a useful purpose, and if not, should they be continued? “Our entire approach to the pandemic has been case-based surveillance: We have to count every case, and that’s just not accurate anymore,” said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, a national nonprofit organization representing public health agencies in the United States. “It’s just becoming a time where we’ve got to think about doing things differently.” British scientists announced on Thursday that a new study will find out if increasing the dosage of a cheap and readily available steroid can help patients with extremely severe cases of Covid-19. Dexamethasone became an unexpected sign of hope early on in the pandemic when scientists discovered that its use could save the lives of severely ill coronavirus patients. By reducing inflammation caused by the virus, and therefore stopping an immune reaction that could kill those infected, one estimate found that, had Britain implemented it earlier, 5,000 more people would still be alive. In a trial, scheduled to take place in the next few months, those with low oxygen levels will be administered the higher dosage. Instead of the standard six milligrams patients began receiving in June 2020, those in the new trial will receive more than double that: 20 milligrams for the first five days, followed by 10 for the remainder of the treatment. Scientists hope the higher quantity will reduce hospital stays, avoid the use of ventilators and prevent deaths. The same researchers who discovered the drug’s initial effectiveness are launching this new study, which will begin in a few months, because of an anticipated spike in hospitalizations, following a surge of coronavirus cases. Both the United States and a handful of European nations are shattering daily case records brought on largely by the highly contagious variant. Within weeks of its discovery in the U.S., more than 59 percent of new coronavirus cases in the country are now linked to Omicron. “Given how quickly the Omicron variant is spreading, we can expect to see patients admitted to hospital with severe Covid-19 for a while to come,” Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the University of Oxford, said in a statement. “This makes it very important that we continue to explore ways to further improve the care of patients with severe Covid-19.” Citigroup has expanded remote working for its U.S. employees as a surge in coronavirus cases disrupts Wall Street’s return-to-office plans. Again.“We are asking that you work from home for the first few weeks of the new year if you are able to do so,” Citigroup said in a memo to staff on Thursday. “We will continue to monitor the data and provide an update in January on when we expect to be back in the office.” Citigroup’s new guidance applies to employees in more than 30 offices around the country who had been called back since September. Employees in New York City and New Jersey were already given the option to work from home in the final weeks of the year.JPMorgan Chase gave employees more flexibility to work from home in the first two weeks of January, but expects them to return to in-office schedules no later than Feb. 1, according to a memo to employees.“We are not changing our long-term plans of working in the office,” the bank’s operating committee said in the memo. The company may also amend its policy on vaccinations, which it has not required so far.“Government-issued vaccine mandates may likely make it difficult or impossible for us to continue to employ unvaccinated employees, so getting the vaccine is very important,” the memo said. The bank may soon require a booster shot for people entering its buildings. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has prompted big Wall Street companies, which have been eager to bring workers back, to press pause on those plans. Wells Fargo postponed its return to the office, while corporate employees at Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank were given more leeway to work remotely over the holidays. Goldman Sachs has bucked the trend. The investment bank, which called most workers back to the office in June, will require a booster for all employees eligible to receive one beginning Feb. 1, and it will require staff to be tested for the virus twice a week at on-site testing centers starting Jan. 10. Currently, employees in the office must get tested once a week. CHICAGO — Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois urged hospitals on Thursday to postpone nonemergency surgeries as the state seeks to preserve bed availability in the face of record numbers of new cases. “We’re asking our residents to temporarily hold off on important medical care like tonsillectomies, bariatric surgeries and hernia repair,” Mr. Pritzker, a Democrat, said in a statement, adding that he expected the case surge to continue into the new year.  Like in much of the country, cases in Illinois are spiking as the highly infectious Omicron variant takes hold. The state is averaging more than 16,000 new cases a day, compared to about 4,400 daily at the start of December. Around 4,600 Illinoisans with the virus are hospitalized, up 35 percent over the last two weeks but still well below the peak levels seen last winter. Early data suggests that Omicron causes milder illness than previous forms of the virus. Though businesses remain open, the virus has encroached on daily life in Illinois in increasingly obvious ways. Chicago residents are lining up on chilly sidewalks outside storefront testing centers. Several colleges have announced that they will begin the new academic term with online classes. Driver’s license offices will close next week because of rising infection levels. And earlier Thursday, the state’s lieutenant governor, Juliana Stratton, said that she had tested positive. Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the state’s public health director, warned in a statement about health care worker shortages and growing fatigue among doctors and nurses. Case rates are especially high around Champaign, Chicago and Peoria. “We are currently seeing approximately 500 new admissions a day to Illinois hospitals due to Covid-19, and approximately 90 percent of those are unvaccinated,” Dr. Ezike said, adding that “we’re seeing health care workers leave the profession because they are burned out after watching people suffer severe illness and even death for almost two years now.” Unlike the rest of the Midwest, Illinois continues to have a statewide mask mandate. And starting Monday, people in Chicago hoping to eat indoors or go to gyms will have to prove that they are vaccinated.  Still, much of daily life continues even as the virus data worsens. Chicago Public Schools students are scheduled to return to class on Monday. And a New Year’s Eve fireworks display along the Chicago waterfront is expected to go ahead, with watch parties planned at several downtown businesses.

This Omicron wave is over in the city of Tshwane. It was a flash flood more than a wave.” The rise in deaths over the period was small, and in the last week, officials said, “marginal.” Some scientists were quick to forecast the same pattern elsewhere. “We’ll be in for a tough January, as cases will keep going up and peak, and then fall fast,” said Ali Mokdad, a University of Washington epidemiologist who is a former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientist. While cases will still overwhelm hospitals, he said, he expects that the proportion of hospitalized cases will be lower than in earlier waves. Omicron, bearing dozens of troubling mutations, was first identified in Botswana and South Africa in late November. It rapidly became dominant in South Africa, sending case counts skyrocketing to a pandemic peak averaging more than 23,000 cases a day by mid-December, according to the Our World in Data project at Oxford University. As of last week, Omicron appeared in 95 percent of all new positive test samples that were genetically sequenced. It has spread to more than 100 countries, infecting previously vaccinated and previously infected people, and its proliferation has strained hospitals and thinned work forces in countries like the United States and Britain. In South Africa, overall case counts have been falling for two weeks, plummeting 30 percent in the last week to an average of less than 11,500 a day. Confirmed cases declined in all provinces except Western Cape and Eastern Cape, the data showed, and there was a drop in hospitalizations in all provinces except Western Cape. There are many caveats. The case figures might have been distorted by reduced testing during the holiday season. And many people in the most affected area had some measure of immunity, either from vaccination, prior infection or both, that might have protected them from serious illness. However, research teams in South Africa, Scotland and England have found that Omicron infections more often result in mild illness than earlier variants of the coronavirus, causing fewer hospitalizations. South African officials last week ended tracing efforts and scrapped quarantine for people who were possibly exposed but not experiencing symptoms. “Containment strategies are no longer appropriate — mitigation is the only viable strategy,” the government said then. On Thursday, the government announced an end to its midnight-to-4 a.m. curfew. Still, gatherings are limited to 1,000 people indoors, with appropriate social distancing, and 2,000 people outdoors. Face coverings in public places are mandatory. With more than 580,000 cases, the United States shattered its own record for new daily coronavirus cases — beating a milestone it already broke just the day before. Thursday’s count, according to The New York Times’s database, toppled the 488,000 new cases on Wednesday, which was nearly double the highest numbers from last winter. The back-to-back record-breaking days are a growing sign of the virus’s fast spread and come as the world enters its third year of the pandemic. Hospitalizations and deaths, however, have not followed the same dramatic increase, further indication that the Omicron variant seems to be milder than Delta and causes fewer cases of severe illness. In the past two weeks, deaths are down by five percent, with a daily average of 1,221, while hospitalizations increased by just 15 percent to an average of 78,781 per day.  Across the country, airlines canceled thousands of flights, leaving would-be travelers stranded, while others waited in line for hours to get their hands on a coronavirus test.  The high numbers are even more striking considering that experts associate the holiday season with major disturbances in testing and data reporting. The rise of at-home tests could also mean some cases aren’t making into the official count.  Last year, the so-called holiday curve showed a major decline in cases after Thanksgiving and Christmas, which underreported the spike in cases that actually took place. It’s likely that this season many more people have the virus than what’s being accounted for; just how many may not be clear for another few weeks.  The worldwide surge is being propelled by the new variant, Omicron. And while it is more infectious, research shows that cases with the variant are milder. Vaccinations are already proven to reduce the severity of the virus.  The majority of Americans, 62 percent, are fully vaccinated, according to The New York Times’s database. Nearly three-quarters of people have received at least one dose. And 68.8 million of those fully vaccinated have also received a third dose, or booster shot, since Aug. 13, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday raised its Covid-19 warning level for cruise ships to 4, the highest, and issued a blunt warning: “Avoid cruise travel regardless of vaccination status.” The move came as the number of outbreaks on ships has grown in recent weeks, causing some ports to turn away ships. Last week, dozens of people on a Royal Caribbean International ship tested positive after it set sail from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and a Carnival Cruise Line ship returned to Miami on Sunday after positive tests among “a small number on board.” Calling the C.D.C.’s decision “perplexing,” the cruise industry’s trade group, Cruise Lines International Association, said in a statement that the number of cases onboard made up a very slim minority of the total population and that “the majority of cases were asymptomatic or mild in nature, posing little to no burden on medical resources onboard or onshore.” Before the C.D.C.’s warning on Thursday, Royal Caribbean Group, one of the biggest cruise companies, said its ships had carried 1.1 million guests since it had restarted U.S. operations in June, with 1,745 people testing positive. While the majority of passengers had mild or no symptoms, 41 people were hospitalized. “Omicron is having a big short-term impact on everyone, but many observers see this as a major step towards Covid-19 becoming endemic rather than epidemic,” said Richard D. Fain, chairman and chief executive of Royal Caribbean Cruises. Despite the increase in cruise ship cases, Mexico’s government announced this week that it would let cruise ships dock at its ports even if passengers have tested positive for the coronavirus, and also allow asymptomatic travelers to disembark on its shores. The announcement came after two cruise ships with Covid outbreaks were refused permission by the authorities in Jalisco State in the last week to let passengers or crew disembark at Puerto Vallarta, a popular tourist destination on Mexico’s Pacific coast. “Our country maintains its policy of solidarity and fraternity, as well as the principle of non-discrimination towards all people,” the government said in a statement. “The health and tourism authorities remain attentive to provide the necessary medical assistance to those who visit us.” The coronavirus wreaked havoc on the cruise industry in the early stages of the pandemic, infecting hundreds of cruise passengers and workers and requiring the sector to shut down for 18 months. To begin sailing, cruise ships had to agree to the C.D.C.’s Conditional Sailing Order, which is valid until Jan. 15. On most cruises out of U.S. ports, almost all crew members and adult passengers are vaccinated and masks are required indoors except for when passengers are eating or drinking.  Among the safety measures the order requires — beyond submitting the daily number of coronavirus cases — is a prevention and control plan for each cruise ship.  Most cruise companies do not publicly announce the number of coronavirus cases identified during sailings, but all cruise ships operating to and from U.S. ports must submit daily numbers to the C.D.C., which uses a color-coded system to inform the public whether the number of cases is above or below the agency’s threshold for an investigation. Currently 88 cruise ships are being monitored by the C.D.C. because of reported coronavirus cases onboard. The agency does not publicly specify the number of cases on each ship. Some Covid infected, asymptomatic sailors from a ship docked at Guantánamo Bay with a coronavirus outbreak were removed from the ship and its environs before Christmas and put in quarantine in a base hotel, the Navy said Thursday. The Navy had previously reported that all the sailors had remained aboard the ship.  The U.S.S. Milwaukee arrived at Guantánamo Bay on Dec. 20 with a fully vaccinated crew of 105 sailors and Coast Guard members, some sick with the virus. It has been docked there since, as officials grapple with an outbreak among 25 percent of the crew.  None required hospitalization or medical evacuation from the remote base in southeast Cuba, Guantánamo health officials said, and those who did become sick experienced symptoms that were “mild in nature,” according to Cmdr. Kate Meadows, a spokeswoman for the Fourth Fleet in Jacksonville. Commander Meadows had earlier said that none of the sailors had left the ship or its immediate pier area since arriving at Guantánamo. Instead, she said crew members celebrated Christmas on the ship or in fresh air at the pier, segregated from the base, which has a mixed civilian and military population of about 6,000 residents, of whom about 900 are unvaccinated.  On Thursday, she clarified that some sailors who tested positive but were asymptomatic were moved to a hotel in the center of the base “due to limited berthing.”  She declined to say how many were moved but a Navy official, who was not authorized to be identified by name, elaborated that five sailors were moved ashore, so that the ship could strictly segregate the infected members on board from those who were Covid free. The sailors brought ashore were checked in “remotely” to a Navy run hotel, had no contact with staff and were placed in rooms with orange signs signifying the occupants were under quarantine, said the base spokeswoman, Nikki Maxwell. Navy health officials had yet to establish which variant of the virus had infected the sailors. “The sailors remaining with symptoms continue to only be mild in nature, again showing the importance of the vaccine and aggressive cleaning measures onboard,” Commander Meadows said. The U.S.S. Milwaukee departed its home port in Jacksonville, Fla., on Dec. 15 to undertake an anti-drug-trafficking mission under the direction of the U.S. Southern Command. The ship is expected to return to the mission in the new year. Airlines have been preparing for the holiday season for months, reviewing plans and readying reserves of workers. But that wasn’t enough to mitigate the effects of the fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus and of heavy snow and strong winds in the West. The impact continued to be felt on Thursday, with more than 1,200 cancellations of flights to, from or within the United States by afternoon, according to the air travel data site FlightAware. The site also showed more than 640 cancellations for Friday. The continued disruption comes as the country is averaging more than 260,000 new coronavirus cases a day, greater than the peak levels from last winter. Infection rates are especially high in parts of the Northeast and Midwest. Caseloads have continued to increase rapidly as the Omicron variant spreads, though deaths and hospitalizations have remained relatively steady.  The surge has disrupted far more than air travel. New York City has slowed to a crawl as the virus thins the ranks of subway workers and emergency personnel. Cincinnati declared a state of emergency on Wednesday to help the city deal with labor shortages within the city’s Fire Department amid a spike in coronavirus cases that coincided with scheduled holiday vacations. Many cities have canceled or limited New Year’s celebrations. More broadly, the pandemic has caused months of havoc in supply chains.  The air carriers hit hard on Thursday included JetBlue, with 17 percent of its total flights canceled. JetBlue said Wednesday that it was reducing its schedule through Jan. 13. In a statement, the airline said it had “seen a surge” in sick calls because of the Omicron variant, hampering its ability to staff its flights suitably even though it started the holidays with more workers than at any point since the pandemic began. “We expect the number of Covid cases in the Northeast — where most of our crew members are based — to continue to surge for the next week or two,” the company said. “This means there is a high likelihood of additional cancellations until case counts start to come down.” Alaska Airlines, whose primary hub is Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, canceled 14 percent of its flights. Relentless snowfall and record low temperatures in the Pacific Northwest grounded planes last week, and it snowed again in Seattle on Thursday. Looking to relieve its staffing squeeze, the airline industry pushed for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to shorten its recommended isolation period for Americans infected with Covid-19. The agency had previously recommended that infected patients isolate for 10 days after a positive test. But on Monday, it reduced that period to five days for those without symptoms and those without fevers whose other symptoms were resolving. Delta Air Lines was one of the first companies to adapt to the updated guidance. Its new policy, dated Tuesday, provides five days of paid leave for vaccinated workers who test positive for the coronavirus to isolate, according to an internal communication to company leaders obtained by The New York Times. The policy encourages, but does not require, a Covid test to go back to work — going a step further than the C.D.C. guidance, which does not include a recommendation for additional testing — and Delta is offering two additional days of paid time off for workers who test positive on Day 5. But the airline’s protocols make no mention of whether returning employees should have improving symptoms, as suggested by the C.D.C. Megabus, a long-distance bus operator, said Thursday that it is offering free rides on routes in the U.S. and Canada to travelers whose flights are canceled between Dec. 27 and Jan. 7.  Michigan health officials announced Thursday that the state will ignore new isolation guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pending “additional information.”  On Monday, the C.D.C. cut in half the recommended isolation period of 10 days for those with little or no symptoms. Those now leaving isolation should quarantine for five days and wear masks for an additional five days, federal health officials said.  In its statement, Michigan’s health department said it wanted to review the evidence behind the new isolation guidelines, including its application for high-risk groups, before it adopted the protocol.  Until then, the state “will retain current quarantine and isolation guidelines,” and have its residents follow the previous 10-day isolation period.  Health officials also expressed concern over a recent spike in cases across the state, thought to be the result of the new, and highly transmissible, Omicron variant. More than 9,000 people are testing positive every day in Michigan, a 40 percent jump over the last two weeks.  The new guidelines have divided health and government officials, who disagreed on whether or not they were necessary.  “The C.D.C. made a decision to balance what’s good for public health at the same time as keeping the society running,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said on News Nation’s “Morning in America” on Thursday.  Still, Dr. Fauci added, the new guidelines are not “100 percent risk-free.”  Others disagreed. The New York State Nurses Association issued its own statement on Dec. 24 in response to the new guidelines, calling the emergency guidance “potentially dangerous for health care workers and the communities we serve.”  “This guidance is inconsistent with proven science, vague, and doesn’t provide definitions or explain standards at a time when decision-making for health care systems is critical,” the organization said.  The Food and Drug Administration is planning to broaden eligibility for coronavirus vaccine booster doses on Monday, allowing 12- to 15-year-olds to receive third doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine, according to people familiar with the agency’s deliberations.  Regulators also plan to allow both adolescents and adults to seek an extra shot of Pfizer’s vaccine five months after receiving a second dose instead of the current period of six months. A booster shot is also expected to be authorized for younger children, ages 5 to 11, with immune deficiencies.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee is planning to meet by the middle of next week to vote on whether to recommend the changes. If the committee agrees with the F.D.A.’s authorizations, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, is expected to promptly endorse the revisions. The move to expand boosters comes as the highly contagious Omicron variant is infecting a record number of Americans with the coronavirus, putting more pressure on hospitals already deluged by Covid-19 patients from the Delta variant. More than 70 percent of people in the United States 12 years and older are fully vaccinated, according to the C.D.C. At least 1.8 million adolescents between 12 and 15 years old have tested positive for the virus, according to the C.D.C. Children can better withstand coronavirus infections, but in rare instances still can get very sick and even die.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released two studies on Thursday that underscored the importance of vaccinating children against the coronavirus. One study found that serious problems among children 5 to 11 who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were extremely rare. The other, which looked at hundreds of pediatric hospitalizations in six cities last summer, found that nearly all of the children who became seriously ill had not been fully vaccinated. More than eight million doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been given to children 5 to 11 in the United States so far. But concerns about the unknowns of a new vaccine caused some parents to hesitate in allowing their children to be inoculated, including those who said they preferred to wait for the broader rollout to bring any rare problems to the surface. By Dec. 19, roughly six weeks into the campaign to vaccinate 5- to 11-year-olds, the C.D.C. said that it had received very few reports of serious problems. The agency evaluated reports received from doctors and members of the public, as well as survey responses from the parents or guardians of roughly 43,000 children in that age group. Many of the surveyed children reported pain at the site of the shot, fatigue, or a headache, especially after the second dose. Roughly 13 percent of those surveyed reported a fever after the second shot. But reports of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle that has been linked in rare cases to coronavirus vaccines, remained scarce. The C.D.C. said there were 11 verified reports that had come in from doctors, vaccine manufacturers or other members of the public. Of those, seven children had recovered and four were recovering at the time of the report, the C.D.C. said. The C.D.C. said that reporting rates for vaccine-related myocarditis appeared highest among boys and men aged 12 to 29. A number of parents or doctors also reported instances of 5- to 11-year-olds receiving the incorrect, larger vaccine dose meant for older children and adults. The C.D.C. said that those problems were “not unexpected,” and that most such reports mentioned that the children experienced no problems afterward. The C.D.C. detailed two reports of deaths, in girls ages 5 and 6, who the agency said had chronic medical conditions and were in “fragile health” before their shots. “On initial review, no data were found that would suggest a causal association between death and vaccination,” the agency said. The C.D.C.’s separate report on pediatric hospitalizations provided additional evidence about the importance of vaccinating all eligible children. The study, which looked at more than 700 children under 18 who were admitted to hospitals with Covid-19 last summer, found that 0.4 percent of those children who were eligible for the shots had been fully vaccinated. The study also found that two-thirds of all the hospitalized children had a comorbidity, most often obesity, and that about one-third of children 5 and older were sick with more than one viral infection. Overall, nearly one-third of the children were so sick they had to be treated in intensive care units, and almost 15 percent needed medical ventilation. Among all those hospitalized, 1.5 percent of the children died, the study found. The six hospitals were in Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Texas and Washington, D.C. “This study demonstrates that unvaccinated children hospitalized for Covid-19 could experience severe disease and reinforces the importance of vaccination of all eligible children to provide individual protection and to protect those who are not yet eligible to be vaccinated,” the authors of the study wrote. Crowds at home games for professional sports teams in Ontario, Canada, including the Toronto Raptors and the Maple Leafs, will be pared to 1,000 spectators or fewer under public health measures announced Thursday by the province’s authorities as the Omicron variant continues to fuel a rise in coronavirus infections. Sporting events, concerts and theaters will be limited to either 1,000 attendees or 50 percent of their usual capacity, whichever was fewer. The restrictions will take effect Friday and apply to the Maple Leafs and Ottawa Senators of the N.H.L., the Raptors of the N.B.A., and lower-level teams. Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, the parent company of the Toronto teams, said in a statement Thursday that it would “transition to operating without sold tickets,” starting Friday. The company expected the attendance cap would be in place for at least three weeks, at which point the province would reassess the situation. The Raptors will not be selling tickets to the general public, but “will honor our commitments under N.B.A. rule — so essentially family, friends, opposing team tickets,” Jennifer Quinn, the director of communications for the Raptors, said in an email. The N.H.L. last week decided to begin its scheduled holiday break early as the virus spread within its teams. After one game on Dec. 21, play didn’t resume until Tuesday. Even after its return, the league on Tuesday postponed a game because of virus issues, and postponed another nine games involving Canadian teams affected by attendance regulations, hoping they could host larger contingents of fans at a later date. Quinn said the Raptors and the N.B.A. had not discussed postponing games because of the capacity restrictions. The Raptors have six home games within the next three weeks. The N.B.A. has postponed 11 games this season, including three Raptors games, when at least one competing team did not have enough available players in part because of virus outbreaks. Ontario’s latest protocols further reduced capacity after earlier this month it cut the figure to 50 percent, or about 10,000 spectators, for the Maple Leafs, Senators and Raptors. Ontario is averaging nearly 10,000 cases per day, up 515 percent from two weeks ago. As the Omicron variant sweeps across the planet, the global tally of new coronavirus cases has for the first time passed one million per day on average. The previous global case record set last April has already been broken three times this week. The United States, Canada and much of Western Europe are leading the surge, with both regions seeing record-breaking levels of new coronavirus cases. The daily average number of new cases in the United States on Tuesday was more than 267,000, exceeding the previous all-time peak set in January; Wednesday’s average was higher still, at more than 300,000. New cases in at least 11 European countries — Britain, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Spain and Switzerland — also passed their previous all-time peaks on Tuesday or Wednesday. In France, the daily case average passed 100,000. Cases in Canada have also seen a steep increase in recent days, more than doubling in a week to an average of more than 25,000. And Australia’s cases climbed to an average of more than 12,600 on Wednesday — eight times higher than just three weeks earlier. Britain’s National Health Service “is now on a war footing,” one of its top medical officials warned on Thursday, saying its hospitals would erect field wards to help deal with the surge in coronavirus cases that has produced a steep rise in hospitalizations nationally. Health experts were bracing for more challenges in the coming weeks that would further strain the system, which is besieged by the absences of tens of thousands of health care workers who are sick themselves, or isolating. Officials also cautioned that absences could have a far-reaching impact on public services like transportation. Coronavirus cases in Britain reached new highs this week, driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant, with 183,037 cases reported across the country on Wednesday — twice the highest daily count recorded in previous waves. More than 10,000 people with the coronavirus were hospitalized in England on Wednesday, the highest number since March, though it is still unclear how many were hospitalized for illness caused by the virus and how many were there for another reason but also tested positive. On Thursday, the National Health Service outlined plans for new field hospitals in England in response to the wave of Omicron cases. These temporary facilities, called “Nightingale hubs,” will be capable of housing around 100 patients each, the health service said in a statement, and would be set up at eight hospitals across the country. “We do not yet know exactly how many of those who catch the virus will need hospital treatment,” Stephen Powis, the medical director of Britain’s National Health Service, said in a statement. “But given the number of infections we cannot wait to find out before we act and so work is beginning from today to ensure these facilities are in place.” JERUSALEM — Israel on Thursday approved a fourth dose of Covid vaccine for people with weakened immune systems, moving ahead of much of the world in taking a little-studied step to try to protect its most vulnerable against the fast-spreading Omicron variant. The decision by health officials came more than a week after an advisory panel of Israeli experts recommended a fourth dose for people with weak immune systems, as well as for others at high risk, including those aged 60 and over and health workers.  The panel had acknowledged the uncertainties and lack of data surrounding both Omicron and the fourth dose, but presented data indicating a significant waning of immunity in people aged 60 or older, who were the first to receive their third shots starting in August. At a news conference on Thursday evening, Prof. Nachman Ash, the director-general of Israel’s Ministry of Health, said the advisory panel’s recommendation had been partially accepted, and a fourth dose would be offered to those whose immune systems have been compromised by illness or treatments they are undergoing. “Given the gaps of knowledge that exist around the world regarding the efficiency of a fourth dose in the current circumstances, we are acting cautiously and responsibly,” Professor Ash said. He said Israeli health officials would continue to monitor the effects of Omicron in Israel and abroad, including the risk of severe illness in people who are already vaccinated, before taking any decision to broaden the rollout of a fourth dose for other vulnerable people, including the older population. Weighing the potential benefits of another booster shot against the risks, some scientists, including a few on the Israeli advisory panel, have voiced concern that too many vaccinations might cause a sort of immune system fatigue, compromising the body’s ability to fight the coronavirus, particularly among older people. The Sheba Medical Center, near Tel Aviv, began a study on Monday to test the safety and effectiveness of a fourth dose of a vaccine, administering an additional shot to 150 medical personnel who had received a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least four months ago. After Thursday’s announcement, officials there said the hospital would start administering fourth doses to heart transplant patients on Friday morning.  Developments in Israel, an early leader in Covid vaccinations, are being closely watched as governments worldwide struggle to confront the rapidly spreading Omicron variant, which is driving record numbers of new infections in parts of the United States, Europe and many other places. Israel was the first country to roll out third shots as boosters for the population at large, putting it in position to assess earlier than other countries how effective the shots are and how quickly the protection might wear off. Even as some studies suggest that Omicron infections are milder than those caused by other variants, the surges are already stretching health systems. Israel’s hospitals have already filled up with patients suffering from complications of winter flu and other respiratory ailments.  At least half the new daily cases in Israel are now believed to be from Omicron, and experts say that variant is likely to surpass Delta as the dominant variant in the country within a couple of weeks. Over four million Israelis have received a booster shot, out of a total population of nine million, but about a million eligible Israelis have not. In November, Israel became one of the first countries after the United States to approve Covid vaccinations for children aged 5 to 11, but the initial uptake in that age group has been slow. On Thursday, Israel received its first shipment of Pfizer’s coronavirus drug. Known as Paxlovid, it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week for Covid patients age 12 and over who are vulnerable to becoming severely ill because of their age or prior medical conditions. Crowds will return to Times Square on Friday for the annual ball drop, despite the surge in Covid-19 cases in New York City and across the country, but one notable act will not be there: the rapper LL Cool J, who announced he had tested positive for Covid on Wednesday. The singer Chloe Bailey also canceled on Wednesday, although she did not explain why. Several other musical acts are slated to perform, including KT Tunstall, Karol G and Journey.  Mayor Bill de Blasio announced last week that although New Year’s Eve celebrations would be scaled back somewhat this year, the ball drop would go on. Last year, only a small number of frontline workers and their families were allowed to attend. Although the public will be welcome once more to Times Square, revelers may want to think twice about watching the ball drop in person this year. New York City’s seven-day average test positivity rate was about 15 percent on Tuesday, according to the state. The event will also draw people from places around the country and the world with varying rates of Covid cases and vaccination. The celebrations will kick off at 6 p.m. in Times Square. Visitors won’t be allowed into the viewing areas until 3 p.m., hours later than in past years. Millions of rapid at-home Covid tests are flying off pharmacy shelves across the United States, giving Americans an instant, if sometimes imperfect, read on whether they are infected with the coronavirus. But the results are rarely reported to public health departments, exacerbating the longstanding challenges of maintaining an accurate count of cases at a time when the number of infections is surging because of the Omicron variant. At the minimum, the widespread availability of at-home tests is wreaking havoc with the accuracy of official positivity rates and case counts. At the other extreme, it is one factor making some public health experts raise a question that once would have been unthinkable: Do counts of coronavirus cases serve a useful purpose, and if not, should they be continued? “Our entire approach to the pandemic has been case-based surveillance: We have to count every case, and that’s just not accurate anymore,” said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, a national nonprofit organization representing public health agencies in the United States. “It’s just becoming a time where we’ve got to think about doing things differently.” British scientists announced on Thursday that a new study will find out if increasing the dosage of a cheap and readily available steroid can help patients with extremely severe cases of Covid-19. Dexamethasone became an unexpected sign of hope early on in the pandemic when scientists discovered that its use could save the lives of severely ill coronavirus patients. By reducing inflammation caused by the virus, and therefore stopping an immune reaction that could kill those infected, one estimate found that, had Britain implemented it earlier, 5,000 more people would still be alive. In a trial, scheduled to take place in the next few months, those with low oxygen levels will be administered the higher dosage. Instead of the standard six milligrams patients began receiving in June 2020, those in the new trial will receive more than double that: 20 milligrams for the first five days, followed by 10 for the remainder of the treatment. Scientists hope the higher quantity will reduce hospital stays, avoid the use of ventilators and prevent deaths. The same researchers who discovered the drug’s initial effectiveness are launching this new study, which will begin in a few months, because of an anticipated spike in hospitalizations, following a surge of coronavirus cases. Both the United States and a handful of European nations are shattering daily case records brought on largely by the highly contagious variant. Within weeks of its discovery in the U.S., more than 59 percent of new coronavirus cases in the country are now linked to Omicron. “Given how quickly the Omicron variant is spreading, we can expect to see patients admitted to hospital with severe Covid-19 for a while to come,” Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the University of Oxford, said in a statement. “This makes it very important that we continue to explore ways to further improve the care of patients with severe Covid-19.” Citigroup has expanded remote working for its U.S. employees as a surge in coronavirus cases disrupts Wall Street’s return-to-office plans. Again.“We are asking that you work from home for the first few weeks of the new year if you are able to do so,” Citigroup said in a memo to staff on Thursday. “We will continue to monitor the data and provide an update in January on when we expect to be back in the office.” Citigroup’s new guidance applies to employees in more than 30 offices around the country who had been called back since September. Employees in New York City and New Jersey were already given the option to work from home in the final weeks of the year.JPMorgan Chase gave employees more flexibility to work from home in the first two weeks of January, but expects them to return to in-office schedules no later than Feb. 1, according to a memo to employees.“We are not changing our long-term plans of working in the office,” the bank’s operating committee said in the memo. The company may also amend its policy on vaccinations, which it has not required so far.“Government-issued vaccine mandates may likely make it difficult or impossible for us to continue to employ unvaccinated employees, so getting the vaccine is very important,” the memo said. The bank may soon require a booster shot for people entering its buildings. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has prompted big Wall Street companies, which have been eager to bring workers back, to press pause on those plans. Wells Fargo postponed its return to the office, while corporate employees at Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank were given more leeway to work remotely over the holidays. Goldman Sachs has bucked the trend. The investment bank, which called most workers back to the office in June, will require a booster for all employees eligible to receive one beginning Feb. 1, and it will require staff to be tested for the virus twice a week at on-site testing centers starting Jan. 10. Currently, employees in the office must get tested once a week. CHICAGO — Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois urged hospitals on Thursday to postpone nonemergency surgeries as the state seeks to preserve bed availability in the face of record numbers of new cases. “We’re asking our residents to temporarily hold off on important medical care like tonsillectomies, bariatric surgeries and hernia repair,” Mr. Pritzker, a Democrat, said in a statement, adding that he expected the case surge to continue into the new year.  Like in much of the country, cases in Illinois are spiking as the highly infectious Omicron variant takes hold. The state is averaging more than 16,000 new cases a day, compared to about 4,400 daily at the start of December. Around 4,600 Illinoisans with the virus are hospitalized, up 35 percent over the last two weeks but still well below the peak levels seen last winter. Early data suggests that Omicron causes milder illness than previous forms of the virus. Though businesses remain open, the virus has encroached on daily life in Illinois in increasingly obvious ways. Chicago residents are lining up on chilly sidewalks outside storefront testing centers. Several colleges have announced that they will begin the new academic term with online classes. Driver’s license offices will close next week because of rising infection levels. And earlier Thursday, the state’s lieutenant governor, Juliana Stratton, said that she had tested positive. Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the state’s public health director, warned in a statement about health care worker shortages and growing fatigue among doctors and nurses. Case rates are especially high around Champaign, Chicago and Peoria. “We are currently seeing approximately 500 new admissions a day to Illinois hospitals due to Covid-19, and approximately 90 percent of those are unvaccinated,” Dr. Ezike said, adding that “we’re seeing health care workers leave the profession because they are burned out after watching people suffer severe illness and even death for almost two years now.” Unlike the rest of the Midwest, Illinois continues to have a statewide mask mandate. And starting Monday, people in Chicago hoping to eat indoors or go to gyms will have to prove that they are vaccinated.  Still, much of daily life continues even as the virus data worsens. Chicago Public Schools students are scheduled to return to class on Monday. And a New Year’s Eve fireworks display along the Chicago waterfront is expected to go ahead, with watch parties planned at several downtown businesses.

The program kept clients engaged for a few months through video conferences and over-the-phone services. When leaders prepared to invite a small group of the Community for All Day Habilitation Program participants back in person, they wanted to ensure their safety. “That was a huge challenge, and we had to really become creative,” said La’Kisha Alvarado, the program director. To meet social distancing requirements, the program, part of Brooklyn Community Services, had to decrease the number of participants transported on each of the three buses it uses, and make extra trips if needed. It offset the costs with money from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which has Brooklyn Community Services as one of its nine beneficiary agencies. Ms. Alvarado said that the safety protocols helped reassure families about their loved ones’ health, and that clients were excited to see one another and the staff members in person again. “They were more than happy to come back,” Ms. Alvarado said. This year, some beneficiary organizations also turned their attention to helping distribute Covid-19 vaccines. In February, one of those groups, Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, offered a pop-up vaccination event at the Betances Houses​​​ in partnership with the Bronx Rising Initiative and the Morris Heights Health Center. Since then, the organization has continued to help with pop-up vaccine sites throughout the city, mainly at affordable housing sites connected with Catholic Charities and local parishes. Catholic Charities works with the Community Healthcare Network, which secures and distributes the vaccines. Richard Espinal, the director of housing support services and parish and community engagement, has been overseeing the effort. “I’m almost like the carnival barker, letting folks know that we’re here and they can come get vaccinated,” Mr. Espinal said. Much of his work involves answering questions and encouraging people to get vaccinated. “We’re dealing with a community and a population that has a lot of underlying health conditions,” he said. Because of disparities in health care, he tries to be there to reassure New Yorkers. Children’s Aid, another beneficiary agency, has also been working to bolster vaccinations in New York. Through a partnership with the NYC Health + Hospitals, the organization has provided testing and vaccine distribution across the city. And UJA-Federation of New York, which is also supported by The Neediest Cases Fund, ran pop-up vaccine clinics and helped match social service agencies, schools and community centers with vaccine providers for appointments, resulting in thousands of vaccination appointments, including some for Holocaust survivors. UJA-Federation also made grants to organizations to foster vaccine education and to increase access, particularly in minority communities hit hardest by the pandemic. In Coney Island, Brooklyn Community Services is also working to improve vaccine equity and awareness by answering questions in front of its community centers and at train stations, where staff members hand out fliers and help people sign up to get vaccinated. Around the world, the International Rescue Committee, another beneficiary agency, has been working to protect people in refugee camps against Covid-19. “The most important thing is that we really need to meet people where they are,” said Mesfin Teklu Tessema, the senior technical director and head of the health unit at the organization. “The way to do it is through outreach, breaking the language barrier that exists, making the information easily understandable.” With financial support from The Neediest Cases Fund, the organization has been working to ensure that health care workers in Bidi Bidi refugee camp in northern Uganda have adequate personal protection equipment. Money has also been used to deliver vaccines to reach elderly Rohingya refugees in remote areas of the Cox’s Bazar camp in Bangladesh. To support children feeling the strain of the pandemic, First Book, another beneficiary agency of The Neediest Cases Fund, has drawn on its social and emotional learning materials. First Book, which provides free and inexpensive books to children in need, assisted Rebecca Brinkman when much of her third-grade class returned to in-person school in March. One of the first things Ms. Brinkman noticed was how anxious her students were. Online learning had been challenging, especially because many of her students didn’t have reliable access to the internet. Back in the classroom, her students told her that they had fears about being there and that they were nervous they’d fallen behind. “It felt like, honestly, being in an alternate reality,” said Ms. Brinkman, 37, who has been an educator at the Cartwright School District in Phoenix for 15 years. In early 2020, Ms. Brinkman had learned of First Book and had received a $150 grant to buy books and coloring books from the organization, which she distributed to her students and used to read aloud during remote school. She turned to First Book again this year for books like “Breathe Like a Bear,” by Kira Willey, which teaches children mindfulness exercises. And she used the group’s Trauma Toolkit, a downloadable resource to help teachers support students. “I wish that everyone knew about First Book, because it’s been nothing but helpful,” she said. World Central Kitchen, another Neediest Cases Fund beneficiary group, has been providing meals this year to health care workers at vaccination sites across the country. “The past couple of years have really shown us how vulnerable so many communities are,” said Fiona Donovan, the relief operations manager at World Central Kitchen. Recently, the organization supplied meals for health care workers at vaccination sites run by Children’s National Hospital in Washington and in Lanham, Md. Since the clinics were vaccinating children, the organization often brought fruit and cookies to pass out as a treat. “So long as funding is available and there’s a need,” Ms. Donovan said, “we’re going to do what we can.”"

As a third year of the pandemic loomed, the seven-day average of U.S. cases topped 267,000 on Tuesday, according to a New York Times database. The milestone was marked after a year that has whipsawed Americans from a relaxation of rules in the spring to a Delta-driven summer wave to another surge that accelerated with astonishing speed as Omicron emerged after Thanksgiving. The record came only a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reduced the number of days that many infected Americans should remain isolated to five days from 10. The C.D.C. changed course as Omicron’s rapid spread has worsened a labor shortage, upending the hospitality, medical and travel industries, among others. The agency did not recommend rapid testing before people left isolation, and experts warned that that omission risked seeding new cases and heaping even more pressure on already overburdened health systems. The previous U.S. daily cases record was set on Jan. 11, when the seven-day average was 251,232. That was during a catastrophic winter that was far worse than this moment, when over 62 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated. And early evidence, including some hopeful reports from South Africa, suggests that Omicron causes milder symptoms than other variants, with vaccinations and boosters helping prevent serious illness and death. Hospitalizations have been rising, averaging more than 71,000 a day, but remain far below peak levels. While deaths have also been increasing, the daily average of 1,243 is a fraction of the record 3,342 reported on Jan. 26. Nevertheless, Omicron has a considerably easier time than Delta infecting vaccinated people. The coming cascade of patients threatens to overwhelm hospitals just as health care workers themselves are increasingly infected. A sizable number of patients remain infected with the deadlier Delta variant. On Tuesday, the C.D.C. reported that Omicron cases made up a significantly lower percentage of the overall U.S. caseload than was expected, at roughly 59 percent. And for the week ending Dec. 18, the agency revised down its estimate of 73 percent to about 23 percent, meaning Delta remained dominant until last week. Omicron is undoubtedly becoming the dominant variant, and that could be good news: A new laboratory study carried out by South African scientists showed that people who had recovered from an infection with the variant might be able to fend off later infections from Delta. Records are also being broken in Europe, but so far, the leaders of Britain, France, Spain and some other countries have resisted imposing harsh new restrictions amid calls from some who argue that it is time to accept that the virus is endemic and that countries should move away from lockdowns. These nations, confronted with Covid fatigue, are betting for now that high vaccine and booster coverage, along with earlier restrictions still in place, will be enough to keep the coronavirus manageable. The United States has also taken a similar path, as President Biden has repeatedly said that the era of lockdowns is over and promised to increase testing, double down on vaccination campaigns and prop up hospitals. But public health experts have warned that the measures will not be sufficient to prevent soaring infections and hospitalizations over the next few weeks. And demand for tests has exploded while manufacturers are scrambling to increase production and distribution. Testing is central to New York City’s plan to keep the largest U.S. school district open in the new year. The city announced on Tuesday that it would eliminate its policy of quarantining entire classrooms exposed to the coronavirus, and would instead use a ramped-up testing program to allow students who test negative and do not have symptoms to remain in school. Omicron is hitting the Mid-Atlantic States especially hard. Washington, Maryland and Virginia all broke records on Monday for daily case counts. “D.C. is a marker for what we’re likely to see in much of the rest of the country,” said Neil J. Sehgal, an assistant professor of health policy at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Health. “A tidal wave in Omicron cases is likely to flood much of the country in the next month.” Coronavirus positivity rates have surged in the Washington, D.C., region, urged on by the Omicron variant, which has steadily gained dominance in the United States throughout the holiday season. Washington, Maryland and Virginia all broke records on Monday in reporting their highest case counts of the pandemic. Washington reported almost 1,000 percent more new cases over the past two weeks and more than 9,000 new cases since Dec. 24. Maryland’s seven-day average for daily new cases stands at more than double the previous high recorded almost a year ago, in January. “The road to get through the next three or four weeks is going to be very rough,” said Earl Stoddard, the assistant chief administrative officer for Montgomery County, Md., which borders Washington. “There are going to be an absolute ton more cases. The hope is that we’re not going to see those necessarily reflected in hospitalizations that will lead to severe complications and or death.” Virginia reported more than 18,000 new cases over the Christmas weekend, with Fairfax and Arlington counties showing that positive cases had quadrupled over the past two weeks. None of the positive test counts reported in the region included at-home tests, meaning that the number of infected individuals was likely even higher. Neil J. Sehgal, a professor of health policy at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Health, said that despite high vaccination rates in the region, the Omicron variant was likely tearing through the population, which includes a large number of adults 20 to 49 who socialize and travel during the holiday season. “We’re seeing a bit of a holiday party phenomenon, I think,” Mr. Sehgal said. “People aged 20 to 49 are more transmission efficient — they’re more likely to infect people once they have been infected themselves.” Hospitalizations are ticking up, with more than 1,500 people having been hospitalized with Covid-19 in Maryland as of Dec. 23. While deaths have remained at about the same level over the past two weeks in most of the region, the number often lags behind the number of positive case rates by two to three weeks. And Maryland is juggling other issues, including a hack on Dec. 4 that has prevented the state from reporting county-level data on Covid-19 cases and shortages of emergency medical workers and hospital staff as they test positive. “We’ve got beds here, but we don’t have the nurses to staff those beds,” said Marc Elrich, Montgomery County’s executive. “You feel like the circle is closing in around you after a while.” The region is also struggling to keep up with demands for testing. In Northern Virginia, pharmacies that sell at-home Covid tests and libraries that had been handing out free kits have put up signs at their entrances telling people they have run out. Local news reported mass confusion among Maryland residents about testing locations and lines of hundreds of cars in the days after Christmas. The surge, which is expected to continue into the new year, has already upended a return to school for college students. George Washington University canceled in-person classes until late January and Howard University has pushed back the start of its spring semester. Mr. Stoddard said that public schools in Montgomery County were keen on ramping up testing in order to prevent further disruption to students. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that the Omicron variant now accounts for roughly 59 percent of all Covid cases in the United States, a significant decrease from the agency’s previous estimate. The update shows how hard it is to track the fast-spreading variant in real time and how poorly the agency has communicated its uncertainty, experts said. Last week, the C.D.C. said that Omicron accounted for approximately 73 percent of variants circulating in the United States in the week ending Dec. 18. But in its revision, the agency said the variant accounted for about 23 percent of cases that week. In other words, Delta, which has dominated U.S. infections since summer, still reigned in the United States that week. That could mean that a significant number of current Covid hospitalizations were driven by infections from Delta, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, suggested on Twitter. Hospitalizations typically lag several weeks behind initial infections. Experts said they were not surprised by the revisions, given that the C.D.C.’s estimates are rough guesses, with a wide range of possible values known as “confidence intervals.” Cases of Omicron can only be confirmed by genetic sequencing, which is performed on just a portion of samples across the country. And Omicron is still spreading extremely fast. Still, they said the C.D.C. did a poor job communicating the uncertainty of its estimates. The agency has had a series of missteps during the pandemic, including sending out botched tests early on and shifting guidance on masking. On Monday, when it halved the recommended isolation period to five days for those who test positive but show no symptoms, critics objected that there was no requirement to test before returning to work. Dr. Jerome Adams, who served as the U.S. surgeon general under former President Donald J. Trump, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday that while he respected the C.D.C., he disagreed with its decision on isolation periods. He also criticized the new guidance’s lack of a test-out option or recommendation for higher-quality masks. David O’Connor, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said of the Omicron estimate, “The 73 percent got a lot more attention than the confidence intervals, and I think this is one example among many where scientists are trying to project an air of confidence about what’s going to happen.” Dr. O’Connor said he initially thought the initial estimate “seemed high.” The agency came up with the estimate based on a “relatively small number of sequences,” he added. “It’s like playing Name That Tune, and trying to say, based on just the first note, if the song is ’Ice Ice Baby’ by Vanilla Ice, or ‘Under Pressure,’” Dr. O’Connor said. “Without more data, it can be really hard to know which one it’s going to be.” The new estimate of 59 percent is also a rough calculation, experts said, and will most likely be revised in future weeks. “I just want people to be very aware that that is an estimate, that’s not actually from sequence-confirmed cases,” said Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health. “With Omicron in particular, it’s been very difficult to have any sort of projections, because things are changing just so so rapidly.” Dr. Grubaugh, who is tracking probable Omicron samples in Connecticut, said that the variant makes up more than 80 percent of cases there, though he also notes that the country is heterogenous and the variant likely has a different prevalence in different places. “I don’t know how the C.D.C. built their algorithm, but human beings made these programs, and humans are fallible,” said Massimo Caputi, a molecular virologist at the Florida Atlantic University School of Medicine. “At the end of the day you can predict as much as you want but you need to look at the numbers you have in your hand.” Dr. O’Connor, who is tracking Omicron in Wisconsin, said the variant made up half of cases on the University of Wisconsin–Madison campus in just three days. “If I was making a betting prediction, it wasn’t so much that the number 73 percent was wrong, but the timing to get there was wrong,” he said. These predictions will likely become more accurate over time as more data on Omicron is collected. More precise numbers will be needed to smartly distribute Covid treatments. One of the great challenges of Omicron is the variant’s ability to thwart two of the three monoclonal antibody treatments, which can prevent serious illness in Covid-19 patients. As such, some hospitals have begun scaling back these treatments; administrators at NewYork-Presbyterian, N.Y.U. Langone and Mount Sinai all said they would stop giving patients the two treatments that are ineffective against Omicron. But the drugs could still help people infected with Delta. “If you still have those Delta cases, discontinuing monoclonals means all those people who would have benefited from them won’t be receiving them at all,” Dr. O’Connor said. Dr. O’Connor said scientists and health care providers need to do a better job of communicating the uncertainty in the predications they share with the public. “Having the humility to acknowledge that there’s a lot that no one knows and is unknowable right now is going to be really important.” The decision by federal health officials to shorten isolation periods for Americans infected with the coronavirus drew both tempered support and intense opposition from scientists on Tuesday. One of the main points of contention was the absence of a testing requirement and fears that the omission could hasten the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant. The new guidance, coming amid a crush of new infections that has starved many hospitals of workers, seemed to some scientists like a necessary step to shore up work forces in essential industries. And encouraging people to leave isolation early after testing negative could spare them the hardships of prolonged periods at home. But letting hundreds of thousands of infected people forgo those tests — even if, crucially, their symptoms were not entirely gone — risks seeding new cases and heaping even more pressure on already overburdened health systems, experts said in interviews on Tuesday. “To me, this feels honestly more about economics than about the science,” said Yonatan Grad, an associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who has tracked coronavirus infections in the National Basketball Association. Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview on Tuesday that the new guidance had been necessitated by the volume of people about to be infected. The C.D.C.’s recommendations cut isolation periods for infected people from 10 days to five. The agency did not recommend rapid testing before people left isolation, but asked infected people to wear a mask around others for five days. But some scientists maintain that rapid tests are the most convenient indication of whether or not someone remains contagious. Regulatory delays, manufacturing problems and shortfalls in government support have left rapid tests in extremely short supply as the Omicron variant has surged, pushing caseloads to near record levels in the United States. New York City, home to the nation’s largest school system, will eliminate its current policy of quarantining entire classrooms exposed to Covid, and will instead use a ramped-up testing program to allow students who test negative for the coronavirus and do not have symptoms to remain in school. The new policy, which Mayor Bill de Blasio referred to as “Stay Safe and Stay Open” during his announcement on Tuesday, will take effect on Jan. 3, when the nearly one million students who attend the city’s public schools are scheduled to return from holiday break. More than 27,000 new virus cases were reported in New York City on Tuesday, and more than 2,300 people were hospitalized with Covid-19, according to the state’s most recent count. Mr. de Blasio, Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor-elect Eric Adams, who takes office on Saturday, appeared together at a news conference to present a united front against school closures, despite an enormous surge in cases driven by the Omicron variant that has only worsened in the days since city schools closed for winter break last week. “Your children are safer in school, the numbers speak for themselves,” Mr. Adams said. Instead of delaying the start of in-person school and pivoting to remote learning, the city will double the amount of random surveillance testing it conducts, in hopes of detecting more infections while mitigating disruptions.  Many school districts have sought to limit disruption and prevent outbreaks by increasing testing. That model, known as “test to stay,” was endorsed by the C.D.C. earlier this month. States including Illinois, Kansas, California and Massachusetts have test-to-stay strategies, and the United Kingdom loosened quarantine rules for exposed students earlier this year.  In the Granite School District near Salt Lake City, a significantly smaller school district than New York’s made up of 90 schools and 63,000 students, the test-to-stay program has worked well, according to the district’s spokesman, Ben Horsley, and is now being adopted in Utah statewide.  In New York City, hundreds of classrooms were either entirely closed or partially closed last week because of Covid exposures. The city’s previous policy was to quarantine unvaccinated close contacts of infected students for 10 days. Many elementary school children in particular have not been vaccinated, even though they are eligible, and fewer than half of all city children aged 5 to 17 are fully vaccinated. City officials are expecting Omicron to continue surging in New York over the next few weeks, which will certainly be felt in classrooms. To avoid frequent closures and disruption, the city will provide students with rapid at-home tests to take if someone in their classroom tests positive.  If the students are not showing symptoms and test negative, they will be allowed to return the next day. They will then be given a second at-home test within five days of their exposure. Students or parents will self-report test results to schools.  Students will also receive rapid tests if their classmates or teachers are displaying symptoms. Those who test positive will have to quarantine for 10 days.  New York still plans to close entire schools when there is evidence of major in-school spread. People who have recovered from an infection with the new Omicron coronavirus variant may be able to fend off later infections from the Delta variant, according to a new laboratory study carried out by South African scientists. If further experiments confirm these findings, they could suggest a less dire future for the pandemic. In the short term, Omicron is expected to create a surge of cases that will put a massive strain on economies and health care systems around the world. But in the longer term, the new research suggests that an Omicron-dominated world might experience fewer hospitalizations and deaths than one in which Delta continues to rage. “Omicron is likely to push Delta out,” said Alex Sigal, a virologist at the Africa Health Research Institute in Durban, South Africa, who led the new study. “Maybe pushing Delta out is actually a good thing, and we’re looking at something we can live with more easily.” He posted the new study on the institute’s website on Monday. It has not yet been published in a scientific journal. Independent scientists said that the results of the South African experiment, though preliminary, were sound. Carl Pearson, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the findings were consistent with what is now happening in England. “Omicron arrives and grows rapidly, and the Delta trend switches to declining,” he said. And Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, said he was observing the same pattern in Connecticut. “We are seeing Omicron exponentially rise while Delta cases are falling,” he said. “This suggests to me that Omicron is outcompeting Delta for susceptible individuals, leaving them less susceptible to Delta in the aftermath, and driving down Delta cases.” When people began getting infected with the coronavirus two years ago, they produced antibodies and immune cells that could provide protection against it. As a result, it was very rare for a person to be reinfected in the months that followed. But starting in late 2020, new coronavirus variants emerged. Some of them, like Alpha, had mutations enabling them to spread rapidly. Others, like Beta, had adaptations that allowed them to evade antibodies — whether they were produced during a prior infection or in response to a Covid-19 vaccine. As the highly contagious Omicron variant sends U.S. case rates higher, a stream of colleges and universities around the country have announced that classes will be delayed or will begin remotely in January. For some students, the revised plans are a decidedly unwelcome development following almost two years of online instruction, limited gatherings, testing protocols and uncertainty. At Syracuse University, David Bruen, the student body president, said he supported the university’s decision to delay its start by one week, to Jan. 24, despite his feelings of disappointment.  “I’m someone who really believes in what’s best for public health,” said Mr. Bruen, 20, a political science major. “But the fact that this keeps going on is just frustrating and stressful and sad.” The decisions, made after consulting experts who said that transmission of the virus will likely surge after the holiday break, were not universal. Some major colleges, including the University of Michigan and Northeastern University, stood firm, stating that classes would begin as usual, even as the schools imposed a booster requirement. But broadly, fears are rising that campus life in 2022 could be a repeat of 2020. In some cases, students were advised, it would be best to remain at home for a while, if possible. Others announced new requirements that students receive booster shots and wear KN95 masks. The University of Miami said late Wednesday that it would start with remote-only classes on Jan. 18 amid surging cases of in South Florida. In-person classes are expected to resume on Jan. 31, an email to students and faculty said. Howard University in Washington, D.C., tweeted on Monday that it had seen a “concerning increase in percentage and the number of positive cases over the past three weeks,” delaying the start of its semester to Jan. 18.  Also on Monday, Princeton University said it would begin classes as scheduled on Jan. 24, but delayed the return of students by one week to Jan. 14, with students arriving gradually over 10 days. The university also said it would ban travel by students outside the campus vicinity until mid-February.  In Houston, Rice University sent a message to students Sunday announcing the delay of in-person classes until Jan. 24. The university said it was strongly encouraging students not to arrive on campus until the weekend of Jan. 22.  On Dec. 21, New York University posted an announcement that January classes would be held online. So did Columbia. Both schools advised faculty and staff to work remotely.  Binghamton University and the University of Illinois announced one-week delays in the start of classes. Wayne State University in Detroit announced that classes would be held online for at least three weeks and imposed a booster shot requirement. Ka Yee C. Lee, the University of Chicago provost, announced a one-week delay and then two weeks of remote instruction until Jan. 24. Undergraduates living in residence halls were strongly encouraged to delay their return to campus until at least Jan. 20. In California, some schools were moving classes online and others were imposing new vaccine requirements. Seven schools in the University of California system, including U.C.L.A., announced that classes would be remote for the first two weeks of the quarter. Other schools said they were either delaying in-person classes for one week or evaluating possible changes. And the University of Pennsylvania moved classes online for two weeks and delayed campus housing move in. Days before the United States had its first confirmed case of the Omicron variant on Dec. 1 in California, health officials in Nebraska began looking into six probable cases of coronavirus infection in one household, among them a 48-year-old unvaccinated man who had recently returned from a conference in Nigeria. On Dec. 2, the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory identified the Omicron variant as the cause in all six people, who ranged in age from 11 to 48. A study of the group released on Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that Omicron may have a shorter incubation period than previous variants: about 72 hours. It may take as little as three days for people to develop symptoms, become contagious and test positive, compared with four to six days with Delta infections and those caused by original coronavirus, the authors observed. Only one member of the household was fully vaccinated, and all but one member, including the traveler, had experienced confirmed infections in 2020. No household members reported underlying medical conditions. The study also reported that the family members experienced mild symptoms. The six described their illnesses as similar to, or milder than, those experienced during their first infection. “It is unknown whether the mild clinical syndromes or differing symptom descriptions are a result of existing immunity or altered clinical features associated with Omicron infection,” the study’s authors wrote. “The five reinfections, including one after full vaccination, might be explained by waning immunity, the potential for partial immune evasion by Omicron, or both.” A study in Norway that examined a large cluster of individuals who were infected with the variant at a Christmas party in Oslo also suggested that the incubation period was around three days. It is not yet clear how long people remain infectious with Omicron. Quebec, which is fighting the highest infection levels in Canada, announced on Tuesday that health care workers in the province who test positive for the coronavirus will continue working under certain circumstances. All essential workers in the province, including those who work in medicine, will be subject to the new rules, Christian Dubé, Quebec’s minister of health and social services, said in a news briefing. He said that workers who test positive will keep working “according to a list of priority and risk management.” He did not provide details but said more information would be released in the coming days. During previous waves, Mr. Dubé said, the goal had been to “identify and remove at-risk employees as quickly as possible.” But given the highly contagious nature of the Omicron variant, and so many people being infected and having to be pulled out of work, he said, “we have to do otherwise. We have no choice.” The average number of new cases per day in Quebec has risen 376 percent in the past two weeks, and the seven-day average of new daily cases in the province is over 8,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That number makes up more than half of Canada’s new cases every day, on average. The strain on health care workers around the world has been building since the beginning of the pandemic, and experts have warned that they are nearing a breaking point. In October, the World Health Organization estimated that more than 100,000 health care workers had died of Covid and urged countries to do more to protect them. In the United States, some states called in the National Guard this month to help run hospitals and nursing homes that have been hit hard by staff shortages and illness among their employees. Hugh Jackman, who is starring as Professor Harold Hill in “The Music Man” at the Winter Garden Theater on Broadway, announced on Tuesday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. “I just wanted you to hear from me that I tested positive this morning for Covid,” Jackman said in an Instagram video. “My symptoms are like a cold: I have a scratchy throat and a bit of a runny nose, but I’m fine. And I’m just going to do everything I can to get better, A.S.A.P., and as soon as I’m cleared, I’ll be back onstage.” Shortly after Mr. Jackman posted his video, “The Music Man” announced on Instagram that all performances would be canceled through Saturday. Tickets can be refunded or exchanged where they were purchased. Performances will resume on Sunday, and Mr. Jackman will return to the show on Jan. 6.  Several other Tony winners star in “The Music Man” alongside Mr. Jackman: Sutton Foster as Marian Paroo, Shuler Hensley as Marcellus Washburn, Jefferson Mays as Mayor Shinn, Jayne Houdyshell as Mrs. Shinn and Marie Mullen as Mrs. Paroo. Preview performances for “The Music Man” began on Dec. 20, with opening night scheduled for Feb. 10. While “The Music Man” has managed to stay open, other shows have not. The New York City Ballet announced Tuesday that it was canceling its remaining performances of “The Nutcracker.”  The producers of “Ain’t Too Proud,” a jukebox musical about the Temptations, also announced on Tuesday that their show will close on Jan. 16. The show has not run since Dec. 15, citing coronavirus cases. It is planning to resume on Tuesday, Dec. 28, and hoping to run for three more weeks before closing for good.  Last week, the musicals “Jagged Little Pill” and “Waitress,” as well as the play “Thoughts of a Colored Man” announced that they had closed without so much as a farewell performance — all were already on hiatus because of coronavirus cases among cast or crew. The efforts of “The Music Man” to stay open had just been highlighted on Thursday night, when the actress Kathy Voytko, a swing and an understudy for Marian Paroo in the musical, filled in for Ms. Foster, who had Covid, at the last minute. After the show, the actress and dancer Katherine Winter posted an Instagram video of Mr. Jackman praising understudies and swings as “the bedrock of Broadway.” “Kathy, when she turned up at work at 12 o’clock, could have played any of eight roles,” Jackman said at the curtain call. “It happened to be the leading lady. She found out at 12 noon today, and at 1 o’clock she had her very first rehearsal as Marian Paroo.” As the coronavirus and its Omicron variant spread, understudies and swings are becoming more important than ever: Shows are relying on them to step in for sick or unavailable leads. “This is unprecedented,” Mr. Jackman continued. “It’s not only happening here at the Winter Garden, but all over Broadway. This is a time we’ve never known.” The Omicron variant is blazing around the world with such speed that even the leader of Israel, one of the most highly vaccinated countries, warned on Tuesday that it cannot be stopped. “We can’t prevent it,” Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said, in blunt comments that reflected a growing consensus in nations where Omicron has caught fire: The virus is moving too fast to catch. That daunting notion — backed up by data from nations where Omicron is spreading rapidly only a month after it was first detected — is tempered by early evidence that the variant causes milder symptoms, with vaccinations and boosters helping prevent serious illness and death. Many experts worldwide have expressed concern that the sheer number of people who are likely to be infected could create a flood of patients, overwhelming already stressed health care systems. But that is running up against those who argue that it is time to accept that the virus is endemic, and that countries should move away from lockdowns and toward laxer rules including shorter quarantines. John Bell, a professor of medicine at Oxford University and an adviser to the British government, said that Omicron was “not the same disease we were seeing a year ago.” “The horrific scenes that we saw a year ago of intensive care units being full, lots of people dying prematurely, that is now history, in my view, and I think we should be reassured that that’s likely to continue,” he told the BBC on Tuesday. While the latest figures in Britain are incomplete because of the Christmas holiday, data published on Monday indicated that more than 300,000 new Covid cases had been recorded between Saturday and Monday. But Chris Hopson, the head of N.H.S. Providers, the membership organization for England’s health staff, said that while hospitalizations across Britain had risen, it was not a precipitous jump. “What’s very interesting is how many are talking about number of asymptomatic patients being admitted to hospital for other reasons and then testing positive for Covid,” he said of conversations with heads of hospitals, in a series of posts on Twitter. “Some are describing this as ‘incidental Covid.’” Britain appears to be a few weeks ahead of most other nations in the world in confronting the first wave of Omicron infection and, for the moment, has decided that the evidence does not warrant new restrictions. But the United Kingdom is hardly united in how to respond to the moment. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all started new curbs this week to slow the spread of Omicron, largely focusing on reducing indoor mixing. Across Europe, divisions can be seen in how to respond to what Prime Minister Jean Castex of France on Monday called a “film without ending.” His country is seeing a record number of cases, putting extra pressure on intensive care units in public hospitals. All the tools the world has grown familiar with over the past two years — lockdowns, passes proving vaccination status, limits on private gatherings, mask mandates, social distancing — are being deployed to different degrees across the continent. And pushback continues to build. On Monday night, thousands of people took to the streets of Germany to protest new measures under which all nightclubs will be closed, private meetings of more than 10 people will be banned and further restrictions will be put in place on movie theaters and cultural and sporting events.   The N.F.L. and the N.F.L. Players Association on Tuesday night amended this season’s Covid-19 protocols to mirror new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, halving the amount of time players who test positive for the coronavirus need to isolate regardless of their vaccination status. In a memo sent to all 32 of the league’s teams, Commissioner Roger Goodell said players infected with the coronavirus — whether vaccinated or unvaccinated — now need to quarantine for only five days, not 10, if their symptoms improve, after the C.D.C. revised its recommendation on Monday. Factors listed in the memo include whether the player’s fever subsided after 24 hours without medication, if their cough improved, and if team and league medical officials determine the player can return to the facility. The new protocols have drastic implications for the N.F.L., which has struggled to contain a surge of coronavirus cases as the playoffs approach. More than 94 percent of the N.F.L.’s players are vaccinated. Vaccinated players could clear protocols if they had two negative tests 24 hours apart, but positive tests for unvaccinated players normally led to their missing at least one game under previous rules, and the revised guidelines allow for them to potentially return to the field more quickly. The amendments follow a string of changes that the N.F.L. put in place this month regarding Covid-19 requirements. After previously testing vaccinated players weekly, the league and the players’ union agreed nearly two weeks ago to test them only when they are considered close contacts or show symptoms. It also mandated that essential staff who interact with players receive booster shots. Asymptomatic vaccinated players can also “test out” of protocols and return to play as soon as 24 hours after a positive test if they are no longer deemed contagious. But Tuesday’s memo is the first modification of protocols for the unvaccinated, who all season have been subject to stiffer requirements than their inoculated teammates. They are tested daily and must take separate planes to away games, among other things. The changes come after more than 90 players tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday, nearly one week after the N.F.L. rescheduled three games because of virus outbreaks fueled by the Omicron variant. The United States is averaging over 240,000 cases per day, and the memo recommended that all players and staff avoid social gatherings, bars and restaurants. In the last off-season, the N.F.L. mandated vaccinations for coaches and essential personnel, saying those who refused would be unable to interact with players. The league stopped short of requiring vaccinations for players, but strongly incentivized it by subjecting players who were not inoculated to stricter protocols. Demonstrations against Covid rules across Germany on Monday, featuring thousands of marchers, underscored the growing frustration as states prepare to introduce tighter regulations and lawmakers look to introduce mandatory vaccinations.  Rallies on Mondays have had special resonance in Germany since weekly demonstration walks on that day helped bring down the Berlin Wall in 1989. In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a northeastern state, about 15,000 marchers took part in protests in several cities, according to police estimates. On Monday, the state closed nightclubs, banned private meetings of more than 10 people and placed further restrictions on movie theaters and on cultural and sporting events. Other states imposed similar restrictions on Tuesday as part of an agreement with the federal government to counter an expected rise in infections from the Omicron variant. Those measures will add to rules targeting particularly the unvaccinated that were introduced as case numbers in Germany rose in the fall. In Bautzen, a town in the eastern state of Saxony, protesters attacked the police with bottles and fireworks when officers tried to stop a demonstration on Monday, the force said on Twitter. While most of the rallies occurred in eastern Germany, some sizable demonstrations took place in cities in the west as well. In Saarbrücken and Fulda, in the central state of Hesse, about 1,000 marched. In Wolfsburg, in the northern state of Lower Saxony, 800 turned out. As Germany braces for Omicron, lawmakers plan to discuss a general vaccine mandate in the opening parliamentary session of 2022. A vaccine requirement for medical workers and care facility employees passed this month and will go into effect in mid-March. After a renewed emphasis on the national vaccine drive, which included a task force led by an army general, 71 percent of the German population is fully vaccinated and around 44 percent of adults have received a booster shot. But vaccination rates in some states in the east of the country are significantly lower. In Saxony, only 63 percent of the population is fully vaccinated. The country’s constitutional court also ruled on Tuesday that legislation should be introduced to protect disabled people when hospital resources are stretched. The decision was in response to a suit brought by disability activists more than a year ago and aims to guard against discrimination in triage decisions should hospitals become overwhelmed. At the moment, hospital admission rates are actually declining in Germany, but during a wave of infections in November, medical centers in some hot spots were forced to transfer patients to other regions to relieve pressure on I.C.U. staff. A lengthy doctors’ strike in New Delhi against staffing shortages at state-run hospitals has crippled health services, creating fears of disaster if the Omicron variant overwhelms medical facilities. Medical students from across India have joined the protests, which intensified two weeks ago and have grown angrier after police officers were seen beating junior doctors during a march on Monday.  The New Delhi government has expressed concern over a rising number of coronavirus cases and announced new measures, including a nighttime curfew, to slow the spread of the virus. While the country’s overall case count remains low, daily infections in the capital region have risen by more than 300 percent over the past two weeks, according to the Our World in Data Project at the University of Oxford. It is unclear how many of the new cases are of the Omicron variant. As the doctors’ strike has stretched on, drawing in recent graduates and tens of thousands of the more than 70,000 doctors who work at government medical facilities nationwide, emergency health services have been the worst hit.  Videos from major state-run hospitals in New Delhi have shown patients on stretchers lying unattended outside emergency rooms. Many Indians rely on state medical facilities for care because of the high cost of treatment at private hospitals. The protests were triggered by delays in placing medical school graduates in jobs at government health facilities, as India’s Supreme Court considers an affirmative action policy aimed at increasing the share of positions reserved for underrepresented communities. Protesting doctors say they are not against the quotas, but want the court to expedite its decision so that graduates can begin their jobs. During India’s catastrophic coronavirus wave earlier this year, doctors and other medical personnel found themselves short-handed and underfunded as they battled an outbreak that at its height was causing 4,000 deaths a day. Doctors associations say that more than 1,500 doctors have died from Covid since the pandemic began. Protests continued across the country and outside major hospitals in New Delhi on Tuesday, a day after police officers in the capital detained more than 2,500 protesting doctors who were walking toward the residence of India’s health minister. India’s health ministry said it was saddened over the treatment of doctors during the protest on Monday, but said it could not proceed with job placements while the issue was being heard in the country’s top court. Dr. Suvrankar Datta, an official for the Federation of All India Medical Association, a doctors’ group that supports the strike, said as coronavirus cases rise in New Delhi and other parts of the country, there will not be enough doctors to handle the crisis. “We have already communicated to the government so many times that the health care infrastructure is understaffed like never before,” he said. If graduates are not placed in jobs quickly, he added, it creates “a completely catastrophic situation when cases rise.” Beaches that normally spring back to life for cold-water plunges on Jan. 1 may remain deserted, as annual New Year’s Day fund-raising swims have become yet another casualty of the Omicron variant. The swims are a quirky tradition in many Western countries, requiring participants to enter frigid waters to raise money for charity. But the emergence of Omicron — the highly transmissible variant that is now fueling record surges around the world — has shuttered a range of cultural institutions, from New Year’s Eve celebrations to Broadway shows. And now, largely because of Omicron, some of the world’s most daring — and charitable — swimmers will be kept out of the waters on New Year’s Day. The status of the charity swims are a reflection of the world’s patchwork approach to Covid restrictions. For some organizers, the cancellations were a yes-or-no decision, while others were inching toward Jan. 1 with contingency plans if the Covid situation worsened. Many of the North American events are still on, though some will have Covid guidelines. At Coney Island in New York, the New Year’s Day Plunge was set to go on as planned. But at one Seattle event, swimmers must wear masks and have a booster shot. In Canada, a slate of events have been canceled in Ontario and in British Columbia. But participants in Vancouver and Oakville, Ontario, could still take a “digital dip” by sending a picture of themselves in a snowbank or a kiddie pool. Swim events on Achill Island in Ireland and in the The Hague were canceled. But in County Wicklow, Ireland, and Catalonia, Spain, charity swims were tentatively moving forward. In the United Kingdom, where the charity swims are a beloved remedy after New Year’s Eve revelries, events were on in North Yorkshire, England, but off in Edinburgh, Scotland, and in Pembrokeshire, Wales, among other places. “We are deeply disappointed,” the organizers of the Tenby Boxing Day Swim in Wales said. “Covid wins again.” Almost four weeks ago, in an apparent fit of optimism, the N.C.A.A. approved the creation of a 42nd bowl game so that every eligible football team with an even record or better would have a postseason game. Never mind that the calendar already overflowed with bowls. The late birth of the one-time Frisco Football Classic set up the Miami (Ohio) Redhawks to play North Texas. It was fortunate the game was contested when it was: By the time the Redhawks won, 27-14, two days before Christmas, the bowl season had fallen into chaos. That day, Texas A&M withdrew from the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Fla., temporarily leaving Wake Forest without an opponent. Miami — the one in Florida — was warning that its participation in the Sun Bowl was in doubt because of the virus. And the College Football Playoff said its four teams risked forfeiting if they were not ready to play on time. The situation has only worsened since, as more outbreaks have led to more withdrawals and more reshuffling. All told, games have been canceled or reimagined from Honolulu to Boston, and it is anyone’s guess how many more will be affected by the time a national champion is crowned on Jan. 10 in Indianapolis — if, in fact, one is crowned. “It’s just déjà vu all over again of what we had last year,” Greg McGarity, the Gator Bowl’s chief executive, said in an interview on Tuesday. “The weird thing was, when the bowls were announced on Dec. 5, Covid wasn’t even a factor.” “Everybody thought that we were over the hump as far as that goes,” he continued, “and then Omicron hit and here we are again.” Even though the Omicron variant has produced a worrisome increase in hospitalizations among children in the United States, experts said that a combination of factors, including low vaccination rates, was the most likely explanation. Doctors and researchers said they were not seeing evidence that Omicron was more threatening to children. Instead, much of the rise in pediatric admissions results from the sheer number of children who are becoming infected with both Delta and the more contagious Omicron variant, experts said, as well as low vaccination rates among children over 5. “I think the important story to tell here is that severity is way down and the risk for significant severe disease seems to be lower,” said Dr. David Rubin, a researcher at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Preliminary data suggests that compared with the Delta variant, Omicron appears to be causing milder illness in children, similar to early findings for adults. That data, however, has not alleviated anxiety among parents nationwide, as caseloads in children have risen in several states. A number of states have reported increases of about 50 percent in pediatric admissions for Covid-19 in December. New York City has experienced the most significant rise, with 68 children hospitalized last week, a fourfold jump from two weeks earlier. Children overall are somewhat less protected from the virus than adults. Younger children do not yet qualify for vaccination, and only those age 16 and older qualify for booster shots, which offer the most effective shield against infection and hospitalization. In the week ending Dec. 23, about 199,000 childhood cases were reported nationally, a 50 percent increase compared with the beginning of December, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Roughly one in 10 American children has tested positive for the virus since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the academy. Infected children remain far less likely to become ill, compared with adults. But across the country last week, an average of 1,200 children each day have been hospitalized with the coronavirus, up from 800 at the end of November, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. (Some of those children arrived at the hospital with other medical issues.) Those numbers are well below the peaks reached last September, although experts also fear a wave of pediatric hospitalizations in the coming weeks, fueled by Omicron’s spread, holiday gatherings and a return to classrooms after Jan. 1. “We’re just holding our breath and bracing for a tsunami of impact,” said Dr. Patricia Manning, the chief of staff at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. A Delta Air Lines flight that was en route from Seattle to Shanghai turned back in midair last week because the Chinese airport had imposed new cleaning rules that would have caused delays, the airline said in a statement on Tuesday. “The new cleaning procedures require significantly extended ground time and are not operationally viable for Delta,” the airline said. Details of the new cleaning regulations in place at Shanghai Pudong International Airport were not immediately clear, but China has rolled out increasingly strict Covid-19 travel rules amid a growing outbreak in the northern city of Xian and before the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February. The scrapped flight left passengers with out-of-date Covid-19 test results and expired U.S. visas, according to Chinese news reports. The Chinese Consulate in San Francisco, which did not name Delta, said in a statement that it “had made a stern representation to the airline.” The new sanitation protocols also led EVA Air of Taiwan to suspend passenger services to Shanghai Pudong from the cities of Taipei and Kaohsiung until Feb. 3, Taiwan’s semiofficial Central News Agency reported. Another Taiwan-based carrier, China Airlines, is suspending flights from one city to Shanghai until the end of January and reducing flights on another route, according to news reports. The Chinese Embassy in the United States said in a statement that reports that the Delta plane had been turned around because of a ban on incoming flights were incorrect. Many domestic and international flights in the United States had been canceled because of staff shortages, the embassy noted, adding that it was “communicating with relevant airlines to actively understand the specific technical issues and discuss solutions to avoid similar incidents from happening again.” The outbreak in Xian remains small by global standards. On Tuesday, Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid in China, said that the city of 13 million people, where the local authorities last week imposed a lockdown, had reported 175 cases in one day, its highest daily count since the outbreak began this month. In total, 810 cases have been recorded in Xian. As the Omicron variant drives positivity rates to their highest levels of the pandemic in many parts of the world, major cities have scaled down or canceled New Year’s Eve events for a second consecutive year. Only months ago, expanding Covid vaccinations and loosening travel rules had promised a return of raucous New Year gatherings amid hopes that the pandemic might finally be waning. But the emergence of Omicron — the highly transmissible variant that is now dominant in the United States and fueling record surges in many nations — has prompted governments to reinstate travel restrictions, mask mandates and bans on large gatherings. Even as early studies suggest that Omicron produces less severe illness, experts warn that the staggering caseload could still overwhelm health systems. A number of Dec. 31 events have been canceled in countries where caseloads are rising swiftly, including in Italy, where the 14-day average of new cases is up 128 percent, and in France, where cases are up by 48 percent, according to the Our World in Data Project at the University of Oxford. In the United States, where daily cases have doubled over the past two weeks, some events have been canceled, but the annual celebration in Times Square in New York will go on, with attendance capped at 15,000. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, recommended on Monday that people “stay away” from large New Year’s Eve parties, especially when it is not clear who has been vaccinated. Speaking on CNN, Dr. Fauci said, “There will be other years to do that, but not this year.” As another 12 months living with the pandemic draws to a close, here’s a look at how Omicron has forced some cities to change their plans for Dec. 31: Last week, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a downsizing of the celebration in Times Square to at most 15,000 guests, nearly a quarter of the usual amount, who will be allowed in at 3 p.m. at the earliest. Attendees will be required to wear masks and show proof of full vaccination. Fox canceled its “New Year’s Eve Toast & Roast 2022” live broadcast from Times Square. The network said in a statement that “the recent velocity of the spread of Omicron cases has made it impossible to produce a live special in Times Square that meets our standards.” Several Los Angeles County holiday events have been canceled, including the New Year’s countdown in Grand Park, which will now be streamed. For the second year in a row, there will be no crowds allowed at the Space Needle’s fireworks show. People can watch on a livestream instead. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, announced last week that the New Year’s Eve event in Trafalgar Square was canceled, saying: “The safety of Londoners must come first.” Paris has canceled its celebration, which was to include fireworks over the Champs-Élysées. Prime Minister Jean Castex also announced that large public parties would be banned on New Year’s Eve. Celebrations have been scrapped in several Italian cities, including Rome and Venice. Outdoor events have been banned and nightclubs will be closed for the month of January. Berlin’s annual New Year’s Eve party at the Brandenburg Gate will go on, but without any audience members. The performances will be live on television. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has also announced that gatherings will be limited to a maximum of 10 people starting Dec. 28. Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo typically attracts tens of thousands of people for one of the biggest New Year celebrations in the world. This year, like last year, the revelry has been called off. Public drinking has been banned in Shibuya on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority has banned all social, political and cultural gatherings, including Christmas and New Year celebrations, according to The Economic Times newspaper. Restaurants and bars are allowed to operate only at half capacity. Cape Town is still allowing New Year’s Eve gatherings, but several restrictions are in place. There is a curfew from 12 a.m. to 4 a.m., masks are required in public areas and nightclubs are closed. The authorities banned New Year’s Eve celebrations throughout the country, including in Casablanca, Morocco’s most populous city. Restaurants will close 30 minutes before midnight, and there will be a curfew from midnight to 6 a.m. The national police force on Monday announced a ban on New Year’s Eve fireworks across the country, including in Kampala, Uganda’s capital. Nighttime religious services will also be prohibited."

As a third year of the pandemic loomed, the seven-day average of U.S. cases topped 267,000 on Tuesday, according to a New York Times database. The milestone was marked after a year that has whipsawed Americans from a relaxation of rules in the spring to a Delta-driven summer wave to another surge that accelerated with astonishing speed as Omicron emerged after Thanksgiving. The record came only a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reduced the number of days that many infected Americans should remain isolated to five days from 10. The C.D.C. changed course as Omicron’s rapid spread has worsened a labor shortage, upending the hospitality, medical and travel industries, among others. The agency did not recommend rapid testing before people left isolation, and experts warned that that omission risked seeding new cases and heaping even more pressure on already overburdened health systems. The previous U.S. daily cases record was set on Jan. 11, when the seven-day average was 251,232. That was during a catastrophic winter that was far worse than this moment, when over 62 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated. And early evidence, including some hopeful reports from South Africa, suggests that Omicron causes milder symptoms than other variants, with vaccinations and boosters helping prevent serious illness and death. Hospitalizations have been rising, averaging more than 71,000 a day, but remain far below peak levels. While deaths have also been increasing, the daily average of 1,243 is a fraction of the record 3,342 reported on Jan. 26. Nevertheless, Omicron has a considerably easier time than Delta infecting vaccinated people. The coming cascade of patients threatens to overwhelm hospitals just as health care workers themselves are increasingly infected. A sizable number of patients remain infected with the deadlier Delta variant. On Tuesday, the C.D.C. reported that Omicron cases made up a significantly lower percentage of the overall U.S. caseload than was expected, at roughly 59 percent. And for the week ending Dec. 18, the agency revised down its estimate of 73 percent to about 23 percent, meaning Delta remained dominant until last week. Omicron is undoubtedly becoming the dominant variant, and that could be good news: A new laboratory study carried out by South African scientists showed that people who had recovered from an infection with the variant might be able to fend off later infections from Delta. Records are also being broken in Europe, but so far, the leaders of Britain, France, Spain and some other countries have resisted imposing harsh new restrictions amid calls from some who argue that it is time to accept that the virus is endemic and that countries should move away from lockdowns. These nations, confronted with Covid fatigue, are betting for now that high vaccine and booster coverage, along with earlier restrictions still in place, will be enough to keep the coronavirus manageable. The United States has also taken a similar path, as President Biden has repeatedly said that the era of lockdowns is over and promised to increase testing, double down on vaccination campaigns and prop up hospitals. But public health experts have warned that the measures will not be sufficient to prevent soaring infections and hospitalizations over the next few weeks. And demand for tests has exploded while manufacturers are scrambling to increase production and distribution. Testing is central to New York City’s plan to keep the largest U.S. school district open in the new year. The city announced on Tuesday that it would eliminate its policy of quarantining entire classrooms exposed to the coronavirus, and would instead use a ramped-up testing program to allow students who test negative and do not have symptoms to remain in school. Omicron is hitting the Mid-Atlantic States especially hard. Washington, Maryland and Virginia all broke records on Monday for daily case counts. “D.C. is a marker for what we’re likely to see in much of the rest of the country,” said Neil J. Sehgal, an assistant professor of health policy at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Health. “A tidal wave in Omicron cases is likely to flood much of the country in the next month.” Coronavirus positivity rates have surged in the Washington, D.C., region, urged on by the Omicron variant, which has steadily gained dominance in the United States throughout the holiday season. Washington, Maryland and Virginia all broke records on Monday in reporting their highest case counts of the pandemic. Washington reported almost 1,000 percent more new cases over the past two weeks and more than 9,000 new cases since Dec. 24. Maryland’s seven-day average for daily new cases stands at more than double the previous high recorded almost a year ago, in January. “The road to get through the next three or four weeks is going to be very rough,” said Earl Stoddard, the assistant chief administrative officer for Montgomery County, Md., which borders Washington. “There are going to be an absolute ton more cases. The hope is that we’re not going to see those necessarily reflected in hospitalizations that will lead to severe complications and or death.” Virginia reported more than 18,000 new cases over the Christmas weekend, with Fairfax and Arlington counties showing that positive cases had quadrupled over the past two weeks. None of the positive test counts reported in the region included at-home tests, meaning that the number of infected individuals was likely even higher. Neil J. Sehgal, a professor of health policy at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Health, said that despite high vaccination rates in the region, the Omicron variant was likely tearing through the population, which includes a large number of adults 20 to 49 who socialize and travel during the holiday season. “We’re seeing a bit of a holiday party phenomenon, I think,” Mr. Sehgal said. “People aged 20 to 49 are more transmission efficient — they’re more likely to infect people once they have been infected themselves.” Hospitalizations are ticking up, with more than 1,500 people having been hospitalized with Covid-19 in Maryland as of Dec. 23. While deaths have remained at about the same level over the past two weeks in most of the region, the number often lags behind the number of positive case rates by two to three weeks. And Maryland is juggling other issues, including a hack on Dec. 4 that has prevented the state from reporting county-level data on Covid-19 cases and shortages of emergency medical workers and hospital staff as they test positive. “We’ve got beds here, but we don’t have the nurses to staff those beds,” said Marc Elrich, Montgomery County’s executive. “You feel like the circle is closing in around you after a while.” The region is also struggling to keep up with demands for testing. In Northern Virginia, pharmacies that sell at-home Covid tests and libraries that had been handing out free kits have put up signs at their entrances telling people they have run out. Local news reported mass confusion among Maryland residents about testing locations and lines of hundreds of cars in the days after Christmas. The surge, which is expected to continue into the new year, has already upended a return to school for college students. George Washington University canceled in-person classes until late January and Howard University has pushed back the start of its spring semester. Mr. Stoddard said that public schools in Montgomery County were keen on ramping up testing in order to prevent further disruption to students. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that the Omicron variant now accounts for roughly 59 percent of all Covid cases in the United States, a significant decrease from the agency’s previous estimate. The update shows how hard it is to track the fast-spreading variant in real time and how poorly the agency has communicated its uncertainty, experts said. Last week, the C.D.C. said that Omicron accounted for approximately 73 percent of variants circulating in the United States in the week ending Dec. 18. But in its revision, the agency said the variant accounted for about 23 percent of cases that week. In other words, Delta, which has dominated U.S. infections since summer, still reigned in the United States that week. That could mean that a significant number of current Covid hospitalizations were driven by infections from Delta, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, suggested on Twitter. Hospitalizations typically lag several weeks behind initial infections. Experts said they were not surprised by the revisions, given that the C.D.C.’s estimates are rough guesses, with a wide range of possible values known as “confidence intervals.” Cases of Omicron can only be confirmed by genetic sequencing, which is performed on just a portion of samples across the country. And Omicron is still spreading extremely fast. Still, they said the C.D.C. did a poor job communicating the uncertainty of its estimates. The agency has had a series of missteps during the pandemic, including sending out botched tests early on and shifting guidance on masking. On Monday, when it halved the recommended isolation period to five days for those who test positive but show no symptoms, critics objected that there was no requirement to test before returning to work. Dr. Jerome Adams, who served as the U.S. surgeon general under former President Donald J. Trump, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday that while he respected the C.D.C., he disagreed with its decision on isolation periods. He also criticized the new guidance’s lack of a test-out option or recommendation for higher-quality masks. David O’Connor, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said of the Omicron estimate, “The 73 percent got a lot more attention than the confidence intervals, and I think this is one example among many where scientists are trying to project an air of confidence about what’s going to happen.” Dr. O’Connor said he initially thought the initial estimate “seemed high.” The agency came up with the estimate based on a “relatively small number of sequences,” he added. “It’s like playing Name That Tune, and trying to say, based on just the first note, if the song is ’Ice Ice Baby’ by Vanilla Ice, or ‘Under Pressure,’” Dr. O’Connor said. “Without more data, it can be really hard to know which one it’s going to be.” The new estimate of 59 percent is also a rough calculation, experts said, and will most likely be revised in future weeks. “I just want people to be very aware that that is an estimate, that’s not actually from sequence-confirmed cases,” said Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health. “With Omicron in particular, it’s been very difficult to have any sort of projections, because things are changing just so so rapidly.” Dr. Grubaugh, who is tracking probable Omicron samples in Connecticut, said that the variant makes up more than 80 percent of cases there, though he also notes that the country is heterogenous and the variant likely has a different prevalence in different places. “I don’t know how the C.D.C. built their algorithm, but human beings made these programs, and humans are fallible,” said Massimo Caputi, a molecular virologist at the Florida Atlantic University School of Medicine. “At the end of the day you can predict as much as you want but you need to look at the numbers you have in your hand.” Dr. O’Connor, who is tracking Omicron in Wisconsin, said the variant made up half of cases on the University of Wisconsin–Madison campus in just three days. “If I was making a betting prediction, it wasn’t so much that the number 73 percent was wrong, but the timing to get there was wrong,” he said. These predictions will likely become more accurate over time as more data on Omicron is collected. More precise numbers will be needed to smartly distribute Covid treatments. One of the great challenges of Omicron is the variant’s ability to thwart two of the three monoclonal antibody treatments, which can prevent serious illness in Covid-19 patients. As such, some hospitals have begun scaling back these treatments; administrators at NewYork-Presbyterian, N.Y.U. Langone and Mount Sinai all said they would stop giving patients the two treatments that are ineffective against Omicron. But the drugs could still help people infected with Delta. “If you still have those Delta cases, discontinuing monoclonals means all those people who would have benefited from them won’t be receiving them at all,” Dr. O’Connor said. Dr. O’Connor said scientists and health care providers need to do a better job of communicating the uncertainty in the predications they share with the public. “Having the humility to acknowledge that there’s a lot that no one knows and is unknowable right now is going to be really important.” The decision by federal health officials to shorten isolation periods for Americans infected with the coronavirus drew both tempered support and intense opposition from scientists on Tuesday. One of the main points of contention was the absence of a testing requirement and fears that the omission could hasten the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant. The new guidance, coming amid a crush of new infections that has starved many hospitals of workers, seemed to some scientists like a necessary step to shore up work forces in essential industries. And encouraging people to leave isolation early after testing negative could spare them the hardships of prolonged periods at home. But letting hundreds of thousands of infected people forgo those tests — even if, crucially, their symptoms were not entirely gone — risks seeding new cases and heaping even more pressure on already overburdened health systems, experts said in interviews on Tuesday. “To me, this feels honestly more about economics than about the science,” said Yonatan Grad, an associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who has tracked coronavirus infections in the National Basketball Association. Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview on Tuesday that the new guidance had been necessitated by the volume of people about to be infected. The C.D.C.’s recommendations cut isolation periods for infected people from 10 days to five. The agency did not recommend rapid testing before people left isolation, but asked infected people to wear a mask around others for five days. But some scientists maintain that rapid tests are the most convenient indication of whether or not someone remains contagious. Regulatory delays, manufacturing problems and shortfalls in government support have left rapid tests in extremely short supply as the Omicron variant has surged, pushing caseloads to near record levels in the United States. New York City, home to the nation’s largest school system, will eliminate its current policy of quarantining entire classrooms exposed to Covid, and will instead use a ramped-up testing program to allow students who test negative for the coronavirus and do not have symptoms to remain in school. The new policy, which Mayor Bill de Blasio referred to as “Stay Safe and Stay Open” during his announcement on Tuesday, will take effect on Jan. 3, when the nearly one million students who attend the city’s public schools are scheduled to return from holiday break. More than 27,000 new virus cases were reported in New York City on Tuesday, and more than 2,300 people were hospitalized with Covid-19, according to the state’s most recent count. Mr. de Blasio, Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor-elect Eric Adams, who takes office on Saturday, appeared together at a news conference to present a united front against school closures, despite an enormous surge in cases driven by the Omicron variant that has only worsened in the days since city schools closed for winter break last week. “Your children are safer in school, the numbers speak for themselves,” Mr. Adams said. Instead of delaying the start of in-person school and pivoting to remote learning, the city will double the amount of random surveillance testing it conducts, in hopes of detecting more infections while mitigating disruptions.  Many school districts have sought to limit disruption and prevent outbreaks by increasing testing. That model, known as “test to stay,” was endorsed by the C.D.C. earlier this month. States including Illinois, Kansas, California and Massachusetts have test-to-stay strategies, and the United Kingdom loosened quarantine rules for exposed students earlier this year.  In the Granite School District near Salt Lake City, a significantly smaller school district than New York’s made up of 90 schools and 63,000 students, the test-to-stay program has worked well, according to the district’s spokesman, Ben Horsley, and is now being adopted in Utah statewide.  In New York City, hundreds of classrooms were either entirely closed or partially closed last week because of Covid exposures. The city’s previous policy was to quarantine unvaccinated close contacts of infected students for 10 days. Many elementary school children in particular have not been vaccinated, even though they are eligible, and fewer than half of all city children aged 5 to 17 are fully vaccinated. City officials are expecting Omicron to continue surging in New York over the next few weeks, which will certainly be felt in classrooms. To avoid frequent closures and disruption, the city will provide students with rapid at-home tests to take if someone in their classroom tests positive.  If the students are not showing symptoms and test negative, they will be allowed to return the next day. They will then be given a second at-home test within five days of their exposure. Students or parents will self-report test results to schools.  Students will also receive rapid tests if their classmates or teachers are displaying symptoms. Those who test positive will have to quarantine for 10 days.  New York still plans to close entire schools when there is evidence of major in-school spread. People who have recovered from an infection with the new Omicron coronavirus variant may be able to fend off later infections from the Delta variant, according to a new laboratory study carried out by South African scientists. If further experiments confirm these findings, they could suggest a less dire future for the pandemic. In the short term, Omicron is expected to create a surge of cases that will put a massive strain on economies and health care systems around the world. But in the longer term, the new research suggests that an Omicron-dominated world might experience fewer hospitalizations and deaths than one in which Delta continues to rage. “Omicron is likely to push Delta out,” said Alex Sigal, a virologist at the Africa Health Research Institute in Durban, South Africa, who led the new study. “Maybe pushing Delta out is actually a good thing, and we’re looking at something we can live with more easily.” He posted the new study on the institute’s website on Monday. It has not yet been published in a scientific journal. Independent scientists said that the results of the South African experiment, though preliminary, were sound. Carl Pearson, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the findings were consistent with what is now happening in England. “Omicron arrives and grows rapidly, and the Delta trend switches to declining,” he said. And Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, said he was observing the same pattern in Connecticut. “We are seeing Omicron exponentially rise while Delta cases are falling,” he said. “This suggests to me that Omicron is outcompeting Delta for susceptible individuals, leaving them less susceptible to Delta in the aftermath, and driving down Delta cases.” When people began getting infected with the coronavirus two years ago, they produced antibodies and immune cells that could provide protection against it. As a result, it was very rare for a person to be reinfected in the months that followed. But starting in late 2020, new coronavirus variants emerged. Some of them, like Alpha, had mutations enabling them to spread rapidly. Others, like Beta, had adaptations that allowed them to evade antibodies — whether they were produced during a prior infection or in response to a Covid-19 vaccine. As the highly contagious Omicron variant sends U.S. case rates higher, a stream of colleges and universities around the country have announced that classes will be delayed or will begin remotely in January. For some students, the revised plans are a decidedly unwelcome development following almost two years of online instruction, limited gatherings, testing protocols and uncertainty. At Syracuse University, David Bruen, the student body president, said he supported the university’s decision to delay its start by one week, to Jan. 24, despite his feelings of disappointment.  “I’m someone who really believes in what’s best for public health,” said Mr. Bruen, 20, a political science major. “But the fact that this keeps going on is just frustrating and stressful and sad.” The decisions, made after consulting experts who said that transmission of the virus will likely surge after the holiday break, were not universal. Some major colleges, including the University of Michigan and Northeastern University, stood firm, stating that classes would begin as usual, even as the schools imposed a booster requirement. But broadly, fears are rising that campus life in 2022 could be a repeat of 2020. In some cases, students were advised, it would be best to remain at home for a while, if possible. Others announced new requirements that students receive booster shots and wear KN95 masks. The University of Miami said late Wednesday that it would start with remote-only classes on Jan. 18 amid surging cases of in South Florida. In-person classes are expected to resume on Jan. 31, an email to students and faculty said. Howard University in Washington, D.C., tweeted on Monday that it had seen a “concerning increase in percentage and the number of positive cases over the past three weeks,” delaying the start of its semester to Jan. 18.  Also on Monday, Princeton University said it would begin classes as scheduled on Jan. 24, but delayed the return of students by one week to Jan. 14, with students arriving gradually over 10 days. The university also said it would ban travel by students outside the campus vicinity until mid-February.  In Houston, Rice University sent a message to students Sunday announcing the delay of in-person classes until Jan. 24. The university said it was strongly encouraging students not to arrive on campus until the weekend of Jan. 22.  On Dec. 21, New York University posted an announcement that January classes would be held online. So did Columbia. Both schools advised faculty and staff to work remotely.  Binghamton University and the University of Illinois announced one-week delays in the start of classes. Wayne State University in Detroit announced that classes would be held online for at least three weeks and imposed a booster shot requirement. Ka Yee C. Lee, the University of Chicago provost, announced a one-week delay and then two weeks of remote instruction until Jan. 24. Undergraduates living in residence halls were strongly encouraged to delay their return to campus until at least Jan. 20. In California, some schools were moving classes online and others were imposing new vaccine requirements. Seven schools in the University of California system, including U.C.L.A., announced that classes would be remote for the first two weeks of the quarter. Other schools said they were either delaying in-person classes for one week or evaluating possible changes. And the University of Pennsylvania moved classes online for two weeks and delayed campus housing move in. Days before the United States had its first confirmed case of the Omicron variant on Dec. 1 in California, health officials in Nebraska began looking into six probable cases of coronavirus infection in one household, among them a 48-year-old unvaccinated man who had recently returned from a conference in Nigeria. On Dec. 2, the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory identified the Omicron variant as the cause in all six people, who ranged in age from 11 to 48. A study of the group released on Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that Omicron may have a shorter incubation period than previous variants: about 72 hours. It may take as little as three days for people to develop symptoms, become contagious and test positive, compared with four to six days with Delta infections and those caused by original coronavirus, the authors observed. Only one member of the household was fully vaccinated, and all but one member, including the traveler, had experienced confirmed infections in 2020. No household members reported underlying medical conditions. The study also reported that the family members experienced mild symptoms. The six described their illnesses as similar to, or milder than, those experienced during their first infection. “It is unknown whether the mild clinical syndromes or differing symptom descriptions are a result of existing immunity or altered clinical features associated with Omicron infection,” the study’s authors wrote. “The five reinfections, including one after full vaccination, might be explained by waning immunity, the potential for partial immune evasion by Omicron, or both.” A study in Norway that examined a large cluster of individuals who were infected with the variant at a Christmas party in Oslo also suggested that the incubation period was around three days. It is not yet clear how long people remain infectious with Omicron. Quebec, which is fighting the highest infection levels in Canada, announced on Tuesday that health care workers in the province who test positive for the coronavirus will continue working under certain circumstances. All essential workers in the province, including those who work in medicine, will be subject to the new rules, Christian Dubé, Quebec’s minister of health and social services, said in a news briefing. He said that workers who test positive will keep working “according to a list of priority and risk management.” He did not provide details but said more information would be released in the coming days. During previous waves, Mr. Dubé said, the goal had been to “identify and remove at-risk employees as quickly as possible.” But given the highly contagious nature of the Omicron variant, and so many people being infected and having to be pulled out of work, he said, “we have to do otherwise. We have no choice.” The average number of new cases per day in Quebec has risen 376 percent in the past two weeks, and the seven-day average of new daily cases in the province is over 8,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That number makes up more than half of Canada’s new cases every day, on average. The strain on health care workers around the world has been building since the beginning of the pandemic, and experts have warned that they are nearing a breaking point. In October, the World Health Organization estimated that more than 100,000 health care workers had died of Covid and urged countries to do more to protect them. In the United States, some states called in the National Guard this month to help run hospitals and nursing homes that have been hit hard by staff shortages and illness among their employees. Hugh Jackman, who is starring as Professor Harold Hill in “The Music Man” at the Winter Garden Theater on Broadway, announced on Tuesday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. “I just wanted you to hear from me that I tested positive this morning for Covid,” Jackman said in an Instagram video. “My symptoms are like a cold: I have a scratchy throat and a bit of a runny nose, but I’m fine. And I’m just going to do everything I can to get better, A.S.A.P., and as soon as I’m cleared, I’ll be back onstage.” Shortly after Mr. Jackman posted his video, “The Music Man” announced on Instagram that all performances would be canceled through Saturday. Tickets can be refunded or exchanged where they were purchased. Performances will resume on Sunday, and Mr. Jackman will return to the show on Jan. 6.  Several other Tony winners star in “The Music Man” alongside Mr. Jackman: Sutton Foster as Marian Paroo, Shuler Hensley as Marcellus Washburn, Jefferson Mays as Mayor Shinn, Jayne Houdyshell as Mrs. Shinn and Marie Mullen as Mrs. Paroo. Preview performances for “The Music Man” began on Dec. 20, with opening night scheduled for Feb. 10. While “The Music Man” has managed to stay open, other shows have not. The New York City Ballet announced Tuesday that it was canceling its remaining performances of “The Nutcracker.”  The producers of “Ain’t Too Proud,” a jukebox musical about the Temptations, also announced on Tuesday that their show will close on Jan. 16. The show has not run since Dec. 15, citing coronavirus cases. It is planning to resume on Tuesday, Dec. 28, and hoping to run for three more weeks before closing for good.  Last week, the musicals “Jagged Little Pill” and “Waitress,” as well as the play “Thoughts of a Colored Man” announced that they had closed without so much as a farewell performance — all were already on hiatus because of coronavirus cases among cast or crew. The efforts of “The Music Man” to stay open had just been highlighted on Thursday night, when the actress Kathy Voytko, a swing and an understudy for Marian Paroo in the musical, filled in for Ms. Foster, who had Covid, at the last minute. After the show, the actress and dancer Katherine Winter posted an Instagram video of Mr. Jackman praising understudies and swings as “the bedrock of Broadway.” “Kathy, when she turned up at work at 12 o’clock, could have played any of eight roles,” Jackman said at the curtain call. “It happened to be the leading lady. She found out at 12 noon today, and at 1 o’clock she had her very first rehearsal as Marian Paroo.” As the coronavirus and its Omicron variant spread, understudies and swings are becoming more important than ever: Shows are relying on them to step in for sick or unavailable leads. “This is unprecedented,” Mr. Jackman continued. “It’s not only happening here at the Winter Garden, but all over Broadway. This is a time we’ve never known.” The Omicron variant is blazing around the world with such speed that even the leader of Israel, one of the most highly vaccinated countries, warned on Tuesday that it cannot be stopped. “We can’t prevent it,” Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said, in blunt comments that reflected a growing consensus in nations where Omicron has caught fire: The virus is moving too fast to catch. That daunting notion — backed up by data from nations where Omicron is spreading rapidly only a month after it was first detected — is tempered by early evidence that the variant causes milder symptoms, with vaccinations and boosters helping prevent serious illness and death. Many experts worldwide have expressed concern that the sheer number of people who are likely to be infected could create a flood of patients, overwhelming already stressed health care systems. But that is running up against those who argue that it is time to accept that the virus is endemic, and that countries should move away from lockdowns and toward laxer rules including shorter quarantines. John Bell, a professor of medicine at Oxford University and an adviser to the British government, said that Omicron was “not the same disease we were seeing a year ago.” “The horrific scenes that we saw a year ago of intensive care units being full, lots of people dying prematurely, that is now history, in my view, and I think we should be reassured that that’s likely to continue,” he told the BBC on Tuesday. While the latest figures in Britain are incomplete because of the Christmas holiday, data published on Monday indicated that more than 300,000 new Covid cases had been recorded between Saturday and Monday. But Chris Hopson, the head of N.H.S. Providers, the membership organization for England’s health staff, said that while hospitalizations across Britain had risen, it was not a precipitous jump. “What’s very interesting is how many are talking about number of asymptomatic patients being admitted to hospital for other reasons and then testing positive for Covid,” he said of conversations with heads of hospitals, in a series of posts on Twitter. “Some are describing this as ‘incidental Covid.’” Britain appears to be a few weeks ahead of most other nations in the world in confronting the first wave of Omicron infection and, for the moment, has decided that the evidence does not warrant new restrictions. But the United Kingdom is hardly united in how to respond to the moment. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all started new curbs this week to slow the spread of Omicron, largely focusing on reducing indoor mixing. Across Europe, divisions can be seen in how to respond to what Prime Minister Jean Castex of France on Monday called a “film without ending.” His country is seeing a record number of cases, putting extra pressure on intensive care units in public hospitals. All the tools the world has grown familiar with over the past two years — lockdowns, passes proving vaccination status, limits on private gatherings, mask mandates, social distancing — are being deployed to different degrees across the continent. And pushback continues to build. On Monday night, thousands of people took to the streets of Germany to protest new measures under which all nightclubs will be closed, private meetings of more than 10 people will be banned and further restrictions will be put in place on movie theaters and cultural and sporting events.   The N.F.L. and the N.F.L. Players Association on Tuesday night amended this season’s Covid-19 protocols to mirror new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, halving the amount of time players who test positive for the coronavirus need to isolate regardless of their vaccination status. In a memo sent to all 32 of the league’s teams, Commissioner Roger Goodell said players infected with the coronavirus — whether vaccinated or unvaccinated — now need to quarantine for only five days, not 10, if their symptoms improve, after the C.D.C. revised its recommendation on Monday. Factors listed in the memo include whether the player’s fever subsided after 24 hours without medication, if their cough improved, and if team and league medical officials determine the player can return to the facility. The new protocols have drastic implications for the N.F.L., which has struggled to contain a surge of coronavirus cases as the playoffs approach. More than 94 percent of the N.F.L.’s players are vaccinated. Vaccinated players could clear protocols if they had two negative tests 24 hours apart, but positive tests for unvaccinated players normally led to their missing at least one game under previous rules, and the revised guidelines allow for them to potentially return to the field more quickly. The amendments follow a string of changes that the N.F.L. put in place this month regarding Covid-19 requirements. After previously testing vaccinated players weekly, the league and the players’ union agreed nearly two weeks ago to test them only when they are considered close contacts or show symptoms. It also mandated that essential staff who interact with players receive booster shots. Asymptomatic vaccinated players can also “test out” of protocols and return to play as soon as 24 hours after a positive test if they are no longer deemed contagious. But Tuesday’s memo is the first modification of protocols for the unvaccinated, who all season have been subject to stiffer requirements than their inoculated teammates. They are tested daily and must take separate planes to away games, among other things. The changes come after more than 90 players tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday, nearly one week after the N.F.L. rescheduled three games because of virus outbreaks fueled by the Omicron variant. The United States is averaging over 240,000 cases per day, and the memo recommended that all players and staff avoid social gatherings, bars and restaurants. In the last off-season, the N.F.L. mandated vaccinations for coaches and essential personnel, saying those who refused would be unable to interact with players. The league stopped short of requiring vaccinations for players, but strongly incentivized it by subjecting players who were not inoculated to stricter protocols. Demonstrations against Covid rules across Germany on Monday, featuring thousands of marchers, underscored the growing frustration as states prepare to introduce tighter regulations and lawmakers look to introduce mandatory vaccinations.  Rallies on Mondays have had special resonance in Germany since weekly demonstration walks on that day helped bring down the Berlin Wall in 1989. In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a northeastern state, about 15,000 marchers took part in protests in several cities, according to police estimates. On Monday, the state closed nightclubs, banned private meetings of more than 10 people and placed further restrictions on movie theaters and on cultural and sporting events. Other states imposed similar restrictions on Tuesday as part of an agreement with the federal government to counter an expected rise in infections from the Omicron variant. Those measures will add to rules targeting particularly the unvaccinated that were introduced as case numbers in Germany rose in the fall. In Bautzen, a town in the eastern state of Saxony, protesters attacked the police with bottles and fireworks when officers tried to stop a demonstration on Monday, the force said on Twitter. While most of the rallies occurred in eastern Germany, some sizable demonstrations took place in cities in the west as well. In Saarbrücken and Fulda, in the central state of Hesse, about 1,000 marched. In Wolfsburg, in the northern state of Lower Saxony, 800 turned out. As Germany braces for Omicron, lawmakers plan to discuss a general vaccine mandate in the opening parliamentary session of 2022. A vaccine requirement for medical workers and care facility employees passed this month and will go into effect in mid-March. After a renewed emphasis on the national vaccine drive, which included a task force led by an army general, 71 percent of the German population is fully vaccinated and around 44 percent of adults have received a booster shot. But vaccination rates in some states in the east of the country are significantly lower. In Saxony, only 63 percent of the population is fully vaccinated. The country’s constitutional court also ruled on Tuesday that legislation should be introduced to protect disabled people when hospital resources are stretched. The decision was in response to a suit brought by disability activists more than a year ago and aims to guard against discrimination in triage decisions should hospitals become overwhelmed. At the moment, hospital admission rates are actually declining in Germany, but during a wave of infections in November, medical centers in some hot spots were forced to transfer patients to other regions to relieve pressure on I.C.U. staff. A lengthy doctors’ strike in New Delhi against staffing shortages at state-run hospitals has crippled health services, creating fears of disaster if the Omicron variant overwhelms medical facilities. Medical students from across India have joined the protests, which intensified two weeks ago and have grown angrier after police officers were seen beating junior doctors during a march on Monday.  The New Delhi government has expressed concern over a rising number of coronavirus cases and announced new measures, including a nighttime curfew, to slow the spread of the virus. While the country’s overall case count remains low, daily infections in the capital region have risen by more than 300 percent over the past two weeks, according to the Our World in Data Project at the University of Oxford. It is unclear how many of the new cases are of the Omicron variant. As the doctors’ strike has stretched on, drawing in recent graduates and tens of thousands of the more than 70,000 doctors who work at government medical facilities nationwide, emergency health services have been the worst hit.  Videos from major state-run hospitals in New Delhi have shown patients on stretchers lying unattended outside emergency rooms. Many Indians rely on state medical facilities for care because of the high cost of treatment at private hospitals. The protests were triggered by delays in placing medical school graduates in jobs at government health facilities, as India’s Supreme Court considers an affirmative action policy aimed at increasing the share of positions reserved for underrepresented communities. Protesting doctors say they are not against the quotas, but want the court to expedite its decision so that graduates can begin their jobs. During India’s catastrophic coronavirus wave earlier this year, doctors and other medical personnel found themselves short-handed and underfunded as they battled an outbreak that at its height was causing 4,000 deaths a day. Doctors associations say that more than 1,500 doctors have died from Covid since the pandemic began. Protests continued across the country and outside major hospitals in New Delhi on Tuesday, a day after police officers in the capital detained more than 2,500 protesting doctors who were walking toward the residence of India’s health minister. India’s health ministry said it was saddened over the treatment of doctors during the protest on Monday, but said it could not proceed with job placements while the issue was being heard in the country’s top court. Dr. Suvrankar Datta, an official for the Federation of All India Medical Association, a doctors’ group that supports the strike, said as coronavirus cases rise in New Delhi and other parts of the country, there will not be enough doctors to handle the crisis. “We have already communicated to the government so many times that the health care infrastructure is understaffed like never before,” he said. If graduates are not placed in jobs quickly, he added, it creates “a completely catastrophic situation when cases rise.” Beaches that normally spring back to life for cold-water plunges on Jan. 1 may remain deserted, as annual New Year’s Day fund-raising swims have become yet another casualty of the Omicron variant. The swims are a quirky tradition in many Western countries, requiring participants to enter frigid waters to raise money for charity. But the emergence of Omicron — the highly transmissible variant that is now fueling record surges around the world — has shuttered a range of cultural institutions, from New Year’s Eve celebrations to Broadway shows. And now, largely because of Omicron, some of the world’s most daring — and charitable — swimmers will be kept out of the waters on New Year’s Day. The status of the charity swims are a reflection of the world’s patchwork approach to Covid restrictions. For some organizers, the cancellations were a yes-or-no decision, while others were inching toward Jan. 1 with contingency plans if the Covid situation worsened. Many of the North American events are still on, though some will have Covid guidelines. At Coney Island in New York, the New Year’s Day Plunge was set to go on as planned. But at one Seattle event, swimmers must wear masks and have a booster shot. In Canada, a slate of events have been canceled in Ontario and in British Columbia. But participants in Vancouver and Oakville, Ontario, could still take a “digital dip” by sending a picture of themselves in a snowbank or a kiddie pool. Swim events on Achill Island in Ireland and in the The Hague were canceled. But in County Wicklow, Ireland, and Catalonia, Spain, charity swims were tentatively moving forward. In the United Kingdom, where the charity swims are a beloved remedy after New Year’s Eve revelries, events were on in North Yorkshire, England, but off in Edinburgh, Scotland, and in Pembrokeshire, Wales, among other places. “We are deeply disappointed,” the organizers of the Tenby Boxing Day Swim in Wales said. “Covid wins again.” Almost four weeks ago, in an apparent fit of optimism, the N.C.A.A. approved the creation of a 42nd bowl game so that every eligible football team with an even record or better would have a postseason game. Never mind that the calendar already overflowed with bowls. The late birth of the one-time Frisco Football Classic set up the Miami (Ohio) Redhawks to play North Texas. It was fortunate the game was contested when it was: By the time the Redhawks won, 27-14, two days before Christmas, the bowl season had fallen into chaos. That day, Texas A&M withdrew from the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Fla., temporarily leaving Wake Forest without an opponent. Miami — the one in Florida — was warning that its participation in the Sun Bowl was in doubt because of the virus. And the College Football Playoff said its four teams risked forfeiting if they were not ready to play on time. The situation has only worsened since, as more outbreaks have led to more withdrawals and more reshuffling. All told, games have been canceled or reimagined from Honolulu to Boston, and it is anyone’s guess how many more will be affected by the time a national champion is crowned on Jan. 10 in Indianapolis — if, in fact, one is crowned. “It’s just déjà vu all over again of what we had last year,” Greg McGarity, the Gator Bowl’s chief executive, said in an interview on Tuesday. “The weird thing was, when the bowls were announced on Dec. 5, Covid wasn’t even a factor.” “Everybody thought that we were over the hump as far as that goes,” he continued, “and then Omicron hit and here we are again.” Even though the Omicron variant has produced a worrisome increase in hospitalizations among children in the United States, experts said that a combination of factors, including low vaccination rates, was the most likely explanation. Doctors and researchers said they were not seeing evidence that Omicron was more threatening to children. Instead, much of the rise in pediatric admissions results from the sheer number of children who are becoming infected with both Delta and the more contagious Omicron variant, experts said, as well as low vaccination rates among children over 5. “I think the important story to tell here is that severity is way down and the risk for significant severe disease seems to be lower,” said Dr. David Rubin, a researcher at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Preliminary data suggests that compared with the Delta variant, Omicron appears to be causing milder illness in children, similar to early findings for adults. That data, however, has not alleviated anxiety among parents nationwide, as caseloads in children have risen in several states. A number of states have reported increases of about 50 percent in pediatric admissions for Covid-19 in December. New York City has experienced the most significant rise, with 68 children hospitalized last week, a fourfold jump from two weeks earlier. Children overall are somewhat less protected from the virus than adults. Younger children do not yet qualify for vaccination, and only those age 16 and older qualify for booster shots, which offer the most effective shield against infection and hospitalization. In the week ending Dec. 23, about 199,000 childhood cases were reported nationally, a 50 percent increase compared with the beginning of December, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Roughly one in 10 American children has tested positive for the virus since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the academy. Infected children remain far less likely to become ill, compared with adults. But across the country last week, an average of 1,200 children each day have been hospitalized with the coronavirus, up from 800 at the end of November, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. (Some of those children arrived at the hospital with other medical issues.) Those numbers are well below the peaks reached last September, although experts also fear a wave of pediatric hospitalizations in the coming weeks, fueled by Omicron’s spread, holiday gatherings and a return to classrooms after Jan. 1. “We’re just holding our breath and bracing for a tsunami of impact,” said Dr. Patricia Manning, the chief of staff at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. A Delta Air Lines flight that was en route from Seattle to Shanghai turned back in midair last week because the Chinese airport had imposed new cleaning rules that would have caused delays, the airline said in a statement on Tuesday. “The new cleaning procedures require significantly extended ground time and are not operationally viable for Delta,” the airline said. Details of the new cleaning regulations in place at Shanghai Pudong International Airport were not immediately clear, but China has rolled out increasingly strict Covid-19 travel rules amid a growing outbreak in the northern city of Xian and before the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February. The scrapped flight left passengers with out-of-date Covid-19 test results and expired U.S. visas, according to Chinese news reports. The Chinese Consulate in San Francisco, which did not name Delta, said in a statement that it “had made a stern representation to the airline.” The new sanitation protocols also led EVA Air of Taiwan to suspend passenger services to Shanghai Pudong from the cities of Taipei and Kaohsiung until Feb. 3, Taiwan’s semiofficial Central News Agency reported. Another Taiwan-based carrier, China Airlines, is suspending flights from one city to Shanghai until the end of January and reducing flights on another route, according to news reports. The Chinese Embassy in the United States said in a statement that reports that the Delta plane had been turned around because of a ban on incoming flights were incorrect. Many domestic and international flights in the United States had been canceled because of staff shortages, the embassy noted, adding that it was “communicating with relevant airlines to actively understand the specific technical issues and discuss solutions to avoid similar incidents from happening again.” The outbreak in Xian remains small by global standards. On Tuesday, Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid in China, said that the city of 13 million people, where the local authorities last week imposed a lockdown, had reported 175 cases in one day, its highest daily count since the outbreak began this month. In total, 810 cases have been recorded in Xian. As the Omicron variant drives positivity rates to their highest levels of the pandemic in many parts of the world, major cities have scaled down or canceled New Year’s Eve events for a second consecutive year. Only months ago, expanding Covid vaccinations and loosening travel rules had promised a return of raucous New Year gatherings amid hopes that the pandemic might finally be waning. But the emergence of Omicron — the highly transmissible variant that is now dominant in the United States and fueling record surges in many nations — has prompted governments to reinstate travel restrictions, mask mandates and bans on large gatherings. Even as early studies suggest that Omicron produces less severe illness, experts warn that the staggering caseload could still overwhelm health systems. A number of Dec. 31 events have been canceled in countries where caseloads are rising swiftly, including in Italy, where the 14-day average of new cases is up 128 percent, and in France, where cases are up by 48 percent, according to the Our World in Data Project at the University of Oxford. In the United States, where daily cases have doubled over the past two weeks, some events have been canceled, but the annual celebration in Times Square in New York will go on, with attendance capped at 15,000. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, recommended on Monday that people “stay away” from large New Year’s Eve parties, especially when it is not clear who has been vaccinated. Speaking on CNN, Dr. Fauci said, “There will be other years to do that, but not this year.” As another 12 months living with the pandemic draws to a close, here’s a look at how Omicron has forced some cities to change their plans for Dec. 31: Last week, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a downsizing of the celebration in Times Square to at most 15,000 guests, nearly a quarter of the usual amount, who will be allowed in at 3 p.m. at the earliest. Attendees will be required to wear masks and show proof of full vaccination. Fox canceled its “New Year’s Eve Toast & Roast 2022” live broadcast from Times Square. The network said in a statement that “the recent velocity of the spread of Omicron cases has made it impossible to produce a live special in Times Square that meets our standards.” Several Los Angeles County holiday events have been canceled, including the New Year’s countdown in Grand Park, which will now be streamed. For the second year in a row, there will be no crowds allowed at the Space Needle’s fireworks show. People can watch on a livestream instead. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, announced last week that the New Year’s Eve event in Trafalgar Square was canceled, saying: “The safety of Londoners must come first.” Paris has canceled its celebration, which was to include fireworks over the Champs-Élysées. Prime Minister Jean Castex also announced that large public parties would be banned on New Year’s Eve. Celebrations have been scrapped in several Italian cities, including Rome and Venice. Outdoor events have been banned and nightclubs will be closed for the month of January. Berlin’s annual New Year’s Eve party at the Brandenburg Gate will go on, but without any audience members. The performances will be live on television. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has also announced that gatherings will be limited to a maximum of 10 people starting Dec. 28. Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo typically attracts tens of thousands of people for one of the biggest New Year celebrations in the world. This year, like last year, the revelry has been called off. Public drinking has been banned in Shibuya on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority has banned all social, political and cultural gatherings, including Christmas and New Year celebrations, according to The Economic Times newspaper. Restaurants and bars are allowed to operate only at half capacity. Cape Town is still allowing New Year’s Eve gatherings, but several restrictions are in place. There is a curfew from 12 a.m. to 4 a.m., masks are required in public areas and nightclubs are closed. The authorities banned New Year’s Eve celebrations throughout the country, including in Casablanca, Morocco’s most populous city. Restaurants will close 30 minutes before midnight, and there will be a curfew from midnight to 6 a.m. The national police force on Monday announced a ban on New Year’s Eve fireworks across the country, including in Kampala, Uganda’s capital. Nighttime religious services will also be prohibited."

Americans can now take rapid antigen tests from the comfort of their own homes. Many of these tests are available without a prescription and return results in just 15 minutes. Demand for the tests has surged in recent months, as the highly infectious Delta variant has spread and schools and offices have reopened; now the even more infectious Omicron variant has arrived. “All the manufacturers are ramping up production, but right now they can be hard to find,” said Gigi Gronvall, a testing expert at Johns Hopkins University. Although rapid antigen tests have their limitations, they are an important public health tool, experts said, particularly if you know how to use them. “Having that information and being able to make better decisions is very powerful,” said Mara Aspinall, an expert in biomedical diagnostics at Arizona State University who is also on the board of directors of OraSure, which makes rapid Covid tests. “And the ability to do this on a while-you-wait basis is something that we couldn’t do a year ago.” A handful of rapid antigen tests are available without a prescription, including the Abbott BinaxNOW, the Ellume Covid-19 Home Test and the Quidel QuickVue At-Home Covid-19 Test. Prices start at about $7 per test, although President Biden has announced plans to reduce prices by roughly one-third. All three detect small viral proteins, called antigens. The tests require rubbing a shallow nasal swab inside your nostrils and then exposing the swab to a few drops of chemicals. They provide results in about 15 minutes. The tests themselves are fairly straightforward, but each one involves a slightly different procedure, which should be followed to the letter. “If you’re doing at-home tests, you must read the instructions and follow them meticulously,” said Dr. Patrick Godbey, a former president of the College of American Pathologists. Ms. Aspinall concurred. “This is not the time for creativity,” she said. Polymerase chain reaction tests, which have typically been considered the gold standard for detecting the virus, are typically performed in a laboratory and involve making many copies of the virus’s genetic material. That process helps P.C.R. tests to detect even minute traces of the virus. Rapid antigen tests, which do not amplify the virus, are less sensitive than P.C.R. tests. If you take one during the earliest phase of an infection, before the virus has replicated widely, the test could return a false negative. Some of the at-home rapid antigen tests have an overall sensitivity of roughly 85 percent, which means that they are catching roughly 85 percent of people who are infected with the virus and missing 15 percent. In some studies, their real-world performance has been even lower. But the tests are more sensitive in people with symptoms than without and are most sensitive during the first week of symptoms, studies have found. And antigen tests are excellent at flagging people who have high viral loads — and who are thus most likely to be actively transmitting the virus to others, experts said. “The more virus you have in your nose, the more virus you’re breathing out into the air, and the more virus other people can then breathe in,” Dr. Gronvall said. “The tests are very accurate, and correlate very well with P.C.R., when people are most infectious.” Using the tests repeatedly — to routinely screen students for the virus, for instance — can compensate for their lower sensitivity. In one recent study, researchers found that when they tested infected college students and employees every three days, rapid antigen tests successfully identified 98 percent of infections, on par with P.C.R. tests. Rapid at-home antigen tests are a good option for people who have been exposed to the virus, who want to know whether a sore throat is Covid-19 or just a cold, or who want a little bit of extra assurance before visiting a vulnerable relative or after traveling to a virus hot spot, experts said. People with symptoms can take a rapid antigen test immediately, experts said, but those who have had a known exposure to the virus should wait three to five days before doing so. Testing too soon, before the virus has had a chance to replicate, increases the odds of a false negative. “And that is a critical, critical piece,” Ms. Aspinall said. “There are a lot of people taking a plane, getting off the plane and saying, ‘I’m negative — I can go visit Grandma.’” Some businesses, travel authorities and other organizations may not accept the results of at-home tests when proof of a negative test result is required, however. Rapid antigen tests work best when they are used serially. If you test negative after a possible or known exposure to the virus, or after developing symptoms of Covid-19, you should take a second test a day or two later, experts said. “Tests are a moment in time,” Dr. Gronvall said. “You don’t know the day or the hour” that the virus “breached your immune defenses and took up residence.” But until the tests are cheaper and more readily available, it may be difficult to persuade people to use them frequently, she noted. “We definitely need more tests on the market, and we need them to be lower cost,” Dr. Gronvall said. Rapid antigen tests are highly specific, which means that they generate relatively few false positives. However, a positive result is more likely to be a false positive when the prevalence of the virus is low; in these instances, people may want to take a second test. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends lab-based molecular tests, like a P.C.R. test, for confirmatory testing.) But experts recommended not waiting for the results of a second test to begin taking precautions. If you test positive, you should isolate yourself, monitor your symptoms and seek medical care if necessary. Consumers should also report positive results to their local health authorities. “If we don’t report tests accurately, we still won’t have a good idea of the actual caseload — how many people are running around that might be contagious, that might be passing this along to other folks,” Dr. Godbey said."

As a third year of the pandemic loomed, the seven-day average of U.S. cases topped 267,000 on Tuesday, according to a New York Times database. The milestone was marked after a year that has whipsawed Americans from a relaxation of rules in the spring to a Delta-driven summer wave to another surge that accelerated with astonishing speed as Omicron emerged after Thanksgiving. The record came only a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reduced the number of days that many infected Americans should remain isolated to five days from 10. The C.D.C. changed course as Omicron’s rapid spread has worsened a labor shortage, upending the hospitality, medical and travel industries, among others. The agency did not recommend rapid testing before people left isolation, and experts warned that that omission risked seeding new cases and heaping even more pressure on already overburdened health systems. The previous U.S. daily cases record was set on Jan. 11, when the seven-day average was 251,232. That was during a catastrophic winter that was far worse than this moment, when over 62 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated. And early evidence, including some hopeful reports from South Africa, suggests that Omicron causes milder symptoms than other variants, with vaccinations and boosters helping prevent serious illness and death. Hospitalizations have been rising, averaging more than 71,000 a day, but remain far below peak levels. While deaths have also been increasing, the daily average of 1,243 is a fraction of the record 3,342 reported on Jan. 26. Nevertheless, Omicron has a considerably easier time than Delta infecting vaccinated people. The coming cascade of patients threatens to overwhelm hospitals just as health care workers themselves are increasingly infected. A sizable number of patients remain infected with the deadlier Delta variant. On Tuesday, the C.D.C. reported that Omicron cases made up a significantly lower percentage of the overall U.S. caseload than was expected, at roughly 59 percent. And for the week ending Dec. 18, the agency revised down its estimate of 73 percent to about 23 percent, meaning Delta remained dominant until last week. Omicron is undoubtedly becoming the dominant variant, and that could be good news: A new laboratory study carried out by South African scientists showed that people who had recovered from an infection with the variant might be able to fend off later infections from Delta. Records are also being broken in Europe, but so far, the leaders of Britain, France, Spain and some other countries have resisted imposing harsh new restrictions amid calls from some who argue that it is time to accept that the virus is endemic and that countries should move away from lockdowns. These nations, confronted with Covid fatigue, are betting for now that high vaccine and booster coverage, along with earlier restrictions still in place, will be enough to keep the coronavirus manageable. The United States has also taken a similar path, as President Biden has repeatedly said that the era of lockdowns is over and promised to increase testing, double down on vaccination campaigns and prop up hospitals. But public health experts have warned that the measures will not be sufficient to prevent soaring infections and hospitalizations over the next few weeks. And demand for tests has exploded while manufacturers are scrambling to increase production and distribution. Testing is central to New York City’s plan to keep the largest U.S. school district open in the new year. The city announced on Tuesday that it would eliminate its policy of quarantining entire classrooms exposed to the coronavirus, and would instead use a ramped-up testing program to allow students who test negative and do not have symptoms to remain in school. Omicron is hitting the Mid-Atlantic States especially hard. Washington, Maryland and Virginia all broke records on Monday for daily case counts. “D.C. is a marker for what we’re likely to see in much of the rest of the country,” said Neil J. Sehgal, an assistant professor of health policy at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Health. “A tidal wave in Omicron cases is likely to flood much of the country in the next month.” Coronavirus positivity rates have surged in the Washington, D.C., region, urged on by the Omicron variant, which has steadily gained dominance in the United States throughout the holiday season. Washington, Maryland and Virginia all broke records on Monday in reporting their highest case counts of the pandemic. Washington reported almost 1,000 percent more new cases over the past two weeks and more than 9,000 new cases since Dec. 24. Maryland’s seven-day average for daily new cases stands at more than double the previous high recorded almost a year ago, in January. “The road to get through the next three or four weeks is going to be very rough,” said Earl Stoddard, the assistant chief administrative officer for Montgomery County, Md., which borders Washington. “There are going to be an absolute ton more cases. The hope is that we’re not going to see those necessarily reflected in hospitalizations that will lead to severe complications and or death.” Virginia reported more than 18,000 new cases over the Christmas weekend, with Fairfax and Arlington counties showing that positive cases had quadrupled over the past two weeks. None of the positive test counts reported in the region included at-home tests, meaning that the number of infected individuals was likely even higher. Neil J. Sehgal, a professor of health policy at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Health, said that despite high vaccination rates in the region, the Omicron variant was likely tearing through the population, which includes a large number of adults 20 to 49 who socialize and travel during the holiday season. “We’re seeing a bit of a holiday party phenomenon, I think,” Mr. Sehgal said. “People aged 20 to 49 are more transmission efficient — they’re more likely to infect people once they have been infected themselves.” Hospitalizations are ticking up, with more than 1,500 people having been hospitalized with Covid-19 in Maryland as of Dec. 23. While deaths have remained at about the same level over the past two weeks in most of the region, the number often lags behind the number of positive case rates by two to three weeks. And Maryland is juggling other issues, including a hack on Dec. 4 that has prevented the state from reporting county-level data on Covid-19 cases and shortages of emergency medical workers and hospital staff as they test positive. “We’ve got beds here, but we don’t have the nurses to staff those beds,” said Marc Elrich, Montgomery County’s executive. “You feel like the circle is closing in around you after a while.” The region is also struggling to keep up with demands for testing. In Northern Virginia, pharmacies that sell at-home Covid tests and libraries that had been handing out free kits have put up signs at their entrances telling people they have run out. Local news reported mass confusion among Maryland residents about testing locations and lines of hundreds of cars in the days after Christmas. The surge, which is expected to continue into the new year, has already upended a return to school for college students. George Washington University canceled in-person classes until late January and Howard University has pushed back the start of its spring semester. Mr. Stoddard said that public schools in Montgomery County were keen on ramping up testing in order to prevent further disruption to students. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that the Omicron variant now accounts for roughly 59 percent of all Covid cases in the United States, a significant decrease from the agency’s previous estimate. The update shows how hard it is to track the fast-spreading variant in real time and how poorly the agency has communicated its uncertainty, experts said. Last week, the C.D.C. said that Omicron accounted for approximately 73 percent of variants circulating in the United States in the week ending Dec. 18. But in its revision, the agency said the variant accounted for about 23 percent of cases that week. In other words, Delta, which has dominated U.S. infections since summer, still reigned in the United States that week. That could mean that a significant number of current Covid hospitalizations were driven by infections from Delta, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, suggested on Twitter. Hospitalizations typically lag several weeks behind initial infections. Experts said they were not surprised by the revisions, given that the C.D.C.’s estimates are rough guesses, with a wide range of possible values known as “confidence intervals.” Cases of Omicron can only be confirmed by genetic sequencing, which is performed on just a portion of samples across the country. And Omicron is still spreading extremely fast. Still, they said the C.D.C. did a poor job communicating the uncertainty of its estimates. The agency has had a series of missteps during the pandemic, including sending out botched tests early on and shifting guidance on masking. On Monday, when it halved the recommended isolation period to five days for those who test positive but show no symptoms, critics objected that there was no requirement to test before returning to work. Dr. Jerome Adams, who served as the U.S. surgeon general under former President Donald J. Trump, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday that while he respected the C.D.C., he disagreed with its decision on isolation periods. He also criticized the new guidance’s lack of a test-out option or recommendation for higher-quality masks. David O’Connor, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said of the Omicron estimate, “The 73 percent got a lot more attention than the confidence intervals, and I think this is one example among many where scientists are trying to project an air of confidence about what’s going to happen.” Dr. O’Connor said he initially thought the initial estimate “seemed high.” The agency came up with the estimate based on a “relatively small number of sequences,” he added. “It’s like playing Name That Tune, and trying to say, based on just the first note, if the song is ’Ice Ice Baby’ by Vanilla Ice, or ‘Under Pressure,’” Dr. O’Connor said. “Without more data, it can be really hard to know which one it’s going to be.” The new estimate of 59 percent is also a rough calculation, experts said, and will most likely be revised in future weeks. “I just want people to be very aware that that is an estimate, that’s not actually from sequence-confirmed cases,” said Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health. “With Omicron in particular, it’s been very difficult to have any sort of projections, because things are changing just so so rapidly.” Dr. Grubaugh, who is tracking probable Omicron samples in Connecticut, said that the variant makes up more than 80 percent of cases there, though he also notes that the country is heterogenous and the variant likely has a different prevalence in different places. “I don’t know how the C.D.C. built their algorithm, but human beings made these programs, and humans are fallible,” said Massimo Caputi, a molecular virologist at the Florida Atlantic University School of Medicine. “At the end of the day you can predict as much as you want but you need to look at the numbers you have in your hand.” Dr. O’Connor, who is tracking Omicron in Wisconsin, said the variant made up half of cases on the University of Wisconsin–Madison campus in just three days. “If I was making a betting prediction, it wasn’t so much that the number 73 percent was wrong, but the timing to get there was wrong,” he said. These predictions will likely become more accurate over time as more data on Omicron is collected. More precise numbers will be needed to smartly distribute Covid treatments. One of the great challenges of Omicron is the variant’s ability to thwart two of the three monoclonal antibody treatments, which can prevent serious illness in Covid-19 patients. As such, some hospitals have begun scaling back these treatments; administrators at NewYork-Presbyterian, N.Y.U. Langone and Mount Sinai all said they would stop giving patients the two treatments that are ineffective against Omicron. But the drugs could still help people infected with Delta. “If you still have those Delta cases, discontinuing monoclonals means all those people who would have benefited from them won’t be receiving them at all,” Dr. O’Connor said. Dr. O’Connor said scientists and health care providers need to do a better job of communicating the uncertainty in the predications they share with the public. “Having the humility to acknowledge that there’s a lot that no one knows and is unknowable right now is going to be really important.” The decision by federal health officials to shorten isolation periods for Americans infected with the coronavirus drew both tempered support and intense opposition from scientists on Tuesday. One of the main points of contention was the absence of a testing requirement and fears that the omission could hasten the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant. The new guidance, coming amid a crush of new infections that has starved many hospitals of workers, seemed to some scientists like a necessary step to shore up work forces in essential industries. And encouraging people to leave isolation early after testing negative could spare them the hardships of prolonged periods at home. But letting hundreds of thousands of infected people forgo those tests — even if, crucially, their symptoms were not entirely gone — risks seeding new cases and heaping even more pressure on already overburdened health systems, experts said in interviews on Tuesday. “To me, this feels honestly more about economics than about the science,” said Yonatan Grad, an associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who has tracked coronavirus infections in the National Basketball Association. Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview on Tuesday that the new guidance had been necessitated by the volume of people about to be infected. The C.D.C.’s recommendations cut isolation periods for infected people from 10 days to five. The agency did not recommend rapid testing before people left isolation, but asked infected people to wear a mask around others for five days. But some scientists maintain that rapid tests are the most convenient indication of whether or not someone remains contagious. Regulatory delays, manufacturing problems and shortfalls in government support have left rapid tests in extremely short supply as the Omicron variant has surged, pushing caseloads to near record levels in the United States. New York City, home to the nation’s largest school system, will eliminate its current policy of quarantining entire classrooms exposed to Covid, and will instead use a ramped-up testing program to allow students who test negative for the coronavirus and do not have symptoms to remain in school. The new policy, which Mayor Bill de Blasio referred to as “Stay Safe and Stay Open” during his announcement on Tuesday, will take effect on Jan. 3, when the nearly one million students who attend the city’s public schools are scheduled to return from holiday break. More than 27,000 new virus cases were reported in New York City on Tuesday, and more than 2,300 people were hospitalized with Covid-19, according to the state’s most recent count. Mr. de Blasio, Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor-elect Eric Adams, who takes office on Saturday, appeared together at a news conference to present a united front against school closures, despite an enormous surge in cases driven by the Omicron variant that has only worsened in the days since city schools closed for winter break last week. “Your children are safer in school, the numbers speak for themselves,” Mr. Adams said. Instead of delaying the start of in-person school and pivoting to remote learning, the city will double the amount of random surveillance testing it conducts, in hopes of detecting more infections while mitigating disruptions.  Many school districts have sought to limit disruption and prevent outbreaks by increasing testing. That model, known as “test to stay,” was endorsed by the C.D.C. earlier this month. States including Illinois, Kansas, California and Massachusetts have test-to-stay strategies, and the United Kingdom loosened quarantine rules for exposed students earlier this year.  In the Granite School District near Salt Lake City, a significantly smaller school district than New York’s made up of 90 schools and 63,000 students, the test-to-stay program has worked well, according to the district’s spokesman, Ben Horsley, and is now being adopted in Utah statewide.  In New York City, hundreds of classrooms were either entirely closed or partially closed last week because of Covid exposures. The city’s previous policy was to quarantine unvaccinated close contacts of infected students for 10 days. Many elementary school children in particular have not been vaccinated, even though they are eligible, and fewer than half of all city children aged 5 to 17 are fully vaccinated. City officials are expecting Omicron to continue surging in New York over the next few weeks, which will certainly be felt in classrooms. To avoid frequent closures and disruption, the city will provide students with rapid at-home tests to take if someone in their classroom tests positive.  If the students are not showing symptoms and test negative, they will be allowed to return the next day. They will then be given a second at-home test within five days of their exposure. Students or parents will self-report test results to schools.  Students will also receive rapid tests if their classmates or teachers are displaying symptoms. Those who test positive will have to quarantine for 10 days.  New York still plans to close entire schools when there is evidence of major in-school spread. People who have recovered from an infection with the new Omicron coronavirus variant may be able to fend off later infections from the Delta variant, according to a new laboratory study carried out by South African scientists. If further experiments confirm these findings, they could suggest a less dire future for the pandemic. In the short term, Omicron is expected to create a surge of cases that will put a massive strain on economies and health care systems around the world. But in the longer term, the new research suggests that an Omicron-dominated world might experience fewer hospitalizations and deaths than one in which Delta continues to rage. “Omicron is likely to push Delta out,” said Alex Sigal, a virologist at the Africa Health Research Institute in Durban, South Africa, who led the new study. “Maybe pushing Delta out is actually a good thing, and we’re looking at something we can live with more easily.” He posted the new study on the institute’s website on Monday. It has not yet been published in a scientific journal. Independent scientists said that the results of the South African experiment, though preliminary, were sound. Carl Pearson, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the findings were consistent with what is now happening in England. “Omicron arrives and grows rapidly, and the Delta trend switches to declining,” he said. And Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, said he was observing the same pattern in Connecticut. “We are seeing Omicron exponentially rise while Delta cases are falling,” he said. “This suggests to me that Omicron is outcompeting Delta for susceptible individuals, leaving them less susceptible to Delta in the aftermath, and driving down Delta cases.” When people began getting infected with the coronavirus two years ago, they produced antibodies and immune cells that could provide protection against it. As a result, it was very rare for a person to be reinfected in the months that followed. But starting in late 2020, new coronavirus variants emerged. Some of them, like Alpha, had mutations enabling them to spread rapidly. Others, like Beta, had adaptations that allowed them to evade antibodies — whether they were produced during a prior infection or in response to a Covid-19 vaccine. As the highly contagious Omicron variant sends U.S. case rates higher, a stream of colleges and universities around the country have announced that classes will be delayed or will begin remotely in January. For some students, the revised plans are a decidedly unwelcome development following almost two years of online instruction, limited gatherings, testing protocols and uncertainty. At Syracuse University, David Bruen, the student body president, said he supported the university’s decision to delay its start by one week, to Jan. 24, despite his feelings of disappointment.  “I’m someone who really believes in what’s best for public health,” said Mr. Bruen, 20, a political science major. “But the fact that this keeps going on is just frustrating and stressful and sad.” The decisions, made after consulting experts who said that transmission of the virus will likely surge after the holiday break, were not universal. Some major colleges, including the University of Michigan and Northeastern University, stood firm, stating that classes would begin as usual, even as the schools imposed a booster requirement. But broadly, fears are rising that campus life in 2022 could be a repeat of 2020. In some cases, students were advised, it would be best to remain at home for a while, if possible. Others announced new requirements that students receive booster shots and wear KN95 masks. The University of Miami said late Wednesday that it would start with remote-only classes on Jan. 18 amid surging cases of in South Florida. In-person classes are expected to resume on Jan. 31, an email to students and faculty said. Howard University in Washington, D.C., tweeted on Monday that it had seen a “concerning increase in percentage and the number of positive cases over the past three weeks,” delaying the start of its semester to Jan. 18.  Also on Monday, Princeton University said it would begin classes as scheduled on Jan. 24, but delayed the return of students by one week to Jan. 14, with students arriving gradually over 10 days. The university also said it would ban travel by students outside the campus vicinity until mid-February.  In Houston, Rice University sent a message to students Sunday announcing the delay of in-person classes until Jan. 24. The university said it was strongly encouraging students not to arrive on campus until the weekend of Jan. 22.  On Dec. 21, New York University posted an announcement that January classes would be held online. So did Columbia. Both schools advised faculty and staff to work remotely.  Binghamton University and the University of Illinois announced one-week delays in the start of classes. Wayne State University in Detroit announced that classes would be held online for at least three weeks and imposed a booster shot requirement. Ka Yee C. Lee, the University of Chicago provost, announced a one-week delay and then two weeks of remote instruction until Jan. 24. Undergraduates living in residence halls were strongly encouraged to delay their return to campus until at least Jan. 20. In California, some schools were moving classes online and others were imposing new vaccine requirements. Seven schools in the University of California system, including U.C.L.A., announced that classes would be remote for the first two weeks of the quarter. Other schools said they were either delaying in-person classes for one week or evaluating possible changes. And the University of Pennsylvania moved classes online for two weeks and delayed campus housing move in. Days before the United States had its first confirmed case of the Omicron variant on Dec. 1 in California, health officials in Nebraska began looking into six probable cases of coronavirus infection in one household, among them a 48-year-old unvaccinated man who had recently returned from a conference in Nigeria. On Dec. 2, the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory identified the Omicron variant as the cause in all six people, who ranged in age from 11 to 48. A study of the group released on Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that Omicron may have a shorter incubation period than previous variants: about 72 hours. It may take as little as three days for people to develop symptoms, become contagious and test positive, compared with four to six days with Delta infections and those caused by original coronavirus, the authors observed. Only one member of the household was fully vaccinated, and all but one member, including the traveler, had experienced confirmed infections in 2020. No household members reported underlying medical conditions. The study also reported that the family members experienced mild symptoms. The six described their illnesses as similar to, or milder than, those experienced during their first infection. “It is unknown whether the mild clinical syndromes or differing symptom descriptions are a result of existing immunity or altered clinical features associated with Omicron infection,” the study’s authors wrote. “The five reinfections, including one after full vaccination, might be explained by waning immunity, the potential for partial immune evasion by Omicron, or both.” A study in Norway that examined a large cluster of individuals who were infected with the variant at a Christmas party in Oslo also suggested that the incubation period was around three days. It is not yet clear how long people remain infectious with Omicron. Quebec, which is fighting the highest infection levels in Canada, announced on Tuesday that health care workers in the province who test positive for the coronavirus will continue working under certain circumstances. All essential workers in the province, including those who work in medicine, will be subject to the new rules, Christian Dubé, Quebec’s minister of health and social services, said in a news briefing. He said that workers who test positive will keep working “according to a list of priority and risk management.” He did not provide details but said more information would be released in the coming days. During previous waves, Mr. Dubé said, the goal had been to “identify and remove at-risk employees as quickly as possible.” But given the highly contagious nature of the Omicron variant, and so many people being infected and having to be pulled out of work, he said, “we have to do otherwise. We have no choice.” The average number of new cases per day in Quebec has risen 376 percent in the past two weeks, and the seven-day average of new daily cases in the province is over 8,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That number makes up more than half of Canada’s new cases every day, on average. The strain on health care workers around the world has been building since the beginning of the pandemic, and experts have warned that they are nearing a breaking point. In October, the World Health Organization estimated that more than 100,000 health care workers had died of Covid and urged countries to do more to protect them. In the United States, some states called in the National Guard this month to help run hospitals and nursing homes that have been hit hard by staff shortages and illness among their employees. Hugh Jackman, who is starring as Professor Harold Hill in “The Music Man” at the Winter Garden Theater on Broadway, announced on Tuesday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. “I just wanted you to hear from me that I tested positive this morning for Covid,” Jackman said in an Instagram video. “My symptoms are like a cold: I have a scratchy throat and a bit of a runny nose, but I’m fine. And I’m just going to do everything I can to get better, A.S.A.P., and as soon as I’m cleared, I’ll be back onstage.” Shortly after Mr. Jackman posted his video, “The Music Man” announced on Instagram that all performances would be canceled through Saturday. Tickets can be refunded or exchanged where they were purchased. Performances will resume on Sunday, and Mr. Jackman will return to the show on Jan. 6.  Several other Tony winners star in “The Music Man” alongside Mr. Jackman: Sutton Foster as Marian Paroo, Shuler Hensley as Marcellus Washburn, Jefferson Mays as Mayor Shinn, Jayne Houdyshell as Mrs. Shinn and Marie Mullen as Mrs. Paroo. Preview performances for “The Music Man” began on Dec. 20, with opening night scheduled for Feb. 10. While “The Music Man” has managed to stay open, other shows have not. The New York City Ballet announced Tuesday that it was canceling its remaining performances of “The Nutcracker.”  The producers of “Ain’t Too Proud,” a jukebox musical about the Temptations, also announced on Tuesday that their show will close on Jan. 16. The show has not run since Dec. 15, citing coronavirus cases. It is planning to resume on Tuesday, Dec. 28, and hoping to run for three more weeks before closing for good.  Last week, the musicals “Jagged Little Pill” and “Waitress,” as well as the play “Thoughts of a Colored Man” announced that they had closed without so much as a farewell performance — all were already on hiatus because of coronavirus cases among cast or crew. The efforts of “The Music Man” to stay open had just been highlighted on Thursday night, when the actress Kathy Voytko, a swing and an understudy for Marian Paroo in the musical, filled in for Ms. Foster, who had Covid, at the last minute. After the show, the actress and dancer Katherine Winter posted an Instagram video of Mr. Jackman praising understudies and swings as “the bedrock of Broadway.” “Kathy, when she turned up at work at 12 o’clock, could have played any of eight roles,” Jackman said at the curtain call. “It happened to be the leading lady. She found out at 12 noon today, and at 1 o’clock she had her very first rehearsal as Marian Paroo.” As the coronavirus and its Omicron variant spread, understudies and swings are becoming more important than ever: Shows are relying on them to step in for sick or unavailable leads. “This is unprecedented,” Mr. Jackman continued. “It’s not only happening here at the Winter Garden, but all over Broadway. This is a time we’ve never known.” The Omicron variant is blazing around the world with such speed that even the leader of Israel, one of the most highly vaccinated countries, warned on Tuesday that it cannot be stopped. “We can’t prevent it,” Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said, in blunt comments that reflected a growing consensus in nations where Omicron has caught fire: The virus is moving too fast to catch. That daunting notion — backed up by data from nations where Omicron is spreading rapidly only a month after it was first detected — is tempered by early evidence that the variant causes milder symptoms, with vaccinations and boosters helping prevent serious illness and death. Many experts worldwide have expressed concern that the sheer number of people who are likely to be infected could create a flood of patients, overwhelming already stressed health care systems. But that is running up against those who argue that it is time to accept that the virus is endemic, and that countries should move away from lockdowns and toward laxer rules including shorter quarantines. John Bell, a professor of medicine at Oxford University and an adviser to the British government, said that Omicron was “not the same disease we were seeing a year ago.” “The horrific scenes that we saw a year ago of intensive care units being full, lots of people dying prematurely, that is now history, in my view, and I think we should be reassured that that’s likely to continue,” he told the BBC on Tuesday. While the latest figures in Britain are incomplete because of the Christmas holiday, data published on Monday indicated that more than 300,000 new Covid cases had been recorded between Saturday and Monday. But Chris Hopson, the head of N.H.S. Providers, the membership organization for England’s health staff, said that while hospitalizations across Britain had risen, it was not a precipitous jump. “What’s very interesting is how many are talking about number of asymptomatic patients being admitted to hospital for other reasons and then testing positive for Covid,” he said of conversations with heads of hospitals, in a series of posts on Twitter. “Some are describing this as ‘incidental Covid.’” Britain appears to be a few weeks ahead of most other nations in the world in confronting the first wave of Omicron infection and, for the moment, has decided that the evidence does not warrant new restrictions. But the United Kingdom is hardly united in how to respond to the moment. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all started new curbs this week to slow the spread of Omicron, largely focusing on reducing indoor mixing. Across Europe, divisions can be seen in how to respond to what Prime Minister Jean Castex of France on Monday called a “film without ending.” His country is seeing a record number of cases, putting extra pressure on intensive care units in public hospitals. All the tools the world has grown familiar with over the past two years — lockdowns, passes proving vaccination status, limits on private gatherings, mask mandates, social distancing — are being deployed to different degrees across the continent. And pushback continues to build. On Monday night, thousands of people took to the streets of Germany to protest new measures under which all nightclubs will be closed, private meetings of more than 10 people will be banned and further restrictions will be put in place on movie theaters and cultural and sporting events.   The N.F.L. and the N.F.L. Players Association on Tuesday night amended this season’s Covid-19 protocols to mirror new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, halving the amount of time players who test positive for the coronavirus need to isolate regardless of their vaccination status. In a memo sent to all 32 of the league’s teams, Commissioner Roger Goodell said players infected with the coronavirus — whether vaccinated or unvaccinated — now need to quarantine for only five days, not 10, if their symptoms improve, after the C.D.C. revised its recommendation on Monday. Factors listed in the memo include whether the player’s fever subsided after 24 hours without medication, if their cough improved, and if team and league medical officials determine the player can return to the facility. The new protocols have drastic implications for the N.F.L., which has struggled to contain a surge of coronavirus cases as the playoffs approach. More than 94 percent of the N.F.L.’s players are vaccinated. Vaccinated players could clear protocols if they had two negative tests 24 hours apart, but positive tests for unvaccinated players normally led to their missing at least one game under previous rules, and the revised guidelines allow for them to potentially return to the field more quickly. The amendments follow a string of changes that the N.F.L. put in place this month regarding Covid-19 requirements. After previously testing vaccinated players weekly, the league and the players’ union agreed nearly two weeks ago to test them only when they are considered close contacts or show symptoms. It also mandated that essential staff who interact with players receive booster shots. Asymptomatic vaccinated players can also “test out” of protocols and return to play as soon as 24 hours after a positive test if they are no longer deemed contagious. But Tuesday’s memo is the first modification of protocols for the unvaccinated, who all season have been subject to stiffer requirements than their inoculated teammates. They are tested daily and must take separate planes to away games, among other things. The changes come after more than 90 players tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday, nearly one week after the N.F.L. rescheduled three games because of virus outbreaks fueled by the Omicron variant. The United States is averaging over 240,000 cases per day, and the memo recommended that all players and staff avoid social gatherings, bars and restaurants. In the last off-season, the N.F.L. mandated vaccinations for coaches and essential personnel, saying those who refused would be unable to interact with players. The league stopped short of requiring vaccinations for players, but strongly incentivized it by subjecting players who were not inoculated to stricter protocols. Demonstrations against Covid rules across Germany on Monday, featuring thousands of marchers, underscored the growing frustration as states prepare to introduce tighter regulations and lawmakers look to introduce mandatory vaccinations.  Rallies on Mondays have had special resonance in Germany since weekly demonstration walks on that day helped bring down the Berlin Wall in 1989. In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a northeastern state, about 15,000 marchers took part in protests in several cities, according to police estimates. On Monday, the state closed nightclubs, banned private meetings of more than 10 people and placed further restrictions on movie theaters and on cultural and sporting events. Other states imposed similar restrictions on Tuesday as part of an agreement with the federal government to counter an expected rise in infections from the Omicron variant. Those measures will add to rules targeting particularly the unvaccinated that were introduced as case numbers in Germany rose in the fall. In Bautzen, a town in the eastern state of Saxony, protesters attacked the police with bottles and fireworks when officers tried to stop a demonstration on Monday, the force said on Twitter. While most of the rallies occurred in eastern Germany, some sizable demonstrations took place in cities in the west as well. In Saarbrücken and Fulda, in the central state of Hesse, about 1,000 marched. In Wolfsburg, in the northern state of Lower Saxony, 800 turned out. As Germany braces for Omicron, lawmakers plan to discuss a general vaccine mandate in the opening parliamentary session of 2022. A vaccine requirement for medical workers and care facility employees passed this month and will go into effect in mid-March. After a renewed emphasis on the national vaccine drive, which included a task force led by an army general, 71 percent of the German population is fully vaccinated and around 44 percent of adults have received a booster shot. But vaccination rates in some states in the east of the country are significantly lower. In Saxony, only 63 percent of the population is fully vaccinated. The country’s constitutional court also ruled on Tuesday that legislation should be introduced to protect disabled people when hospital resources are stretched. The decision was in response to a suit brought by disability activists more than a year ago and aims to guard against discrimination in triage decisions should hospitals become overwhelmed. At the moment, hospital admission rates are actually declining in Germany, but during a wave of infections in November, medical centers in some hot spots were forced to transfer patients to other regions to relieve pressure on I.C.U. staff. A lengthy doctors’ strike in New Delhi against staffing shortages at state-run hospitals has crippled health services, creating fears of disaster if the Omicron variant overwhelms medical facilities. Medical students from across India have joined the protests, which intensified two weeks ago and have grown angrier after police officers were seen beating junior doctors during a march on Monday.  The New Delhi government has expressed concern over a rising number of coronavirus cases and announced new measures, including a nighttime curfew, to slow the spread of the virus. While the country’s overall case count remains low, daily infections in the capital region have risen by more than 300 percent over the past two weeks, according to the Our World in Data Project at the University of Oxford. It is unclear how many of the new cases are of the Omicron variant. As the doctors’ strike has stretched on, drawing in recent graduates and tens of thousands of the more than 70,000 doctors who work at government medical facilities nationwide, emergency health services have been the worst hit.  Videos from major state-run hospitals in New Delhi have shown patients on stretchers lying unattended outside emergency rooms. Many Indians rely on state medical facilities for care because of the high cost of treatment at private hospitals. The protests were triggered by delays in placing medical school graduates in jobs at government health facilities, as India’s Supreme Court considers an affirmative action policy aimed at increasing the share of positions reserved for underrepresented communities. Protesting doctors say they are not against the quotas, but want the court to expedite its decision so that graduates can begin their jobs. During India’s catastrophic coronavirus wave earlier this year, doctors and other medical personnel found themselves short-handed and underfunded as they battled an outbreak that at its height was causing 4,000 deaths a day. Doctors associations say that more than 1,500 doctors have died from Covid since the pandemic began. Protests continued across the country and outside major hospitals in New Delhi on Tuesday, a day after police officers in the capital detained more than 2,500 protesting doctors who were walking toward the residence of India’s health minister. India’s health ministry said it was saddened over the treatment of doctors during the protest on Monday, but said it could not proceed with job placements while the issue was being heard in the country’s top court. Dr. Suvrankar Datta, an official for the Federation of All India Medical Association, a doctors’ group that supports the strike, said as coronavirus cases rise in New Delhi and other parts of the country, there will not be enough doctors to handle the crisis. “We have already communicated to the government so many times that the health care infrastructure is understaffed like never before,” he said. If graduates are not placed in jobs quickly, he added, it creates “a completely catastrophic situation when cases rise.” Beaches that normally spring back to life for cold-water plunges on Jan. 1 may remain deserted, as annual New Year’s Day fund-raising swims have become yet another casualty of the Omicron variant. The swims are a quirky tradition in many Western countries, requiring participants to enter frigid waters to raise money for charity. But the emergence of Omicron — the highly transmissible variant that is now fueling record surges around the world — has shuttered a range of cultural institutions, from New Year’s Eve celebrations to Broadway shows. And now, largely because of Omicron, some of the world’s most daring — and charitable — swimmers will be kept out of the waters on New Year’s Day. The status of the charity swims are a reflection of the world’s patchwork approach to Covid restrictions. For some organizers, the cancellations were a yes-or-no decision, while others were inching toward Jan. 1 with contingency plans if the Covid situation worsened. Many of the North American events are still on, though some will have Covid guidelines. At Coney Island in New York, the New Year’s Day Plunge was set to go on as planned. But at one Seattle event, swimmers must wear masks and have a booster shot. In Canada, a slate of events have been canceled in Ontario and in British Columbia. But participants in Vancouver and Oakville, Ontario, could still take a “digital dip” by sending a picture of themselves in a snowbank or a kiddie pool. Swim events on Achill Island in Ireland and in the The Hague were canceled. But in County Wicklow, Ireland, and Catalonia, Spain, charity swims were tentatively moving forward. In the United Kingdom, where the charity swims are a beloved remedy after New Year’s Eve revelries, events were on in North Yorkshire, England, but off in Edinburgh, Scotland, and in Pembrokeshire, Wales, among other places. “We are deeply disappointed,” the organizers of the Tenby Boxing Day Swim in Wales said. “Covid wins again.” Almost four weeks ago, in an apparent fit of optimism, the N.C.A.A. approved the creation of a 42nd bowl game so that every eligible football team with an even record or better would have a postseason game. Never mind that the calendar already overflowed with bowls. The late birth of the one-time Frisco Football Classic set up the Miami (Ohio) Redhawks to play North Texas. It was fortunate the game was contested when it was: By the time the Redhawks won, 27-14, two days before Christmas, the bowl season had fallen into chaos. That day, Texas A&M withdrew from the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Fla., temporarily leaving Wake Forest without an opponent. Miami — the one in Florida — was warning that its participation in the Sun Bowl was in doubt because of the virus. And the College Football Playoff said its four teams risked forfeiting if they were not ready to play on time. The situation has only worsened since, as more outbreaks have led to more withdrawals and more reshuffling. All told, games have been canceled or reimagined from Honolulu to Boston, and it is anyone’s guess how many more will be affected by the time a national champion is crowned on Jan. 10 in Indianapolis — if, in fact, one is crowned. “It’s just déjà vu all over again of what we had last year,” Greg McGarity, the Gator Bowl’s chief executive, said in an interview on Tuesday. “The weird thing was, when the bowls were announced on Dec. 5, Covid wasn’t even a factor.” “Everybody thought that we were over the hump as far as that goes,” he continued, “and then Omicron hit and here we are again.” Even though the Omicron variant has produced a worrisome increase in hospitalizations among children in the United States, experts said that a combination of factors, including low vaccination rates, was the most likely explanation. Doctors and researchers said they were not seeing evidence that Omicron was more threatening to children. Instead, much of the rise in pediatric admissions results from the sheer number of children who are becoming infected with both Delta and the more contagious Omicron variant, experts said, as well as low vaccination rates among children over 5. “I think the important story to tell here is that severity is way down and the risk for significant severe disease seems to be lower,” said Dr. David Rubin, a researcher at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Preliminary data suggests that compared with the Delta variant, Omicron appears to be causing milder illness in children, similar to early findings for adults. That data, however, has not alleviated anxiety among parents nationwide, as caseloads in children have risen in several states. A number of states have reported increases of about 50 percent in pediatric admissions for Covid-19 in December. New York City has experienced the most significant rise, with 68 children hospitalized last week, a fourfold jump from two weeks earlier. Children overall are somewhat less protected from the virus than adults. Younger children do not yet qualify for vaccination, and only those age 16 and older qualify for booster shots, which offer the most effective shield against infection and hospitalization. In the week ending Dec. 23, about 199,000 childhood cases were reported nationally, a 50 percent increase compared with the beginning of December, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Roughly one in 10 American children has tested positive for the virus since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the academy. Infected children remain far less likely to become ill, compared with adults. But across the country last week, an average of 1,200 children each day have been hospitalized with the coronavirus, up from 800 at the end of November, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. (Some of those children arrived at the hospital with other medical issues.) Those numbers are well below the peaks reached last September, although experts also fear a wave of pediatric hospitalizations in the coming weeks, fueled by Omicron’s spread, holiday gatherings and a return to classrooms after Jan. 1. “We’re just holding our breath and bracing for a tsunami of impact,” said Dr. Patricia Manning, the chief of staff at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. A Delta Air Lines flight that was en route from Seattle to Shanghai turned back in midair last week because the Chinese airport had imposed new cleaning rules that would have caused delays, the airline said in a statement on Tuesday. “The new cleaning procedures require significantly extended ground time and are not operationally viable for Delta,” the airline said. Details of the new cleaning regulations in place at Shanghai Pudong International Airport were not immediately clear, but China has rolled out increasingly strict Covid-19 travel rules amid a growing outbreak in the northern city of Xian and before the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February. The scrapped flight left passengers with out-of-date Covid-19 test results and expired U.S. visas, according to Chinese news reports. The Chinese Consulate in San Francisco, which did not name Delta, said in a statement that it “had made a stern representation to the airline.” The new sanitation protocols also led EVA Air of Taiwan to suspend passenger services to Shanghai Pudong from the cities of Taipei and Kaohsiung until Feb. 3, Taiwan’s semiofficial Central News Agency reported. Another Taiwan-based carrier, China Airlines, is suspending flights from one city to Shanghai until the end of January and reducing flights on another route, according to news reports. The Chinese Embassy in the United States said in a statement that reports that the Delta plane had been turned around because of a ban on incoming flights were incorrect. Many domestic and international flights in the United States had been canceled because of staff shortages, the embassy noted, adding that it was “communicating with relevant airlines to actively understand the specific technical issues and discuss solutions to avoid similar incidents from happening again.” The outbreak in Xian remains small by global standards. On Tuesday, Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid in China, said that the city of 13 million people, where the local authorities last week imposed a lockdown, had reported 175 cases in one day, its highest daily count since the outbreak began this month. In total, 810 cases have been recorded in Xian. As the Omicron variant drives positivity rates to their highest levels of the pandemic in many parts of the world, major cities have scaled down or canceled New Year’s Eve events for a second consecutive year. Only months ago, expanding Covid vaccinations and loosening travel rules had promised a return of raucous New Year gatherings amid hopes that the pandemic might finally be waning. But the emergence of Omicron — the highly transmissible variant that is now dominant in the United States and fueling record surges in many nations — has prompted governments to reinstate travel restrictions, mask mandates and bans on large gatherings. Even as early studies suggest that Omicron produces less severe illness, experts warn that the staggering caseload could still overwhelm health systems. A number of Dec. 31 events have been canceled in countries where caseloads are rising swiftly, including in Italy, where the 14-day average of new cases is up 128 percent, and in France, where cases are up by 48 percent, according to the Our World in Data Project at the University of Oxford. In the United States, where daily cases have doubled over the past two weeks, some events have been canceled, but the annual celebration in Times Square in New York will go on, with attendance capped at 15,000. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, recommended on Monday that people “stay away” from large New Year’s Eve parties, especially when it is not clear who has been vaccinated. Speaking on CNN, Dr. Fauci said, “There will be other years to do that, but not this year.” As another 12 months living with the pandemic draws to a close, here’s a look at how Omicron has forced some cities to change their plans for Dec. 31: Last week, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a downsizing of the celebration in Times Square to at most 15,000 guests, nearly a quarter of the usual amount, who will be allowed in at 3 p.m. at the earliest. Attendees will be required to wear masks and show proof of full vaccination. Fox canceled its “New Year’s Eve Toast & Roast 2022” live broadcast from Times Square. The network said in a statement that “the recent velocity of the spread of Omicron cases has made it impossible to produce a live special in Times Square that meets our standards.” Several Los Angeles County holiday events have been canceled, including the New Year’s countdown in Grand Park, which will now be streamed. For the second year in a row, there will be no crowds allowed at the Space Needle’s fireworks show. People can watch on a livestream instead. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, announced last week that the New Year’s Eve event in Trafalgar Square was canceled, saying: “The safety of Londoners must come first.” Paris has canceled its celebration, which was to include fireworks over the Champs-Élysées. Prime Minister Jean Castex also announced that large public parties would be banned on New Year’s Eve. Celebrations have been scrapped in several Italian cities, including Rome and Venice. Outdoor events have been banned and nightclubs will be closed for the month of January. Berlin’s annual New Year’s Eve party at the Brandenburg Gate will go on, but without any audience members. The performances will be live on television. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has also announced that gatherings will be limited to a maximum of 10 people starting Dec. 28. Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo typically attracts tens of thousands of people for one of the biggest New Year celebrations in the world. This year, like last year, the revelry has been called off. Public drinking has been banned in Shibuya on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority has banned all social, political and cultural gatherings, including Christmas and New Year celebrations, according to The Economic Times newspaper. Restaurants and bars are allowed to operate only at half capacity. Cape Town is still allowing New Year’s Eve gatherings, but several restrictions are in place. There is a curfew from 12 a.m. to 4 a.m., masks are required in public areas and nightclubs are closed. The authorities banned New Year’s Eve celebrations throughout the country, including in Casablanca, Morocco’s most populous city. Restaurants will close 30 minutes before midnight, and there will be a curfew from midnight to 6 a.m. The national police force on Monday announced a ban on New Year’s Eve fireworks across the country, including in Kampala, Uganda’s capital. Nighttime religious services will also be prohibited."

Justo antes de Navidad, los estadounidenses están hartos y cansados de estar hartos y cansados: de rehacer los planes para adaptarse a los últimos riesgos del virus; de buscar pruebas caseras y no encontrarlas; de preguntarse si, después de dos años de esquivar la COVID-19, de sobrevivir a la enfermedad o de vacunarse, e incluso de recibir el refuerzo, la variante ómicron es la que inevitablemente contraerán. La sensación de temor ante la rápida propagación de ómicron —la más rápida de todas las variantes hasta ahora— ha invadido el noreste y la parte norte del Medio Oeste, que ya estaban inundados de casos y hospitalizaciones de la variante delta. Y el malestar ha crecido incluso en estados y territorios como Florida, Hawái y Puerto Rico, que habían superado un terrible verano a causa de la variante delta y, hasta hace poco, experimentaban una relativa calma del virus. “Estoy enojada”, comentó Mabel De Beunza, una publicista de poco más de 40 años que pasó 90 minutos en una fila de pruebas en el centro de Miami el lunes después de experimentar síntomas de resfriado. Sea cual sea el resultado de su prueba, ha decidido no ver a su madre, que está inmunodeprimida, en Navidad. “Hemos hecho tanto y todavía tenemos esto”, agregó De Beunza, cuya familia está vacunada y recibió la dosis de refuerzo. “Ha sido un año muy duro”. El martes, el presidente Joe Biden, adoptó nuevas medidas para combatir la ola, comprometiéndose a desplegar mil profesionales médicos militares en los hospitales, a abrir nuevos centros de pruebas y vacunación y a distribuir al público 500 millones de pruebas rápidas de forma gratuita. Algunos funcionarios estatales también han impuesto nuevos requisitos de vacunación y uso de cubrebocas. “Sé que están cansados”, dijo Biden desde la Casa Blanca. “Sé que están frustrados”. Destacó que las herramientas disponibles para prevenir, diagnosticar y tratar la covid son mucho más abundantes ahora que en los primeros días de la pandemia. “Todos deberíamos estar preocupados por la variante ómicron, pero sin sentir pánico”, declaró. “No estamos en marzo de 2020”. Las conversaciones con más de dos docenas de personas en todo el país revelaron que, más que pánico, los estadounidenses simplemente están agotados por la montaña rusa emocional de la pandemia y confundidos por los mensajes contradictorios de los expertos y líderes sobre las precauciones adecuadas. Alyssa Dipirro, de 30 años, estaba esperando en la fila para hacerse una prueba de covid en Orlando, Florida, el martes, pero no se había vacunado. Al principio de la pandemia, no quiso hacerlo estando embarazada, a pesar de que los expertos en salud pública garantizaban que las vacunas eran seguras para las mujeres embarazadas. Desde entonces, no la han tranquilizado los informes sobre personas vacunadas que contraen infecciones por covid, como está ocurriendo con mayor frecuencia con ómicron, aunque las vacunas siguen siendo eficaces para evitar la enfermedad grave. “Todavía tienen que hacerse pruebas si se exponen”, dijo. “Entonces, ¿qué sentido tiene esto?”. Florida, que hace tiempo eliminó casi todas las restricciones por el virus, está registrando en promedio 7068 casos diarios de coronavirus, lo que supone un aumento del 294 por ciento en las últimas dos semanas, según datos recopilados por The New York Times. El aumento fue repentino y sorprendente después de un par de meses de relativa tranquilidad del virus posteriores a una ola de la variante delta que mató a más de 22.000 floridanos, más que cualquier otra ola previa del virus, según Jason L. Salemi, epidemiólogo de la Universidad del Sur de Florida. Sin embargo, el invierno es la temporada alta de Florida, que atrae a residentes temporales y a una multitud de visitantes. Algunos asistentes informaron de que habían dado positivo por covid este mes tras acudir a eventos relacionados con la feria Art Basel Miami Beach. El martes, CDR Health, un contratista que proporciona tratamientos con anticuerpos monoclonales en algunas clínicas estatales, cerró temporalmente sus centros en los condados de Miami-Dade, Broward, Lee y St. Lucie. El Departamento de Salud de Florida dijo que los centros de varios condados cerraron el martes por capacitación, pero reconoció que algunas citas tuvieron que ser reprogramadas y que el estado estaba tratando de asegurar un reabastecimiento. “Ahora mismo, todos mis amigos en Miami tienen covid”, dijo Fabiana Vegas, de 21 años, el martes mientras esperaba en la fila para hacerse la prueba en Orlando. “Quería ir a Miami esta Navidad y no puedo”. Los casos también se han disparado en Hawái, donde el estado registra un promedio diario que es 468 por ciento superior al de hace dos semanas, según datos del Times. Hilton R. Raethel, presidente de la Asociación de Cuidados de la Salud de Hawái, calificó el aumento de dramático y culpó a la fatiga de la pandemia de las bajas tasas de vacunación de refuerzo entre los residentes. Alrededor del 17 por ciento de los residentes con el esquema de vacunación completo habían recibido un refuerzo hasta el domingo, la segunda tasa más baja del país. “‘He hecho tanto durante tanto tiempo que soy reacio a hacer más’”, dijo Raethel, resumiendo el sentimiento del público. En ningún lugar se ha producido una mayor explosión de casos que en Puerto Rico, que ha registrado un promedio diario de 1098, un aumento del 762 por ciento con respecto a hace dos semanas, según los datos del Times. La isla ha notificado más casos en los últimos siete días que en cualquier otra semana de la pandemia, lo que hizo que el gobernador Pedro R. Pierluisi autorizara nuevas restricciones, como la exigencia de vacunas y pruebas negativas para eventos masivos. Marisa Gómez Cuevas, de 34 años, dio positivo tras ir a un bar del Viejo San Juan para reunirse con unos amigos a los que no veía desde hacía meses. Días después, empezó a recibir llamadas de algunos de esos amigos, quienes le decían que se sentían mal. Uno de ellos terminó en el hospital. La semana pasada perdió un trabajo que tenía en una producción teatral y tiene miedo de volver a su trabajo de mesera. “Me preocupa que haya otro brote y que tenga que volver a cerrar”, comentó sobre el pequeño restaurante familiar donde trabaja. En otras partes del país que llevan más tiempo sufriendo un elevado número de casos, las restricciones han ofrecido a los residentes cierta tranquilidad. El lunes, Boston ordenó mostrar prueba de vacunación en los restaurantes y otros espacios interiores, lo que supuso cierto alivio para Christopher Glionna, socio gerente del Aquitaine Group, propietario de varios restaurantes en el extremo sur de la ciudad. “Es bueno para el negocio”, dijo. “La gente quiere reunirse”. Y muchas personas dijeron que tenían la intención de mantener sus planes de viaje de vacaciones, independientemente de las noticias sobre la variante ómicron. El lunes, en una estación de tren de Providence, Rhode Island, Sheryl Leary, de 51 años, y su marido, Sean Leary, de 53, se preparaban para salir hacia Nueva York. El concierto de las Rockettes para el que tenían entradas se había cancelado, pero aun así iban a ver Wicked en Broadway. Ambos están vacunados. “No queremos tener covid ni contagiar a nadie”, dijo Leary. Pero, añadió su marido, esas preocupaciones no fueron suficientes para desechar su viaje. “Es parte de la vida”, dijo Leary sobre el virus. “¿Qué vas a hacer, quedarte en casa?”. Sin embargo, en los estados que aún no han experimentado la última ola del virus, algunas personas ya están al límite. En Berkeley, California, Brian Edwards-Tiekert, de 43 años, presentador de una radio pública, y su mujer cambiaron esta semana sus protocolos de covid tras darse cuenta de la rapidez con la que se propagaba la variante ómicron. “No vamos a ver a nadie sin hacernos pruebas”, comentó. “Y estamos cambiando los cubrebocas de tela por los N95 o su equivalente”. Su esposa corrió a las farmacias en busca de pruebas rápidas caseras y solo encontró tres, suficientes para usar antes de una cena el miércoles, pero no para prepararse para otro compromiso social el jueves. El golpe emocional inherente a toda la preocupación y la planificación es agotador, dijo Edwards-Tiekert, al describir dos pestañas permanentemente abiertas en su navegador web: el pronóstico de lluvia de California y un tablero de seguimiento de covid. “Supongo que en este momento estoy un poco atontado”, concluyó.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in an address to the nation late on Saturday, said vaccines would available to those 15 to 18 years of age as of Jan 3. He also said booster doses would be offered as a “precaution” to health workers and those 60 years and above with comorbidities starting on Jan 10. India has fully vaccinated about 60 percent of its adult population of roughly 900 million people, while about 90 percent have received at least one dose of vaccine. After a sluggish start marred by mismanagement, the country’s vaccination drive picked up pace in recent months. But the government is short of the declared goal of fully vaccinating all adults by the end of the year. About 90 percent of Indians have been vaccinated with Covishield, a locally manufactured version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Initial studies in Britain found that AstraZeneca’s vaccinations showed no ability to stop Omicron infection, while its booster shot did raise antibody levels enough to suggest that it may offer protection against the Omicron variant. The previous variant, Delta, fueled a deadly second wave in India in the spring that devastated the country, overwhelming the health infrastructure and leaving hundreds of thousands dead. The government’s jumbled response, with political leaders continuing to hold massive election rallies and allow large religious gatherings as the virus spread, only worsened the disaster. Even as some Indian states have moved to restrict gatherings and impose measures after the detection of Omicron cases, both Mr. Modi and opposition leaders have held crowded rallies in Uttar Pradesh. The country’s largest state with 200 million people, Uttar Pradesh is headed to a crucial election in the spring. “In many countries of the world, infections are increasing due to the new Omicron variant,” Mr. Modi said during his address to the nation. “I appeal to all not to panic but remain vigilant.” INDIANAPOLIS — Of all the Covid patients that Ronda Stevenson is treating over Christmas, there’s one she cannot stop thinking about. He has been hospitalized for 10 months, and in all that time his 7-year-old daughter has never once been allowed to visit, prohibited from the hospital by age restrictions that keep families separated. Situations like this are bringing even veteran health care workers to tears. Ms. Stevenson, an intensive care unit nurse at Eskenazi Health in Indianapolis for the past seven years, cries as she talks about her patients and their families, making clear the grinding toll of the pandemic on already exhausted hospital work forces. “We’re pretty short-staffed,” Ms. Stevenson said. She added: “It’s getting harder.” Instead of taking holiday vacations this weekend, workers at strained hospitals across the nation are working 16-hour shifts. Some have been on the job every day for weeks. Festive meals have been replaced with protein bars and sports drinks. This Christmas weekend, with the United States facing another surge of illness stoked by a proportion of the population that remains unvaccinated, frontline workers are again sacrificing time at home with family to tend to Covid patients. In Indiana, which has among the highest rates of hospitalization and lowest rates of vaccination in the country, the situation is especially acute. “A lot of people, including myself, had scheduled time off but are now being asked to come in and pick up shifts to cover for one another and meet the increased demands of patient care,” said Dr. Graham Carlos, the executive medical director at Eskenazi, which is at capacity and has had a backlog of patients in the emergency room. He worries that it will only get worse. “If the numbers continue as they are, a tidal wave of infections is going to hit hospital systems, putting us in dire straits,” he said. Nearly two years into the pandemic, hospital workers have already faced the emotional toll of mass death. They have endured the frustration of pleading with the public to take precautions, only to watch outbreaks unfold as people ignored their calls. They have suffered the moral distress of not being able to give patients the ideal level of care. But this season, there is a new strain: Many workers have left because of burnout and anxiety. And with the Omicron variant pushing case numbers up dramatically, the caregivers who remain are getting infections, too. “This is the worst I’ve ever seen it,” said Maureen May, a nurse with 37 years of experience who serves as president of the Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals. She canceled her own holiday plans to pick up a shift on Christmas Day so that a co-worker could have time away. Facing urgent concerns about hospital staffing shortages, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week shortened the isolation periods for infected health care workers, allowing them to return to the job in seven days, instead of 10. President Biden also said that 1,000 military doctors, nurses, paramedics and other medical personnel would be deployed to shore up staffing levels at hospitals in the coming weeks. At IU Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, the National Guard has been helping with tasks such as transporting patients and cleaning. Now, a 20-person Navy team is arriving to help supplement the medical staff, which is depleted in part because about 350 workers across the broader hospital system are out with Covid or because they have been exposed to the virus. The New York State Department of Health is urging parents to get all children who are 5 and older vaccinated, citing a jump in pediatric hospitalizations associated with the coronavirus. Beginning the week of Dec. 5 through the current week, there has been a fourfold increase in Covid hospital admissions among children in New York City, where the Omicron variant is spreading rapidly, the department said in an advisory on Friday. About half were under the age of 5, and not eligible for vaccination. The advisory did not give the specific number of New York City’s pediatric Covid hospitalizations, but state data shows that more than 50 children under the age of 5 were hospitalized with Covid across New York as of Thursday. The jump in pediatric cases is evident in other states as well. The American Academy of Pediatrics reported last week that Covid cases were “extremely high” among those under the age of 18 across the country. Citing data as of Dec. 16, the academy said cases among those under 18 had risen by 170,000 for the prior week, an increase of nearly 28 percent since early December. Pediatric cases are higher than ever before in the Northeast and Midwest, the data show, and all regions of the country have significantly more such cases since schools reopened for in-person instruction this fall. The New York State advisory reported that during the week that preceded Dec. 19, none of the 5- to 11-year-old Covid patients admitted to the hospital had been fully vaccinated. In the same period, one-fourth of the 12- to 17-year-old hospitalized Covid patients had been fully vaccinated. As of Friday, only 16 percent of the state’s children aged 5 to 11 were fully vaccinated, the advisory said, a proportion that rose to 64 percent for those aged 12 to 17. “The risks of Covid-19 for children are real,” Dr. Mary T. Bassett, the acting state health commissioner, said in a statement. “We are alerting New Yorkers to this recent striking increase in pediatric Covid-19 admissions so that pediatricians, parents and guardians can take urgent action to protect our youngest New Yorkers. We must use all available safe and effective infection control, prevention and mitigation strategies.” Overall, cases in the state have spiraled upward this month, driven by the fast-spreading Omicron variant. The new variant made up 92 percent of new cases in New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate released Monday that grouped the four areas together. There were 32,591 new cases reported in New York on Friday, according to a New York Times database, a stark increase from the 6,644 reported on the last day of November. Some public health officials are predicting a continued steep increase in Omicron cases over the next few weeks, followed by a steep decline, similar to South Africa’s experience with the variant. Dr. Bassett said that parents could help shield children too young to be eligible for vaccination by ensuring that those around them have been vaccinated and received boosters, as well as by wearing masks, avoiding crowds and taking tests. The department encouraged parents and guardians to be aware of common Covid symptoms in children, including fatigue, headache, trouble sleeping, muscle aches, a cough that becomes productive, sore throat, chills, nasal congestion and a new loss of taste or smell. If a member of the household is exposed to the coronavirus, the advisory said, children should also undergo testing, social distancing and quarantining. A flurry of flight cancellations continued on Christmas Day, with U.S. airlines scrapping nearly 1,000 flights as the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus caused crew members to call out sick. The cancellations affected more than 10 percent of the flights scheduled by Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and JetBlue. American Airlines had canceled less than 5 percent of flights, according to FlightAware, which provides aviation data. By midday on Saturday the number of cancellations had already exceeded the total cancellations on Christmas Eve, a setback for travelers and airlines hoping this holiday season would be a return to relative normal. Globally, more than 2,500 flights scheduled for Christmas Day were canceled. “A number of Covid-related sick calls led us to make the difficult decision to precancel some flights scheduled for today,” said Derek Walls, a spokesman for American Airlines, which had about 90 cancellations on Saturday. “We proactively notified affected customers yesterday, and are working hard to rebook them quickly.” And the problems are expected to continue. Delta, which said weather in some parts of the country was also causing problems, expected to cancel more than 300 flights scheduled for Sunday. And FlightAware said other U.S. airlines had already canceled 150 flights for Dec. 26. The cancellations come during one of the busiest travel periods of the year, and Americans are flying nearly as much as they were prepandemic, with about 2 million people streaming through screening checkpoints each day in the week leading up to Christmas Eve, according to the Transportation Security Administration. At some points the number of travelers this year even exceeded the number of passengers who flew in 2019, according to the T.S.A.’s data. The travel period also came during a fresh surge of Covid cases. The U.S. is averaging almost 200,000 new cases each day, according to The New York Times’s coronavirus tracker, more than the average case load during this summer’s peak. An airline trade group asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday to shorten the recommended isolation period for employees who test positive for Covid-19 from 10 days to “no more than five days,” with a negative test to return. “The Omicron surge may exacerbate personnel shortages and create significant disruptions to our work force and operations,” the group, Airlines for America, wrote in a letter to the C.D.C’s director. But the Association of Flight Attendants has pushed back on that request, telling the C.D.C. on Thursday that “we support your agency’s current recommendation to isolate for 10 days” and that decisions to reduce isolation times “should be made by public health professionals, not airlines.” Clockwise from top left: A Christmas Eve Mass at Old St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Detroit.

Surges of new coronavirus cases are sweeping around the world, driving the global seven-day average of new cases to more than 755,000, according to a New York Times database. A Navy combat ship deployed to intercept drug trafficking in the Caribbean and East Pacific is stuck in the port at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, with a coronavirus outbreak among its fully vaccinated crew. Only some of those infected onboard the ship, the U.S.S. Milwaukee, were experiencing mild symptoms, said Commander Kate Meadows, a Navy spokeswoman. It was not clear how many infections involved the Omicron variant, which continues to gain dominance rapidly around the world. The crew held an open-air Christmas service on the pier on Saturday, which allowed the sailors to remain socially distanced and to follow public health guidelines, according to Commander Meadows. “They are using the open space and fresh air for as many safe activities as they can,” she said. “The chefs onboard are making a special Christmas meal today for everyone.” The Milwaukee had more than 100 sailors plus a helicopter combat crew and Coast Guard law enforcement unit on board when it left its home port in Jacksonville, Fla., on Dec. 14 as part of the U.S. Southern Command’s efforts to fight drug trafficking. The ship made a refueling and resupply stop at Guantánamo Bay on Monday and extended its stay there because of the outbreak. Commander Meadows added that the sailors had been confined to the pier and had not entered the base since arriving, sparing the small community at Guantánamo Bay the possibility of being exposed. In a statement on Friday, the Navy said that “the ship is following an aggressive mitigation strategy” and that “the vaccine continues to demonstrate effectiveness against serious illness” among the crew. Before the Milwaukee left Florida, Brian A. Forster, the ship’s commanding officer, said in a Navy news release that many of the crew members were on their first deployment and “eager to see the world and accomplish missions.” In March 2020, one of the military’s first encounters with the virus occurred aboard the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt. The ship docked in Guam, in the South Pacific, and ended up stranded there for months after dozens of sailors were infected and one died. The ship’s commander at the time sent a letter to Navy officials pleading for help tackling the outbreak and criticizing the Navy’s failure to provide the proper resources. He was removed from command of the ship after the episode. Active-duty troops in the Army and Navy were fired this month over their refusal to get vaccinated after President Biden mandated vaccination for the armed services in August. But there were only a small group of holdouts last week, with the Navy reporting that more than 98 percent of its members had been vaccinated. Amid an outbreak of positive coronavirus tests fueled by the Omicron variant, the N.F.L. re-formatted its testing strategy for the vaccinated, doing away with daily checks and testing only players who are symptomatic or are deemed to have had a close contact to a positive case. But players have still tested positive, ending up on the Covid-19 reserve list, making it clear that the pandemic will likely impact the competitive balance as teams make their playoff pushes. The games in Week 16 this weekend have important postseason ramifications. The Ravens and the Bengals will meet in a crucial A.F.C. North game, the Bills and the Patriots will have a rematch of their frigid chess match a few weeks ago and the Steelers have a must-win game against Kansas City. NAIROBI, Kenya — In just the past three weeks, the percentage of Kenyans who tested positive for the coronavirus jumped from less than 1 percent to more than 30 percent — the country’s highest positivity rate yet. In Uganda, nearly 50 lawmakers and their staff members, some of them vaccinated, tested positive this week after attending a sports tournament in neighboring Tanzania. And in Zimbabwe, skyrocketing infections have pushed the government to institute new restrictions on businesses and incoming travelers. Across Africa, countries are reporting a surge in Covid cases, and health officials worry about how the new Omicron variant will affect the world’s least-vaccinated continent. Omicron, which was first detected in southern Africa, remains highly contagious, but so far it is causing fewer deaths and hospitalizations than previous variants such as Delta. The latest wave comes as many African countries were beginning to reopen and businesses were hoping for a robust holiday season — only for governments to reintroduce curfews and quarantines and impose new vaccine mandates. Even as Britain and the United States lifted Omicron-related travel restrictions on southern African states in the past week, Africans faced new travel restrictions from elsewhere because of the rising infections. Beginning Saturday, the United Arab Emirates is suspending entry for travelers from Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania, and imposing additional requirements for those traveling from Ghana and Uganda. “We are unfortunately going to be celebrating the end-of-the-year holiday season in the middle of the fourth wave that’s sweeping across the continent,” Dr. John N. Nkengasong, the head of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a news conference on Thursday. At least 21 African countries are now experiencing a fourth wave of the pandemic, according to the Africa C.D.C. Three countries — Algeria, Kenya and Mauritius — are undergoing a fifth one. Omicron is tearing through Africa, with 22 nations now reporting the variant. It is not known whether the highly contagious variant is the dominant one or the one driving the surge of infections across Africa. But health experts say that even in countries where genomic sequencing is not readily available, the sudden bump in cases could point to the spread of the Omicron variant. And experts say overall Covid infections in Africa are likely higher given the lack of widespread testing in many countries. ROME — Pope Francis used his annual Christmas message on Saturday to pray for the many whose lives have been upended by the pandemic and to urge the world’s leaders to engage in “patient dialogue” to end conflict and “encounter others and do things together” at a time when so many are forced to be apart. In his address, Francis called on Jesus to “grant health to the infirm and inspire all men and women of good will to seek the best ways possible to overcome the current health crisis and its effects.” He reiterated pleas that Covid vaccines be made available to all. And he asked Jesus to “comfort the victims of violence against women, which has increased in this time of pandemic,” a scourge that he recently denounced as “almost satanic.” It was the second year that the pandemic had held sway in the pope’s Christmas message. But in a sharp contrast to last year, when he made the address from within the Apostolic Palace, surrounded by only a few because of coronavirus restrictions, this year Francis spoke from the central balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica to thousands of faithful present in the adjacent square. Such outdoor gatherings are currently prohibited in Italy, which was hit this past week by a steep surge in coronavirus cases. But Vatican City, which sets its own rules, allowed the crowd to gather on Saturday for the pope’s Christmas address. Those present were required to wear masks and respect social distancing. Throughout the address, his message — known as the “Urbi et Orbi” (Latin for “To the City and the World”) — was one of solidarity and community. “Our capacity for social relationships is sorely tried,” the pope said. “There is a growing tendency to withdraw, to do it all by ourselves, to stop making an effort to encounter others and do things together.” In her first Christmas address to Britain since the death of her husband, Queen Elizabeth II offered a personal message on Saturday as the nation is again experiencing a surge in coronavirus cases as the pandemic enters its third year. Since her husband, Prince Philip, died in April, Britons have been whiplashed by Covid. After prolonged restrictions, England reopened this summer to much rejoicing, but mere months later, many saw their plans upended again as the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the virus took hold. The royal family has also experienced its own turbulence. Concerns for the health of Queen Elizabeth, 95, have hung over much of the year, especially after she canceled a series of public engagements this fall. In her televised address on Saturday, the queen was seated at a desk in the White Drawing Room in Windsor Castle. Next to her was a photograph of her and Philip taken on their 60th wedding anniversary in 2007. “Although it’s a time of great happiness and good cheer for many, Christmas can be hard for those who have lost loved ones,” the queen said. “This year, especially, I understand why.” Referring to Philip, the queen said that she had “drawn great comfort from the warmth and affection of the many tributes to his life and work — from around the country, the Commonwealth and the world.” SEOUL — Three members of the global K-pop phenomenon BTS have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to Big Hit Music, the group’s management company. The company said that RM, 27, and Jin, 29, tested positive on Saturday after returning to South Korea from the United States this month. The day before, Big Hit Music announced that Suga, 28, who returned from the United States on Thursday, discovered that he was infected while in quarantine and after taking a P.C.R. test. All three received their second dose of the coronavirus vaccine in August, the company said. Suga, the stage name for the artist Min Yoon-gi, had tested negative before traveling to the United States, the company said. RM (Kim Nam-joon) and Jin (Kim Seok-jin) initially tested negative on returning to South Korea. The company previously said that Suga had had no contact with the other members of BTS. He was not displaying any symptoms as of Friday, and he was isolating at home, the company said. The news comes a month after another K-pop megastar, Lalisa Manoban, 24, of Blackpink, better known as Lisa, tested positive for the coronavirus. The other members of Blackpink — Jennie, Jisoo and Rosé — tested negative, the production company, YG Entertainment, said in an emailed statement last month. BTS has become a multibillion-dollar act, known for dynamic dance moves, catchy lyrics and fiercely devoted fans. In 2018, BTS became the first K-pop group to top the Billboard album chart, with “Love Yourself: Tear.” In September this year, the group gave a speech at the United Nations headquarters in New York, promoting coronavirus vaccinations and praising young people for their resiliency during the pandemic. The band traveled to the United States in November and performed at the American Music Awards. Big Hit Music announced later that members of BTS would be taking an “extended period of rest.” When Amir Blumenfeld was deciding what to buy for a Secret Santa gift exchange, he landed on something practical: an at-home Covid-19 testing kit. “What better gift is there than peace of mind?” Mr. Blumenfeld, a 38-year-old comedian, wrote in a direct message on Twitter. At the heart of his quip was an urgent concern: Coronavirus cases are once again rising around the United States as the Delta variant has given way to Omicron, a highly contagious form of the virus. The surge has fueled demand for Covid tests ahead of the Christmas holiday as families seek ways to gather safely. Some have braved hourslong lines at local testing sites to receive polymerase chain reaction tests, whose results, obtained in a laboratory, are considered the gold standard for detecting the virus. Many others have rushed to buy rapid at-home tests, depleting the stock at pharmacies and online stores. The frenzy for at-home testing has turned the kits into a commodity and even made them covetable holiday presents. Abbott Laboratories, which made headlines back in August for destroying materials used in its tests, citing limited shelf life, said the company is currently making more than 50 million BinaxNOW rapid antigen test kits every month. In January, the company said, it will increase its output to 70 million a month. Pharmacies have seen a spike in demand for at-home tests, most of which cost between $7 and $24. Some are starting to place limits on how many each customer can buy. “Following Thanksgiving and leading into the upcoming holiday week, we’ve seen an unprecedented increase in demand for rapid OTC Covid-19 tests across the country,” a spokesperson for Walgreens said. “Some stores may experience a temporary shortage in rapid OTC testing solutions.” The spokesperson added that a four-item purchase limit on test kits went into effect on Tuesday. A representative for Amazon said: “At this time, we are experiencing inventory shortages on some Covid-19 tests due to increased demand” and that the company is working to “secure additional Covid-19 test inventory” from selling partners."

One day after President Biden announced a new strategy to combat the staggering increase in coronavirus cases being fueled by the highly contagious Omicron variant, his coronavirus response team sought to remind the public that the nation was far better off than at the beginning of the pandemic. “Let me reiterate what the president said yesterday: This is not March 2020,” Jeffrey D. Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said at an afternoon news briefing. “We have more tools than ever before to protect people: vaccinations, boosters, testing and treatments.” Mr. Zients said the administration would double its existing supply — to more than one million doses — of sotrovimab, a monoclonal antibody treatment made by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology that is expected to work for Omicron cases. The drug, aimed at preventing high-risk Covid patients from developing severe disease, has been in very limited supply. The product is one of three monoclonal antibody treatments authorized for recently diagnosed Covid patients, but the other two are not likely to be effective against the Omicron variant. The federal government had previously ordered about 450,000 treatment courses of the GlaxoSmithKline treatment, including 300,000 expected in January. Now, the company is expected to make available about 600,000 additional doses in February and March, officials said. Physicians across the United States, though, are worried about the days immediately ahead. Hospital officials in Houston, Chicago and Washington State said on Wednesday that they had stopped providing the monoclonal antibodies made by Eli Lilly and Regeneron, which had been a mainstay of treatment, because they were not effective against Omicron. Top New York City hospitals made the same decision in recent days. The effective formula, sotrovimab, is for now in short supply. Dr. Shireesha Dhanireddy, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, said the allocation shipping on Wednesday for the entire state was about half the usual size.  In Washington State and elsewhere, coronavirus cases are rising and hospital staff members are falling ill or staying home because of an exposure. “It’s just a tough holiday season,” Dr. Dhanireddy said. Dr. Marcus Plescia, medical director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said there was concern nationwide about how quickly Omicron’s rise had depleted the tools used to fight the coronavirus. He said quantities were so short that he was concerned they would not go to those who need them most. “People who are more affluent, more connected, that’s who’s going to take advantage of this limited supply,” he said. “People who are low income, people of color are not going to get access to it. Disparities will be further pronounced by this.” In addition, the administration will have more than half a million doses of a newly authorized drug from AstraZeneca that may work against Omicron available in January, and Mr. Zients said the White House was “preparing to purchase significantly more across the next three months.” Rather than being for infected patients, it is authorized for preventing Covid in Americans with weakened immune systems who have not been adequately protected by vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday authorized the first antiviral pills for Covid, a treatment from Pfizer known as Paxlovid, for the same group of high-risk patients eligible for the antibody treatments. Merck’s similar product, known as molnupiravir, is also expected to win clearance this week. Omicron cases have skyrocketed since the variant was first identified in southern Africa at the end of November, and by last week, it already accounted for roughly three-quarters of all new cases in the United States. Many of those cases are occurring in vaccinated people, who tend to experience either mild symptoms or no symptoms. Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, tried on Wednesday to calm the nerves of a worried nation. “If you’re wondering how to stay healthy and protect your loved ones this winter, please get vaccinated, get boosted. Wear a mask in public indoor settings, and take a Covid-19 test before gathering with others,” she said. “We’re at a critical point, and how well these measures are implemented by all of us, caring for ourselves and for one another, will largely determine the outlook of the coming weeks and months ahead.” Three separate teams of scientists on two continents have found that Omicron infections more often result in mild illness than earlier variants of the coronavirus, offering hope that the current surge may not be quite as catastrophic as feared despite skyrocketing caseloads. The researchers examined Omicron’s course through populations in South Africa, Scotland and England. The results in each setting, while still preliminary, all suggested that the variant was less likely to send people in hospitals. “Given that this is everywhere and given that it’s going to be so transmissible, anything that would lower severity is going to be better,” said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at Emory University in Atlanta. Since the discovery of the Omicron variant in southern Africa in November, scientists have struggled to learn whether it causes more severe illness compared with other variants — and if so, in whom. The new research suggests that the variant may have biological features that make it somewhat less dangerous than Delta, the variant that dominated the world from summer till now. But Omicron’s lowered risk of hospitalization in all three countries also appears to be due in large part to immunity in those populations. Many of the infected already had protection against severe disease, either because of previous infections or vaccinations. While the new research is heartening, experts warn that the surge coming to many countries still may flood hospitals with Omicron cases, simply because the variant spreads so much more easily than previous versions of the coronavirus. “I don’t want to be alarmist, but I don’t think that you can let your guard down,” said Christina Ramirez, a biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles. Americans should take rapid tests before holiday events and should gather outside, open windows or find other ways to improve ventilation, Dr. Ramirez said. While Omicron may be causing milder disease on average, it’s also spreading faster than any variant yet. It is now the dominant variant in the United States, Europe and many other regions of the world. Yet encouraging news came from South Africa on Wednesday, suggesting that these surges may not last as long as previous ones. Omicron has fueled a record number of daily new cases, but officials reported on Wednesday that the wave of infections may have peaked. As cases in the United States rose to 154,000 daily cases on average over the past week, federal health officials added a defense against the rising threat to hospitals. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the first drug treatment for Covid-19 on Wednesday, offering a highly effective treatment against severe illness. On the Wednesday before Christmas, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced a record-breaking 28,924 new coronavirus cases — an increase of nearly 30 percent over yesterday’s total. But the governor stopped short of advising New Yorkers to cancel holiday plans. “We’re not saying don’t travel. Last year’s isolation was painful,” Ms. Hochul said, adding that there was no reason for families to forgo gathering. “Just be smart,” she warned, encouraging vaccines, boosters, masks and caution. “When you are thinking about who is at your dinner table, think about the most vulnerable person,” she said, urging people to “spread joy, not Covid, this holiday season.” Of the nearly 29,000 new cases statewide, 17,221 were from New York City, where outbreaks have begun to take a toll on hospitals and clinics. The city’s public hospital system announced today that after an outbreak at one of its facilities, it would limit visitors and require proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test result for those coming in. And to the dismay of many New Yorkers hoping to get tested before the holidays, the privately-owned urgent care company CityMD announced it would be temporarily closing 13 of its clinics in New York City, citing staffing shortages. Data released by the state today showed that the Omicron variant is on the rise across New York, accounting for 56 percent of cases reported in the past two weeks. To combat the surge, officials have expanded testing capacity, debuting new city-and-state-run testing facilities, and improved access to at-home rapid tests. Today, Governor Hochul announced new pop-up testing sites in Metropolitan Transportation Authority stations beginning with 42nd Street and Grand Central. The facilities will offer PCR testing seven days a week, beginning on Dec. 27, but closing for New Year’s Day. In New York City, Mayor-elect Eric Adams announced that Dr. Dave Chokshi, the city health commissioner, will remain in his role at the helm of the city’s pandemic response into 2022. Mr. Adams has appointed Dr. Ashwin Vasan, the president of the mental health nonprofit Fountain House, to be his new health commissioner, a role he will take over in March. New York City’s public hospital system began limiting visitors on Wednesday amid a spike in coronavirus infections because of the Omicron variant. Dr. Mitchell Katz, the chief executive of New York City Health and Hospitals, which operates the city’s 11 public hospitals, said the policy was put in place after visitors were linked to an outbreak at one hospital. City officials declined to name the hospital, saying they did not want to deter people from seeking care. Visitors will not be allowed except to see women in labor, people at the end of life, sick children, and those with intellectual disabilities or cognitive impairments like dementia. Visitors will have to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test no more than 48 hours before the day of the visit. ​“We’ve had a recent outbreak in one of our hospitals that we think is related to visitors — not, of course, their fault; there’s so much transmission going on right now in New York City because of Omicron,” Dr. Katz said Wednesday morning at a news conference. “For a short while, while we get the situation under control, we are going to have limited visitation,” Dr. Katz added. “We’ll always make exceptions in extreme cases.” The curtailing of visitation comes as the city is reporting an average of more than 10,000 new coronavirus infections per day, a 342 percent increase from two weeks ago. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, said at the same news conference that he had requested that the Federal Emergency Management Agency add 100 mobile Covid testing sites in the city. “Covid is raging, the variant is raging,” Mr. Schumer said. “We need these mobile testing sites. You see people lined up in every part of the city waiting to be tested.” The city has also just added seven new testing sites, bringing the total to 119 sites, after reports of long waits at some sites. The city will also add five mobile distribution sites to hand out rapid at-home tests. In spite of the rise in infections, Mayor Bill de Blasio has said the city will not shut down because he believes the Omicron variant will create a “brief and intense” period of new infections. “We are not telling people to hide, or hunker down, or surrender to this situation,” Mr. de Blasio said Wednesday morning on CNN. “We’re telling people to be smart.” The mayor urged those who are unvaccinated to get their shots and those who are eligible to get a booster. People who are sick or have pre-existing conditions should also take precautions, the mayor said. Speaking on MSNBC, Mr. de Blasio said Wednesday morning that he would prefer for the New Year’s Eve celebration in Times Square to proceed. “It does not make sense to do shutdowns,” he said. “So, we think about that event in the same vein. We’d like that event to move forward, so long as we can do it safely.” After the Omicron variant sent reports of new coronavirus cases skyrocketing to record levels in South Africa, case counts have now started falling, and are down by more than 20 percent in the last week, researchers in the country said. “This is encouraging and quite optimistic in terms of the decreasing trends and case numbers,” said Dr. Michelle Groome, an epidemiologist at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases. She cautioned, however, that the case figures may have been distorted somewhat by reduced testing during the holiday season. In the epicenter of South Africa’s latest outbreak, Gauteng Province, new infections seem to have peaked in the last week, Dr. Groome said. While the densely populated province — home to Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria — was still accounting for more than a quarter of the country’s new cases over the past week, they were down by nearly half from the week before. Three more of South Africa’s nine provinces also reported decreases. The country’s coastal provinces, including KwaZulu-Natal, are still reporting increases in new cases, officials said. The Omicron variant is dominant in South Africa, appearing in 95 percent of all new positive test samples that are being genetically sequenced. Studies based on early data from Gauteng Province suggest that Covid-19 cases caused by Omicron tend to be less severe than those associated with earlier variants. In the first four weeks of the Omicron wave, 5.7 percent of new cases were admitted to the hospital, compared with 15.6 percent in the Delta wave and 16.2 percent in the Beta wave. There was also a “downward trend” in patients needing critical care and in deaths from Covid-19, said Dr. Waasila Jassat, a public health specialist at the institute. However, the population of Gauteng is more heavily vaccinated than other parts of the country, and a high proportion of people there have some level of immunity, either from vaccination or prior infections. Researchers caution that the virus may behave differently in other populations. The data is welcome news in South Africa, where many people have been bracing for new lockdown restrictions as Christmas and New Year’s Day approached. The South African government has maintained a midnight-to-4 a.m. curfew and has discouraged large holiday gatherings, but has not reimposed the kinds of strictures it used early in the pandemic, like limits on alcohol and tobacco sales. More than 44 percent of the country’s adult population has been fully vaccinated, but the daily pace of new vaccinations has fallen short of the government’s goals. The holiday season — the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere — is a time when many thousands of South Africans travel to the countryside or crowd the beaches, and it is a popular time to marry. Weddings in particular could turn into “super-spreader events,” the health ministry warned. California will require health care workers to get booster shots by Feb. 1, officials announced on Wednesday, as part of a series of measures intended to stave off hospital staffing shortfalls and to keep schools open despite the unsettlingly rapid spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. The state will also require workers in high-risk congregate settings like nursing homes and prisons to get booster shots. Public health officials said the Feb. 1 deadline applies to workers who are eligible for booster shots under federal guidelines because it has been six months since they received their second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, or two months since they received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. People who were vaccinated more recently will be required to get a booster within 15 days of becoming eligible.  California officials also announced plans to provide one or two rapid tests for each elementary or secondary school student for use when the children return to school from winter break; to broadly expand testing-site hours; to deploy hundreds of additional workers to strained health care facilities; and to aggressively promote booster shots. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a news conference on Wednesday that the state hadn’t yet formally added booster shots to its definition of “fully vaccinated,” but that officials were considering.  Almost 9 million Californians have received at least one additional dose, he said, but he added, “We need to increase that number if we’re going to hold the line.”  Although scientists in California were the first in the nation to find a case of the Omicron variant in their state, the variant was quickly detected across the country, and in a matter of a few weeks became the dominant cause of coronavirus infections in the United States, accounting for nearly three-quarters of new cases. Mr. Newsom said that more than half the positive test samples sequenced in California recently have been found to involve the Omicron variant, probably a conservative estimate of its actual prevalence. As the Omicron wave has overwhelmed much of the country, particularly in places where restrictions have largely been lifted, California’s leaders have sought to paint a less dire picture, while also underscoring the need to prepare. “We can see where the hockey puck is going, and it’s always better to skate there than where it is,” said Mayor Sam Liccardo of San Jose. “The good news is, we know what we have to do, and that is get boosted and wear masks. So there’s no point in waiting.” Even before the emergence of the Omicron variant, communities across the state had begun to require people to show proof of vaccination or recent negative test results before entering indoor restaurants or other businesses. Earlier this month, state officials reinstated an indoor mask mandate. And in recent days, restaurants and other businesses have voluntarily shuttered when employees have tested positive. For many Californians, the memory still looms large of the traumatic surge last winter that stretched hospital intensive care units to the breaking point and made for grim, lonely holidays. Mr. Newsom noted on Wednesday that roughly 3,600 people were in intensive care units in the state right now, compared with almost 22,000 almost a year ago.  The governor and other officials have emphasized that keeping schools open is a top priority. “California schools have been open because of, not despite of, our priority on safety,” the governor said in a statement made jointly with a range of the state’s biggest education organizations, including the California Parent Teacher Association and several unions.  The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday authorized the first pill for Covid-19, offering a highly effective defense against severe illness that will arrive as the country endures another major surge of the pandemic. The drug, developed by Pfizer and known as Paxlovid, is authorized for Covid patients age 12 and over who are vulnerable to becoming severely ill because they are older or have medical conditions such as obesity or diabetes. Tens of millions of Americans — including both vaccinated and unvaccinated people — will be eligible if they get infected with the virus. The treatment could be available within a few days. Pfizer’s laboratory studies indicate that its pills are likely to work against the Omicron variant, which has rapidly become the dominant form of new cases in the United States. The treatment is meant to be taken as 30 pills over five days. Patients take three pills at a time: two of Pfizer’s pills and one of a low-dose H.I.V. drug known as ritonavir, which helps Pfizer’s drug remain active in the body longer. A clinical trial indicated that Paxlovid was highly effective when taken soon after an infection. In a final analysis of a key study conducted while the Delta variant was surging, Pfizer’s drug reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 88 percent when given to high-risk unvaccinated volunteers within five days of the start of their symptoms. Paxlovid appears to be substantially more effective than a similar antiviral pill from Merck, known as molnupiravir, that is still awaiting authorization by the F.D.A. In a clinical trial, Merck’s drug reduced risk of hospitalization and death for high-risk patients by 30 percent. The federal government has ordered enough of Pfizer’s pills to cover 10 million people, at a cost of about $530 per patient, but supply will be limited at first. Within a week of authorization, Pfizer is expected to deliver to the United States enough of its pills to cover 65,000 Americans. At current infection rates, that would be enough supply for less than one day if it were given to half of people in the United States who test positive for the virus. Pfizer is expected to deliver to the United States another 200,000 treatment courses in January and then another 150,000 treatment courses in February. The pace of deliveries is expected to increase sharply after that. Until now, monoclonal antibody drugs, which are typically infused into the bloodstream at a hospital or clinic, have been the only authorized treatments for Covid patients who are not yet hospitalized, but at higher risk of developing severe disease. But the antibodies have gone to fewer people than the pills are expected to reach, and most of the country’s supply of the antibody products is unlikely to work against Omicron. To get Pfizer’s pills, the F.D.A. said, patients will need to test positive for the virus and get a prescription from a health care provider, all within no more than five days after their symptoms start. Those requirements may pose serious challenges. While the agency did not specify which type of test will be needed, over-the-counter rapid antigen tests, which return results within 15 minutes, are expected to be widely used. President Biden announced on Tuesday that the administration is buying 500 million rapid tests to distribute free to the public, but it is not clear if that will be enough to meet what is expected to be very high demand. The Massachusetts governor activated hundreds of National Guard troops to help hospitals that are straining to treat an influx of patients. New Jersey’s largest school district is considering going remote after the holidays. And in New York City, the incoming mayor postponed his ceremonial swearing-in event, slated for Jan. 1. The highly contagious Omicron variant is forcing localities throughout the northeastern United States, which has some of the highest vaccination rates in the country, to enact the kind of cancellations and health restrictions that were first introduced in the early days of the pandemic, nearly two years ago. But no lockdowns have been announced. An average of more than 140,000 new cases a day are reported nationally, a figure not seen since February, when the nation was coming off a peak of infections last winter. The current rise in infections is coinciding with the holiday season and cold weather, both of which traditionally lead people from various households to gather indoors, which is a recipe for new infections. Though early indications are that vaccinations may prevent the worse outcomes of the Omicron variant, high rates of vaccination do not seem to be slowing its spread. Massachusetts (74 percent), New Jersey (70 percent) and New York City (72 percent) each exceed the national vaccination rate of 61 percent. In California, where 66 percent of people are fully vaccinated and the first case of the Omicron variant in the U.S. was reported, health care workers will be required to get a Covid-19 booster. “Omicron is spreading rapidly and we must do all we can to keep staff at hospitals and medical facilities healthy and safe to protect Californians during a potential winter surge,” Gov. Gavin Newsom of California wrote Tuesday night on Twitter. He is expected to make an announcement about the mandate on Wednesday. Elsewhere, the mayors of Atlanta and Chicago said Tuesday that they will reinstate their cities’ indoor mask mandates. Even as President Biden announced the opening of additional testing sites in New York, the deployment of military troops to help aid health care workers in Wisconsin and Indiana, and the use of the Defense Production Act to make testing material more readily available, he warned that people still needed to take steps to protect themselves from the virus. “We all want this to be over, but we’re still in it,” Mr. Biden said in a White House address. Still, some people, eager to resume a sense of normalcy, are acting more like it is 2019. In Oklahoma City, where 61 percent of people are fully vaccinated, traffic at the main airport is near pre-pandemic levels, officials there said. Last week officials in Wyandotte County, near the Kansas City metro area, narrowly voted last week to drop their mask mandate. Four days later, a case of the Omicron variant was detected in the county, according to the Kansas City Star. In Tennessee, whose 51 percent vaccination rate is among the lowest in the country, at least 1.2 million people who are eligible to get a booster shot have not done so as of Friday, the Nashville Tennessean reported. It quoted Dr. Alex Jahangir, head of the Nashville Covid-19 task force: “This virus continues to evolve. And our response needs to continue to evolve.” The rapidly spreading Omicron variant is motivating more than half of vaccinated U.S. adults to get a booster shot, while an overwhelming majority of unvaccinated adults said they were not changing their minds about getting inoculated, according to a new poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The poll, published on Tuesday, suggested that fear over the coronavirus has increased in the last month since the emergence of the highly contagious Omicron variant, which is less susceptible to vaccines than other variants. The United States crossed a milestone this month when more than 200 million Americans — over 60 percent of the population — became fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. But with a high level of vaccine hesitancy, the United States lags significantly behind other countries that have inoculated over 80 percent of their populations. The average daily rate of Americans getting their shots, at over 1.5 million, has been steadily climbing since the government widened eligibility for boosters in October, but remains far below its peak in April. About 49 percent of adult respondents told Kaiser that they were either very worried or somewhat worried about becoming seriously ill from the coronavirus, up from about 30 percent who said that in a poll published last month. The new figure includes 64 percent of Hispanic respondents, 52 percent of Black respondents and 43 percent of white respondents. Fifty-four percent of vaccinated adult respondents said Omicron made them more likely to get a booster shot, whereas 87 percent of unvaccinated adults said the variant would not motivate them to get a Covid-19 vaccine. A September poll by Kaiser, conducted after the Delta variant had sparked a summer virus wave, showed a similar gulf: That variant had been the leading reason that Americans decided to get vaccinated against Covid-19 this summer and that most said they would get boosters when eligible. But nearly three-quarters of unvaccinated Americans said that the need for boosters showed that the vaccines were not working. In the latest Kaiser poll, 48 percent of unvaccinated adults said “nothing” would persuade them to get vaccinated, and about 6 percent of unvaccinated adults said they would get a jab “if it were required for work/if it were mandatory.” The poll, which surveyed more than 1,000 people aged 18 and older, was conducted online and by telephone from Dec. 15-20. The results did not seem to surprise Frank Kruppa, the health director in one of the highest vaccinated counties in one of the highest vaccinated states: Tompkins County in upstate New York, which includes the city of Ithaca. Though 76 percent of residents are fully vaccinated, the county is leading the state in the weekly average of new cases, according to a New York Times database. “Booster dose appointments are hard to find in our county, because the demand is high,” Mr. Kruppa said on Tuesday night in a telephone interview. The high demand for boosters “was happening before Omicron was identified, but it’s continued.” Kaiser polling has also found that most parents are not eager to vaccinate their young children. A Dec. 9 poll found that 29 percent of parents of 5- to 11-year-olds said their children were vaccinated or would be vaccinated right away, while 32 percent said they would wait and see how the vaccines affected other children. WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court said on Wednesday evening that it would hold a special hearing next month to assess the legality of two initiatives at the heart of the Biden administration’s efforts to address the coronavirus in the workplace. The court said it would move with exceptional speed on the two measures, a vaccine-or-testing mandate aimed at large employers and a vaccination requirement for certain health care workers, setting the cases for argument on Friday, Jan. 7. The justices had not been scheduled to return to the bench until the following Monday. Both sets of cases had been on what critics call the court’s shadow docket, in which the court decides emergency applications, sometimes on matters of great consequence, without full briefing and argument. The court’s decision to hear arguments on the applications may have been a response to mounting criticism of that practice. The more sweeping of the two measures, directed at businesses with 100 or more employees, would affect more than 84 million workers and is central to the administration’s efforts to address the pandemic. The administration estimated that the measure would cause 22 million people to get vaccinated and prevent 250,000 hospitalizations. The second measure requires health care workers at hospitals that receive federal money to be vaccinated against the virus. It “will save hundreds or even thousands of lives each month,” the administration wrote in an emergency application. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld state vaccine mandates in a variety of settings against constitutional challenges. But the new cases are different, because they primarily present the question of whether Congress has authorized the executive branch to institute the requirements. The answer will mostly turn on the language of the relevant statutes, but there is reason to think that the court’s six-justice conservative majority will be skeptical of broad assertions of executive power. The last time the Supreme Court considered a Biden administration program addressing the pandemic — a moratorium on evictions — the justices shut it down. “Our system does not permit agencies to act unlawfully even in pursuit of desirable ends,” the court said in August in an unsigned opinion, over the dissents of the three liberal justices. In a statement on Wednesday night, the Biden administration vowed to vigorously defend the initiatives. “Especially as the U.S. faces the highly transmissible Omicron variant, it is critical to protect workers with vaccination requirements and testing protocols that are urgently needed,” said Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, adding: “We are confident in the legal authority for both policies.” The vaccination-or-testing requirement for large employers was issued in November by the Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA. Employers are allowed to give their workers the option to be tested weekly instead of getting the vaccine, though they are not required to pay for the testing. The rule makes an exception for employees who do not come into close contact with other people at their jobs, like those who work at home or exclusively outdoors. Under a 1970 law, OSHA has the authority to issue emergency rules for workplace safety, provided it can show that workers are exposed to a grave danger and that the rule is necessary. States, businesses and religious groups challenged the measure in appeals courts around the nation, and a unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, had ruled in favor of some of the challengers, blocking the measure. Last week, after the challenges were consolidated before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, a divided three-judge panel reinstated the measure. “The record establishes that Covid-19 has continued to spread, mutate, kill and block the safe return of American workers to their jobs,” Judge Jane B. Stranch wrote for the majority. “To protect workers, OSHA can and must be able to respond to dangers as they evolve.” In dissent, Judge Joan L. Larsen wrote that the administration “likely lacks congressional authority” to impose the vaccine-or-testing requirement. “The mandate is aimed directly at protecting the unvaccinated from their own choices,” she wrote. “Vaccines are freely available, and unvaccinated people may choose to protect themselves at any time.” Almost immediately, more than a dozen challengers asked the Supreme Court to block the measure. The second set of cases the court agreed to hear concerns a requirement that health care workers at hospitals that receive federal money be vaccinated against the coronavirus. Federal judges in Missouri and Louisiana blocked the requirement, which has exemptions for people with medical or religious objections, in rulings that apply in about half of the states. In the Missouri case, brought by 10 states, Judge Matthew T. Schelp ruled that the administration had exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the requirement and that it had not followed proper procedures in doing so. A divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis, declined to stay that ruling while an appeal moved forward. In the Louisiana case, brought by 14 states, Judge Terry A. Doughty blocked the requirement for similar reasons. Calling it a “close call,” a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit refused to issue a stay while the administration appealed. The requirement, Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar told the court, was supported by “both science and common sense.” “Requiring health care workers at facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid to be vaccinated,” she wrote, “protects the health and safety of patients at those facilities by reducing their risk of contracting the virus that causes Covid-19.” The Supreme Court had previously asked for responses to the emergency applications in the two sets of cases by Dec. 30, suggesting it would issue orders shortly afterward without hearing arguments. Its decision to do so followed a roughly similar move in challenges to a Texas abortion law. There, too, the justices scheduled arguments on an exceptionally expedited schedule. LONDON — Britain surpassed 100,000 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday for the first time since the start of the pandemic, as England’s government announced an easing of isolation restrictions.  The new toll of 106,122 new infections — the highest ever — comes as the highly transmissible Omicron variant continues to surge across the country. The uptick is a 50 percent increase over the past week, according to government data.  A surge in coronavirus cases has winnowed the staffs of hospitals, clinics, rail services, fire departments and ambulance services across England, where most pandemic restrictions have been lifted since the summer. Before the new case numbers were released on Wednesday, England’s announced that it was reducing the number of days that people are required to isolate for after showing Covid-19 symptoms to seven days from 10 days — a change that officials said was based on updated guidance from health experts, and that could help alleviate the staffing shortages. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said the move was based on guidance from the government’s Health Security Agencys that a weeklong isolation period along with two negative test results had “nearly the same protective effect as a 10-day isolation period.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson has resisted adding new restrictions before Christmas, although he has said that he “would not hesitate to act” after the holiday if needed. People in England will be allowed to end their quarantines if they can produce negative tests on days six and seven. That creates a more lenient policy than in the United States, where people can end their isolation periods 10 days after showing symptoms if they have not had a fever for 24 hours and if their other Covid-19 symptoms are improving. “This new guidance will help break chains of transmission and minimize the impact on lives and livelihoods,” Dr. Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the government’s Health Security Agency, said in a statement. She emphasized that people must continue to follow public health advice. People who are not fully vaccinated are still required to isolate for 10 days if they come into contact with an infected person. Elsewhere in Europe, governments have been divided in their responses to widening outbreaks of the Omicron variant. The Netherlands has closed nonessential shops, bars, restaurants, gyms, outdoor sports, cultural venues and schools. Sweden said this week that it was adding new restrictions on gatherings, and Finland is instructing restaurants to close early starting on Friday. Other countries have held off introducing further restrictions before Christmas. New rules in Germany will come into effect on Tuesday, and in Portugal, nightclubs and bars will close from midnight on Saturday for at least two weeks. In France, proof of vaccination is required for entry into bars and restaurants. The government has said it does not plan to add further restrictions. Health Minister Olivier Véran said on Wednesday that the focus was on the speedy rollout of booster shots. In Britain, Scotland and Wales are adding restrictions starting on Sunday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has not ruled out further restrictions in England, where a wave of infections is putting severe pressure on the National Health Service, which was already under strain from worker shortages caused by funding cuts, Brexit and the exhaustion from nearly two years of facing the pandemic. Britain is not experiencing the kind of dire shortage of beds that hospitals faced during earlier peaks of the pandemic, but the pressure on the system caused by staff illnesses is evident across the country. Data projections from the Health Service Journal, a trade publication, indicated that one in three workers in the National Health Service could be absent from work by New Year’s Eve if the current case rate continues. Although some evidence suggests that the Omicron variant may produce less severe symptoms than Delta, it also appears to be up to twice as transmissible. WASHINGTON — President Biden again tested negative for the coronavirus on Wednesday, five days after coming into close contact with a White House official who later tested positive for the virus, the administration said. “This morning, President Biden received a P.C.R. test and the test result was negative,” the White House said in a brief statement. Mr. Biden spent about 30 minutes near the official aboard Air Force One on a trip from South Carolina to Pennsylvania on Friday, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said on Monday. That official, who was vaccinated and had received a booster shot, began experiencing symptoms two days later and tested positive on Monday morning. “The president is tested on a regular basis,” Ms. Psaki said at the time, adding that an antigen test on Sunday and a P.C.R. test on Monday both came back negative. She told reporters the following day that Mr. Biden had been “asymptomatic” and was maintaining his work schedule. As a fully vaccinated person, the president was not required to quarantine after exposure, Ms. Psaki said on Monday. According to guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fully vaccinated people who have had close contact with someone with Covid should be tested five to seven days from the date of exposure and wear a mask in public indoor settings for two weeks, or until they receive a negative test result. Mr. Biden’s advisers say they have taken extra precautions to keep him safe from exposure, including a protocol that requires officials who meet with him to be tested that day. Officials who see the president daily are therefore tested daily, an administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe internal planning. New York City’s jails are experiencing a spike in coronavirus cases as the Omicron variant spreads, gravely threatening detainees at the end of a year that has already seen 16 people die after being held in custody. According to a letter sent by the departing Correction Department commissioner, Vincent Schiraldi, the coronavirus positivity rate has jumped drastically in the last several days among incarcerated people, only 38 percent of whom are fully vaccinated. (Forty-four percent have had one shot.) Among city residents, 71 percent are fully vaccinated. Mr. Schiraldi’s letter, sent on Tuesday to city district attorneys, public defenders and judges, said that the seven-day test positivity rate among incarcerated people had jumped to over 17 percent on Monday from 4.8 percent the previous week. Citywide, the seven-day average positivity rate was 11.2 percent as of Monday. “The risks to the human beings in our custody are at a crisis level,” Mr. Schiraldi wrote, adding that the jail population faced “an equal or greater level of risk from Covid now as it did at the start of the pandemic.” The department on Tuesday announced that it would suspend in-person visits with detainees as well as programs and services, including religious services, in response to the rise in cases. Officials said they would continue to offer vaccines and boosters to people in custody and to test and quarantine newly admitted detainees. A coalition of public defender organizations released a statement calling for the release of those behind bars and urging elected officials, district attorneys and judges to do all they can to stop new jail admissions. “Without vaccinations, in a congregate setting, with people who often have health problems and are vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, we’re worried about more deaths,” said Tina Luongo, the attorney in charge of the Legal Aid Society’s criminal defense practice, calling for “immediate steps to get as many people off of Rikers as possible.” Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio stressed that the city was experiencing an intense surge in cases spurred by the Omicron variant, but with far fewer hospitalizations than in previous waves. He added that 85 percent of uniformed staff in the system were vaccinated, after the imposition of a mandate that took effect Dec. 1. Dr. Mitchell Katz, the chief executive of New York City Health and Hospitals, said that new units had been opened to isolate detainees with the virus from the general population. None of the detainees who recently tested positive required hospitalization, he said. Spokespeople for the city’s five district attorneys said that their offices were reviewing cases in which bail had been set or people had been detained, and were working toward the release of those who could be safely freed.  A spokeswoman for Gov. Kathy Hochul said that the governor had previously taken action to address concerns in jails, and that her administration was “committed to continuing to work with elected partners and advocates on solutions to improve justice and safety.” Benny Boscio, the president of a union that represents correction officers, blamed Mr. Schiraldi for the surge in cases in the jails, saying that the department had been negligent when it came to ensuring that visitors did not have the virus. “By allowing visitors to come into our jails without having to show proof of vaccination and without mandating the inmates be vaccinated, Commissioner Schiraldi has once again put thousands of lives in jeopardy,” Mr. Boscio’s statement said. In the spring of 2020, Mayor de Blasio, along with public defenders and other local officials, helped champion an effort to release vulnerable populations from city jails. That led to hundreds of people being released and the total population of the jails dropping to fewer than 4,000, a low not seen for decades. But the population rose steadily beginning in the summer of 2020. There are currently about 5,400 people being held in New York City’s jails, most of them at the troubled Rikers Island complex. The pandemic and a severe staffing shortage have crippled the system on Rikers, leaving detainees in control of parts of the facilities at times. A federal monitor appointed to oversee reforms recently wrote that the Department of Correction was “trapped in a state of disrepair.” The 16 deaths represent the deadliest year for the jail system since 2013. Several were suicides; the causes of nine of the deaths remain under investigation. Two of the men who died, Victor Mercado and Isaabdul Karim, had contracted the virus before their deaths, according to their lawyers.  The purchase of at-home coronavirus tests will be capped at Walgreens and CVS locations nationwide as demand for kits continues to surge amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. CVS announced in a statement on Tuesday that the pharmacy had added a limit of six test kits per purchase both in stores and online. The company, which has more than 4,800 locations, said that kits sold online might become temporarily out of stock as it tries to make them available in stores to meet demand. Walgreens also announced on Tuesday that the company would limit purchases of at-home test kits to four. The pharmacy chain said some stores might experience a temporary shortage in rapid over-the-counter testing kits. “We ask that our customers please show patience and understanding,” John Standley, the president of Walgreens, said in a statement. Amazon also limited the purchase of at-home test kits made by the company, which customers must mail in to a lab to be processed, to 10 per person. The cap does not apply to third-party sellers, who can set their own quantity limits on the website. Walmart took similar measures on Tuesday, limiting the purchase of at-home testing kits to eight per customer online. In-store purchases are not being capped, though the retail giant said that each store could set its own limits based on its inventory. The caps come as Omicron’s rapid spread — the fastest of any variant yet — has customers flocking to testing sites and pharmacies. At-home tests are flying off shelves, and Americans are sometimes waiting in line for hours at testing sites. Virus cases in the United States have risen 27 percent in the past 14 days, and hospitalizations have climbed 13 percent in the same period, according to a New York Times coronavirus tracker. President Biden said on Tuesday that the government would buy 500 million rapid coronavirus tests and distribute them free to Americans, as well as create new vaccination and testing sites and send 1,000 military medical professionals to help hospitals nationwide. Walgreens and CVS offer several brands of coronavirus tests, including Abbott BinaxNOW, Acon FlowFlex, Quidel Quickvue, Ellume and Pixel by LabCorp. The pharmacies also offer lab-based testing with a one- to two-day turnaround. A record number of Americans have signed up for health plans through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces for 2022, after Congress lowered the cost of Obamacare insurance and the pandemic rocked many Americans’ employer-provided coverage. The Department of Health and Human Services said on Wednesday that 13.6 million people had enrolled in coverage that will begin on Jan. 1, more than in any previous year of the program. Enrollment remains open until Jan. 15 for those who want coverage that would begin in February. “What a great day it is to really see how the programs are working as they are intended,” Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which manages the marketplaces, told reporters on a conference call. The Biden administration has invested heavily in promoting the insurance subsidies available under the Affordable Care Act, and expanded the network of professionals available to help people enroll. But Ms. Brooks-LaSure said she thinks the main driver of enrollment is the lower prices most Americans will pay. A stimulus bill passed by Congress in March made many more Americans eligible for financial assistance in buying Obamacare plans. For most people with low incomes, comprehensive coverage is available for no premium. Health officials said that enrollment gains were largest in states that have not expanded their Medicaid programs, where Americans with incomes just above the poverty level qualify for Obamacare instead of Medicaid. Enrollment in Georgia grew by a third from last year, and enrollment in Texas increased by more than a quarter. In addition, the economic disruptions of the pandemic meant that some Americans who lost job-based coverage might be purchasing their own plans now.  France said on Wednesday that it would offer Covid vaccinations for children aged 5-11 — but not make it mandatory — as the country braces for a new wave of infections stemming from the fast-spreading Omicron variant. “We must, really, start this vaccination of children,” Health Minister Olivier Véran said on RMC radio. The news came the same day that a vaccine advisory committee in Britain recommended inoculation for children aged 5-11 who are in a clinical risk group or who live with someone who is immunocompromised. That could cover about 300,000 children, according to the group, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization. European nations such as Germany, Greece and Spain already offer vaccination for younger children, as does the United States. Mr. Véran said that France had waited out of caution, and that officials had consulted U.S. data on childhood vaccination that suggested a very low risk of side effects. “The data coming from the U.S. are very reassuring, and the vaccine is effective,” he said. In Britain, the government scientists advised giving the children doses that are a third of an adult dose. They said information for children who are not high risk would be assessed next year. France and Britain have refrained from imposing the type of lockdowns and closures that other European countries are resorting to as the Omicron variant spreads. Instead, Paris and London are betting that high vaccine and booster coverage, along with the restrictions already in place, will be enough to manage the variant. The push in France for the vaccination of children stems from recent data suggesting that cases were being partly driven by cases among unvaccinated children. The incidence rate among children aged 6-10 is on the rise and is twice that of the total population, according to a study published last week by the French health authorities. “Vaccination of children is a necessity,” Prime Minister Jean Castex said this month, adding: “I am a living example of that: It was my 11-year-old daughter who gave me the virus a few weeks ago.” It is unclear how many parents will have their eligible children vaccinated against the virus, however. Surveys have shown that most French parents oppose the idea. As the world anxiously awaits more data on how dangerous the fast-spreading Omicron variant will be, one modeling group — whose forecasts have been criticized as flawed in the past — released new projections suggesting a scale of infections that is almost unimaginable. The new forecast, by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, predicts that there will be three billion new coronavirus infections in the next two months — about as many as there have been in the last two years. The institute also predicted that Omicron would have a substantially lower hospitalization and fatality rate than Delta — something that has not yet been established. The I.H.M.E.’s Covid models have a spotty track record, and its methods have been routinely criticized by outside experts. Its overly rosy predictions in the early months of the pandemic were frequently cited by the Trump administration. Experts also cautioned that it was still very early to be making definitive forecasts, especially about Omicron’s severity. “That feels premature,” said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at Emory University. The I.H.M.E.’s projections suggest that the Omicron surge will peak at 38 million daily infections in late January, roughly triple the previous global peak in April 2021. “We are expecting an enormous surge in infections,” Dr. Christopher Murray, the institute’s director, said at a press briefing on Wednesday. But he also predicted that the vast majority of Omicron infections would be asymptomatic, and many would go undetected. In the United States, the wave could peak with as many as 400,000 reported cases a day in late January or early February, Dr. Murray said. Even if Omicron is milder than Delta, Dr. Murray said, the number of people in the hospital with a Covid diagnosis “is expected to be substantial and put stress on health systems.” In the United States, he said, “the pressure on hospitals should be about the same as last winter.” Outside experts expressed skepticism that it was possible to so confidently predict that Omicron would have dramatically reduced severity. “I am unclear what is driving their fairly optimistic estimates of reduced hospitalization and death,” Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said in an email. “While such reductions are certainly possible, I think the evidence is still very uncertain on that point, and the possibility of higher severity exists which would substantially increase the impact of a larger Omicron wave.” The institute estimates that the hospitalization rate for Omicron is just 4 percent to 10 percent of that for Delta and the fatality rate is 1 percent to 3 percent of Delta’s fatality rate. “These assumptions still seem to be on the more optimistic side of what I’ve seen elsewhere with people trying to parse the clues in the data,” said Joshua Salomon, an infectious disease expert and modeler at Stanford University. “That said, the projections overall don’t seem wildly implausible to me,” he added. But, he noted, there is still too much uncertainty to be highly confident in any forecast. Even as the number of coronavirus cases is skyrocketing in some parts of the United States, largely driven by the Omicron variant, the holiday travel rush appears unstoppable. On Friday, Los Angeles International Airport reported its busiest day since early 2020, and on Sunday, 2.1 million people passed through airports in the United States, nearly twice as many as at this time last year. For people who are determined to keep their travel plans, figuring out how to do so responsibly remains confusing. So what can travelers do? As cases of the Omicron variant continued to surge across Britain, prompting Wales to renew restrictions, AstraZeneca announced on Wednesday that it had renewed its partnership with the University of Oxford to develop a version of their coronavirus shot that targets the highly transmissible variant. “Together with Oxford University, we have taken preliminary steps in producing an Omicron variant vaccine, in case it is needed, and will be informed by emerging data,” a spokeswoman for AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish company, said in an email. Sandy Douglas, a research group leader at Oxford, disclosed the “preliminary steps” the university and AstraZeneca had taken to develop the booster in a Financial Times article published on Tuesday. As of Sunday, a total of 129 people suspected or confirmed to have Omicron had been hospitalized in England, and 14 had died, according to data released on Tuesday by Britain’s Health Security Agency. The steep rise in Omicron cases prompted the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to declare a “major incident,” or emergency, on Saturday. In Wales, the reimposed rules will require two meters of social distancing in public spaces and in workplaces, and the “rule of six,” which limits social gatherings to six people, will apply in places like pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theaters, Reuters reported on Wednesday. The coronavirus pandemic’s resurgence menaced the college football season’s closing weeks on Wednesday, when one team withdrew from its bowl game and the four national title contenders were warned that they could forfeit if they were not able to compete on time. Minutes after Texas A&M announced its withdrawal from next week’s Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Fla., the College Football Playoff said it would not reschedule its Dec. 31 semifinal matchups featuring No. 1 Alabama against No. 4 Cincinnati and No. 2 Michigan playing No. 3 Georgia, even as it detailed a protocol that could upend the tournament before kickoff. “As we prepare for the playoff, it’s wise and necessary to put into place additional precautions to protect those who will play and coach the games,” Bill Hancock, the playoff’s executive director, said in a statement. “These policies will better protect our students and staffs while providing clarity in the event worst-case scenarios result.” Under the policies that playoff officials outlined on Wednesday, a team that is unavailable to play in a semifinal game on Dec. 31 will forfeit, allowing its intended opponent to advance automatically to the national title game, which is scheduled for Jan. 10 in Indianapolis. If both teams in one of the semifinal matchups prove unable to compete, the winner of the other semifinal game will be declared the national champion. Texas A&M said its withdrawal from the Gator Bowl came after a surge in cases had left it without enough players. Unless Gator Bowl officials are able to find a replacement team to meet No. 17 Wake Forest, the Dec. 31 game could be the first of this bowl season canceled abruptly because of the pandemic. The flu virus, which all but disappeared in early 2020, is once again circulating in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported about 2,500 cases from clinical tests nationwide for the week that ended Dec. 11. That number is typical for this time of year, but it also represents a level of cases that has not been seen since before the coronavirus pandemic. It is a bad time for the flu to re-emerge, as the Omicron variant causes a surge in coronavirus cases and with travel expected to increase over the holidays. “We have seen how surges in Covid-19 infections can overwhelm hospitals, and influenza infections could further stress health care systems,” said Sonja Olsen, an epidemiologist at the C.D.C. “If both viruses continue to circulate and increase in activity, the situation could get worse.” The agency considers several factors when assessing influenza activity, including the number of overall patients who report respiratory illnesses, the number of long-term care facilities with at least one case of the flu, the share of flu tests that come back positive and the number of flu patients admitted to hospitals. In recent weeks, all of these indicators have gone up. Since early September, the share of flu tests that have come back positive has risen to 3.5 percent from 0.05 percent. That positive rate is still below the prepandemic average, which may mean that there has been less flu in circulation in recent weeks than what was typical in recent years, Dr. Olsen said. WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris was exposed to the coronavirus by a staff member who was close to her throughout the day on Tuesday and later tested positive, the vice president’s spokeswoman said in a statement on Wednesday evening. Ms. Harris tested negative for the coronavirus on Wednesday after learning of the exposure, officials said. She will be tested again on Friday and on Monday, in accordance with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Yesterday, Monday and every day last week, this staff member tested negative for Covid-19,” Symone D. Sanders, the vice president’s spokeswoman, said in a statement. “This staff member is fully vaccinated and boosted and did not experience symptoms. Others who were in close contact with this staff member are being contacted and will be advised to get tested.” White House officials said on Monday that President Biden had also been in close contact with a staff member who later tested positive. Since the encounter, Mr. Biden has tested negative twice, including once on Wednesday morning. In both cases, the White House declined to identify the staff members who had tested positive, citing privacy rules. Officials said neither Mr. Biden nor Ms. Harris were required to quarantine or restrict their activities because both had received negative tests and neither showed symptoms. “The vice president will continue with her daily schedule,” Ms. Sanders wrote. “This evening, she will depart Joint Base Andrews for Los Angeles, where she and the second gentleman will remain through the New Year.” The effort to keep the president and vice president healthy comes as the administration scrambles to confront the rapidly spreading Omicron variant, and as several lawmakers have contracted Covid-19. On Wednesday night, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, announced that he had tested positive but was asymptomatic, while Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, said she too had tested positive after feeling mildly ill. “America is in a new phase of this pandemic,” Mr. Clyburn, 81, said in a Twitter post. “No one is immune.” Risk of exposure to the coronavirus has been a concern at the White House since the beginning of the pandemic. Several senior staff members to President Donald J. Trump became infected last year, and Mr. Trump spent several days in the hospital with the disease. The Biden White House took more precautions. People who enter the White House are required to be vaccinated, and those who interact with the president or the vice president must be tested beforehand. Still, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, became ill with Covid in October, signaling that employees are still vulnerable in the confines of the 18-acre White House complex. Caseloads shattering records almost daily. Hospitalizations creeping upward. New York City residents spending hours in line as they seek coronavirus tests in unprecedented numbers. Just a year ago, a surge in virus cases like the one now coursing through New York would most likely have sent the state into lockdown, with government officials halting indoor dining, closing offices and shuttering schools as they urged residents to stay home. But this week Gov. Kathy Hochul appraised the situation in what is again among the nation’s pre-eminent Covid-19 hot spots, with a record-setting 29,000 new cases reported on Wednesday, and advised vaccinated New Yorkers to remain calm and soldier on. “Our goal is to not let anything shut down,” Ms. Hochul said, urging vaccination and other, more modest, precautions. “Isolation is terrible. It’s just so excruciating what people had to go through last year.” Mayor Bill de Blasio and his imminent successor, Eric Adams, have been just as unequivocal in New York City: “Adamantly, I feel this: No more shutdowns,” Mr. de Blasio said on Tuesday. The difference in tone and policy between now and last December is stark, and Democrats, including Ms. Hochul and President Biden, have been eager to accentuate it. They are seeking to balance managing another huge health challenge with reassuring an anxious public that they are not interested in revisiting polarizing and politically risky lockdowns that could undermine the continuing recovery. “This is not March of 2020,” Ms. Hochul said on Sunday, in a message Mr. Biden echoed. “We are not defenseless.” As people in wealthy nations snap up booster shots amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, the World Health Organization’s leader warned that universal access to extra doses in highly inoculated countries could worsen global vaccine inequality and prolong the pandemic. That imbalance, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.’s director-general, said on Wednesday, will give “the virus more opportunity to spread and mutate.” “It’s important to remember,” he said, “that the vast majority of hospitalizations and deaths are in unvaccinated people, not unboosted people.” Later, he added: “No country can boost its way out of the pandemic.” Since Covid vaccines were developed about a year ago, rich countries have had greater access to them despite global efforts to shrink that disparity. About 73 percent of shots that have gone into arms worldwide have been administered in high- and upper-middle-income countries, according to a New York Times tracker. Only 0.9 percent of doses have been administered in low-income countries. “It’s frankly difficult to understand how a year since the first vaccines were administered, three in four health workers in Africa remain unvaccinated,” Mr. Ghebreyesus said. He did not criticize specific countries by name on Wednesday but did say that “there is no doubt that the inequitable sharing of those vaccines has caused many lives” and questioned “why some countries are now rolling out blanket booster programs.” Governments in Europe and elsewhere are accelerating booster shots as the scientific evidence accumulates that two vaccine doses are insufficient to stop infection from the highly transmissible Omicron variant, though the vaccines appear to reduce the risk of hospitalization and serious illness. Some public health experts who had opposed a boosters-for-all approach have changed their minds since the variant emerged. This week, Israeli leaders said they would offer a fourth round of vaccines to people over 60 and to medical workers. France has shortened the wait before people can receive a booster shot to four months, from five. Britain will offer all eligible adults booster shots by the end of the year, a month earlier than planned. And in the United States, where health officials have recommended booster shots for all adults, the Omicron variant is motivating more than half of vaccinated adults to get a booster shot, according to a recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Although health officials and epidemiologists are urging Americans to get vaccinated and boosted, however, the going has been slow. Just over half of Americans 65 and older — the population most vulnerable to a severe outcome from the virus — have received a booster. Public health experts worry that socioeconomic disparities in U.S. vaccination rates will be exacerbated as booster shots roll out. Difficulty in taking time off work and disconnection from health care systems have contributed to a persistent gap in vaccination rates between the most and least socioeconomically vulnerable counties. Looking ahead to the holiday celebrations, Mr. Ghebreyesus warned that people who have received booster shots should not rely on them as a substitute for other safety measures like wearing masks and avoiding crowded indoor gatherings. “Boosters cannot be seen as a ticket to go ahead with the planned celebrations without the need for other precautions,” he said, adding that the new year “must be the end of the Covid pandemic” as well as “the beginning of something else: a new era of solidarity.”"

Ahora que México ha declarado que el aborto ya no es un delito, Cruz y activistas como ella están planeando llevar su misión a un país que se mueve en la dirección opuesta: Estados Unidos. En Estados Unidos, las restricciones al aborto se han multiplicado durante años, incluso justo al otro lado de la frontera con México, en Texas. Ahora la Corte Suprema está considerando un caso que podría disminuir o anular completamente el caso Roe vs. Wade, la sentencia de 1973 que estableció el derecho constitucional al aborto. Eso probablemente desencadenaría nuevas restricciones en al menos 20 estados. Pero en gran parte de América Latina, donde el acceso al aborto está muy limitado desde hace tiempo, grupos feministas muy organizados distribuyen desde hace años los medicamentos que inducen el aborto, lo que dificulta que los gobiernos apliquen las prohibiciones del procedimiento. Cruz y otras activistas planean ayudar a transportar a México a las mujeres de Texas y otras estadounidenses que quieren abortar. La idea es crear redes para llevar las píldoras abortivas al norte de la frontera o enviarlas por correo, algo que ya han empezado a hacer y que ahora planean ampliar. “No tenemos miedo”, dijo Cruz. “Estamos dispuestas a enfrentar esa criminalización. ¿Por qué? Porque vale más la vida de las mujeres que su ley”. La estrategia es muy polémica, porque implica a activistas extranjeras que trabajan directamente para socavar la legislación estadounidense. También ilustra lo que los activistas de ambos lados del debate sobre el aborto ven como una nueva frontera de la batalla: la capacidad del gobierno para controlar el aborto cuando las mujeres pueden realizarlo en la intimidad de sus hogares, con píldoras que están más disponibles que nunca. El jueves, la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos (FDA, por su sigla en inglés) dijo que los fármacos abortivos pueden entregarse por correo, haciendo permanente una medida promulgada a causa de la pandemia y ampliando el acceso de las mujeres que tienen dificultades para llegar donde un proveedor para interrumpir su embarazo. Pero varios estados prohíben la entrega de estas píldoras por correo, o siguen exigiendo que los medicamentos sean dispensados por los proveedores en persona, además de otras restricciones en su uso. En Texas, una nueva ley prohíbe a los médicos suministrar píldoras para inducir el aborto después de las siete semanas de embarazo, y añade penas de cárcel y una multa de hasta 10.000 dólares para quien envíe por correo o entregue la medicación. Los expertos legales dicen que estas leyes pueden ser impugnadas después de la decisión de la FDA, sin embargo, por ahora, estas medidas estatales podrían disuadir a los médicos estadounidenses de enviar píldoras a partes del país con regulaciones restrictivas. “Por primera vez, Texas tiene una forma de proteger a las mujeres, a través de nuestro derecho penal, de las personas que traen píldoras abortivas peligrosas”, dijo Joe Pojman, director ejecutivo de la Alianza por la Vida de Texas, una organización que ayudó a elaborar la medida. “Tendremos que esperar a ver cómo se aplica en los próximos meses”. Los grupos antiabortistas reconocen que castigar penalmente a las activistas que distribuyen las píldoras, especialmente si son de México, puede resultar difícil. Tendrían que ser atrapadas y detenidas en Texas, o extraditadas, dicen los expertos. “Esto es un ataque realmente terrible y sin ley contra la vida”, dijo John Seago, director legislativo de Texas Right to Life, sobre el plan de las activistas mexicanas para ayudar a las mujeres de Texas a abortar, y añadió que esos esfuerzos “harían absolutamente más difícil hacerlo, hacer cumplir estas leyes”. Rebecca Gomperts, líder de Aid Access, un grupo con sede en Austria que proporciona píldoras abortivas a mujeres de todo el mundo, confirmó que ha estado recetando la medicación a mujeres en Texas —que luego reciben los fármacos por correo desde una farmacia en la India— incluso después de que la ley del estado entrara en vigor este mes. El medicamento misoprostol, creado originalmente para tratar las úlceras de estómago, pero que también induce el aborto, ha cambiado drásticamente el acceso al procedimiento en todo el mundo al ofrecer a las mujeres un método seguro, eficaz y a menudo barato para interrumpir sus embarazos en privado. Tomar el fármaco, solo o en combinación con otro llamado mifepristona, provoca lo que se llama un “aborto con medicamentos”. En toda América Latina, redes de activistas que trabajan al margen del sistema legal entregan las píldoras a las mujeres y las guían en el uso de la medicación para interrumpir el embarazo. Los grupos, a menudo en coordinación con aliados en la comunidad médica, utilizan un modelo que ahora se conoce como “acompañamiento”, en el que distribuyen las píldoras y también proporcionan asesoría médica y apoyo psicológico a las mujeres en una región profundamente católica en la que los abortos suelen ser rechazados y prohibidos. La llegada del misoprostol y la mifepristona fue “revolucionaria”, dijo Giselle Carino, directora ejecutiva de Fòs Feminista, una alianza internacional de grupos de salud. “Pero no habría sido tan eficaz para salvar la vida de las mujeres sin las redes feministas de acompañamiento y los profesionales de la salud dispuestos a participar en la desobediencia civil”. Cruz, la activista mexicana, ayudó a fundar una organización llamada Las Libres en 2000. Empezó a llamar a las puertas de los ginecólogos en su estado, el conservador Guanajuato, pidiéndoles que proporcionaran abortos gratuitos a las víctimas de violaciones. Unos años más tarde, uno de los médicos con los que había estado trabajando volvió de una conferencia con una noticia: había una píldora que podía provocar abortos en casa de forma segura. El misoprostol se puede conseguir sin receta en México, y la Organización Mundial de la Salud tiene un protocolo para administrarlo para realizar abortos en las primeras 12 semanas de embarazo. “Fue cuando supe: ‘nosotras lo vamos a poder resolver’” dijo Cruz. “Entonces no necesitamos a los médicos”. En aquel entonces, las píldoras eran excesivamente caras. Así que, cuenta Cruz, ideó una estrategia: una mujer que pudiera permitirse comprar el medicamento se quedaría con las pastillas sobrantes después de su procedimiento, y luego pasaría la caja a la siguiente mujer que la necesitara, mientras la entrenaba en el proceso. “Y así se fueron creando las primeras redes, orgánicas”, dijo Cruz. El objetivo, dice, nunca fue solo proporcionar abortos. Era convertir a cada mujer mexicana en alguien que pudiera ayudar a otra a abortar. El grupo de empleadas que trabaja con Las Libres tiene cajas de medicamentos, que compran o reciben como donaciones, esparcidas por todas partes: en sus carros, en sus casas, incluso en sus bolsillos. A cada mujer que acude al grupo se le asigna una “acompañante” que le lleva las pastillas y luego la sigue, mediante videollamadas, llamadas telefónicas o mensajes de WhatsApp, en cada paso del aborto. Un estudio reciente sobre más de 900 personas en Nigeria y Argentina, publicado en la revista médica The Lancet, descubrió que acompañar a las pacientes en la gestión de sus propios abortos es “altamente eficaz y seguro”. En el 97 por ciento de las personas encuestadas, el acompañamiento permitió que el aborto fuera completo, es decir, que no se necesitara una intervención quirúrgica de seguimiento para finalizarlo. Para las mujeres que viven bajo estrictas prohibiciones de aborto, también es difícil de detectar. Erika Sandoval, de 23 años, dijo que abortó en su casa este mes en México después de enviar un mensaje de texto a una activista del grupo de Cruz. Consiguió la medicación a través del hermano de la activista, siguió las instrucciones que le llegaron en un mensaje de voz y terminó el proceso dos días después. “Todo esto a partir de un mensaje de voz”, dijo en una entrevista dos días después de tomarse la última píldora. Sofía, también de 23 años, dijo que tomó la medicina en la casa que comparte con sus padres en México, cerrando la puerta de su habitación mientras enviaba mensajes de texto a una mujer del grupo de Cruz. Cuando terminó, dijo, les dijo a sus padres que se había sentido mal después de comer tacos. “Me hicieron sopa de pollo”, dijo. Sus padres nunca se dieron cuenta de lo que había pasado, y Sofía pidió que solo se la identificara por su nombre de pila para que no se enteraran. En septiembre, días después de que Texas comenzara a promulgar una nueva prohibición de los abortos después de las seis semanas de embarazo, la Suprema Corte de Justicia de México dictaminó que el aborto ya no podía ser tratado como un delito. Cruz y sus colegas no tardaron en idear un plan para trabajar con los grupos de salud reproductiva de Texas en la tarea de facilitar a las mujeres del estado la interrupción de sus embarazos en casa. Decenas de activistas se reunieron en enero para elaborar la estrategia. Una de ellas, Crystal P. Lira, dijo que ya ha llevado píldoras de Tijuana a California, y luego las ha enviado a Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts y Texas. Cruz dijo que las nuevas leyes de Texas no les impedirán cruzar la frontera con medicamentos para el aborto, incluso si eso significa arriesgarse a ir a la cárcel. “Si esa es la única forma en la que la gente va a tomar conciencia de que lo que el Estado está haciendo es una violación mayor de derechos humanos”, dijo, entonces “sí”."

The league said on Monday night that it would delay five games that were not already affected by postponements and begin its scheduled holiday break early. It said two games set for Tuesday, however, would be allowed to go ahead. About 12 hours later, though, the league announced one of those games — the Washington’s visit to Philadelphia — was off as well, because of “Covid-related issues” affecting the visitors. Cases among N.H.L. players and their close contacts had already caused nearly four dozen games to be delayed this season. Earlier Monday, several teams, including the Columbus Blue Jackets, Montreal Canadiens and Edmonton Oilers, said they planned to shut down activities before the holiday break. N.H.L. officials, announcing an agreement with the players’ association, said that teams would return to practice on Dec. 26 and that the league planned to resume its schedule on Dec. 27. The suspensions and Tuesday’s postponement mean that 32 planned hockey games will not be played this week, though another game scheduled for Tuesday — Tampa Bay at Las Vegas — will still go ahead. Several major sports leagues have postponed games and adjusted policies amid the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant. The N.H.L., which is considering whether to send players to the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February, on Sunday suspended travel between the United States and Canada for games, citing “the fluid nature of federal travel restrictions.” About 15 percent of the league’s 700-plus players were restricted by coronavirus protocols, The Associated Press reported on Monday. On Sunday, the N.B.A. announced that it would postpone five games. Its players will be tested daily for two weeks starting Dec. 26. England’s Premier League canceled nearly all of its soccer matches over the weekend because rosters were widely depleted by positive cases. The league said in a statement that it would keep its schedule “where safely possible,” even as players were urged to limit social contacts. Some N.H.L. players, though eager to play in the Olympics for the first time since 2014, have expressed misgivings about the burdens of testing protocols and other rules at the Beijing Games. The Swedish goalie Robin Lehner, who plays for the Vegas Golden Knights, said on Twitter that he would not be going to Beijing because of the stress of being locked down and not knowing what would happen if he tested positive. “I’m very disappointed,” he said, adding that it had been a tough decision over a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The extremely contagious Omicron variant is now the dominant version of new coronavirus cases in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and has prompted the resumption of mask mandates in some cities and states in the Northeast, where the growth in new cases has been particularly steep. Omicron, first discovered overseas around Thanksgiving and identified in the U.S. on Dec. 1, now accounts for more than 70 percent of new U.S. cases, according to federal estimates released Monday.  The estimates underscored the rapid spread of the new variant. Two weeks ago, the C.D.C. said Omicron accounted for just 1 percent of U.S. cases; a week ago, it was about 13 percent. Delta, which for months had been the dominant form of the virus, accounted for about 26 percent of new cases over the last week, the C.D.C. estimated. Omicron, discovered thanks to its distinctive combination of more than 50 mutations, has turned out to be highly transmissible — two to three times as likely to spread as Delta — and less susceptible to vaccines than other variants. Early cases raised hopes that it may cause milder disease than other variants, but scientists say more research is needed. In New York, new cases have shot up more than 80 percent over two weeks. In Washington, D.C., where the mayor reinstated an indoor mask mandate on Monday, more than three times as many cases are being identified each day as at the start of December.  In Boston, where cases are also surging, Mayor Michelle Wu on Monday announced proof-of-vaccination requirements for certain indoor spaces like gyms and restaurants. In a news conference on Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City said that the city must “move faster” in its response to the latest wave of new cases, but insisted that another lockdown “would have horrible impacts on the people of this city.” New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, on Monday called the surge in new cases “a vertical increase” because “it is going straight up,” but she did not announce new restrictions. Ms. Hochul, a Democrat, appeared at her daily coronavirus briefing without the state’s health commissioner, Dr. Mary T. Bassett, who tested positive for coronavirus via a rapid test earlier in the day. The tens of thousands of new cases in recent days have included prominent politicians and lawmakers, such as Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, and Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The surge is coming as many hospitals have reached capacity and governors in several states have mobilized the National Guard to help with hospital staffing shortages. As Covid-19 cases crowd into hospitals, leaders of health care facilities in multiple states have taken out newspaper ads begging local residents to get vaccinated. “We need your help,” pleaded the leaders of several health care facilities in Ohio in a full-page ad in Sunday’s edition of the Cleveland Plain-Dealer. “We now have more Covid-19 patients in our hospitals than ever before.” As has been the case throughout the pandemic, the situation has varied around the country, though the overall picture is growing worse by the day. Some states are still struggling with the Delta variant, which had ravaged the South over the summer, while the Omicron variant seems to be driving the surge in the Northeast. Vaccinated people without booster shots are believed to be more vulnerable to infection by Omicron. The six New England states — Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont — have some of the highest vaccination rates in the country, but are nonetheless seeing a worrisome new spike in coronavirus cases. Nearly 11,000 people in the New England states are now testing positive for coronavirus every day, according to a New York Times coronavirus tracker. Almost all of these states have also seen an uptick in the number of hospitalizations and deaths over the past two weeks. Rhode Island, with one of the highest vaccination rates in the country, with 75 percent of people fully vaccinated, is also now the U.S. state with the highest recent average cases per capita, according to the database. Daily cases have increased more than 50 percent over the last two weeks. In response, Gov. Dan McKee announced that indoor establishments will now require masks or proof of vaccination, starting on Monday. The state is also adding more vaccine test sites for people ahead of the holidays. “Now is the time to act,” Mr. McKee said at a Dec. 15 news conference, after describing the current pressure on the state’s hospitals, health care industry and schools. “It is not a time to just sit and wait.” President Biden was in close contact with a White House official who later tested positive for the coronavirus, the administration said on Monday. The president came into contact with the official aboard Air Force One on Friday, spending about 30 minutes near that person during a trip from South Carolina to Pennsylvania, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. The official, who was vaccinated and had received a booster shot, began experiencing symptoms two days later and tested positive on Monday morning. “The president is tested on a regular basis. As part of that regular testing, the president received an antigen test Sunday and tested negative,” Ms. Psaki said. “This morning, after being notified of the staffer’s positive test, the president received a P.C.R. test and tested negative.” She added that Mr. Biden would be tested again on Wednesday, and that as a fully vaccinated person, he was not required to quarantine after exposure. Administration officials acknowledge that as the highly contagious Omicron variant has surged, there have been cases in and around the White House, including the National Security Council, State Department and other agencies. At least one person who traveled with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken on a trip abroad last week tested positive, causing Mr. Blinken to cut his trip short. Tuesday, Dec. 21: This article has been updated to reflect additional statements from L.A. County’s public health department and SpaceX. At least 132 employees at SpaceX’s Southern California headquarters have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent months according to information on outbreaks of the virus posted on a Los Angeles County website. It is the highest number of cases currently reported among private companies in the county. The cases were reported as a wave of infections spread through the country, driven mainly by the Omicron virus variant, and as the private space company founded and led by Elon Musk is conducting a rapid series of rocket launches at sites in California and Florida. However, SpaceX clarified that it does not currently have 132 infected employees on site. About 6,000 employees at the company’s headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif., build and manufacture SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets and Crew Dragon capsules. The rockets are the dominant launch vehicle used by private companies and governments to put satellites in orbit, and the capsules are NASA’s primary vehicle for carrying astronauts to the International Space Station. The company’s mission control room, where engineers are frequently shown during live video streams of launches, seated behind computer monitors wearing masks, is also in Hawthorne. Late on Monday, a spokesman from the Los Angeles County public health department clarified that the 132 infections were reported from July through November. SpaceX broke a company record on Sunday for the quickest turnaround time between two missions, launching a Turkish satellite to space from Kennedy Space Center in Florida just 18 hours after launching 52 of the company’s Starlink internet satellites to orbit on Saturday from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. Another mission from Florida is lifted off Tuesday morning, sending a cargo capsule full of supplies and research to the space station for NASA. A SpaceX spokesman shared an email sent to employees Monday night that said the 132 positive cases had occurred since September. Some cases occurred that month after “several employees who work in the same area contracted COVID outside of work at a non-work-related event.” The company said that because it encouraged employees to be tested at SpaceX headquarters, the company reported positive cases to L.A. county’s public health department.  During an earlier phase of the pandemic, Mr. Musk, SpaceX’s founder and chief executive, balked at restrictions in California meant to curb the spread of the coronavirus. In May last year, Mr. Musk, also the chief executive of Tesla, the electric carmaker, defied a public health order by resuming production at the company’s Fremont factory despite county restrictions that would have prevented employees from working. On the day after Thanksgiving this year, Mr. Musk stoked fears of bankruptcy for SpaceX in emails sent to employees, urging them to work through engineering challenges related to the development of Starship, the company’s next-generation rocket. The pandemic has frequently disrupted spaceflight activities, costing NASA nearly $3 billion from delays, according to an internal report, and a European-Russian mission to Mars had to be postponed until 2022 early in 2020. Nonetheless, SpaceX has sustained its operations throughout the pandemic, including resuming astronaut launches from American soil in May 2020.  Mr. Musk himself tested positive for the virus in November 2020 and was precluded from attending a launch of four astronauts to space for NASA from the Kennedy Space Center. The Broadway production of “Hamilton” canceled all performances until after Christmas as a spike in coronavirus cases batters the performing arts throughout North America as well as in London. The cancellations, prompted by positive coronavirus tests among casts or crew members, come at the worst possible time for many productions, because the holiday season is typically the most lucrative time of year. On Saturday and Sunday, about a third of Broadway shows canceled their performances. And there were multiple Covid-prompted cancellations Off Broadway, as well as in Chicago, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles and other cities. On Monday, the producers for another Broadway show, “Jagged Little Pill,” a rock musical based on the songs of Alanis Morissette, announced it will permanently close. It opened in late 2019 and shut down with the rest of the industry in March 2020 during the early days of the pandemic. The show restarted in October but on Saturday it stopped performing, citing “a limited number of positive Covid test results.”  On Monday night, the producers of “Jagged” said it would not reopen.  “Hamilton,” a sold-out juggernaut that had been the top-grossing show on Broadway, cited breakthrough coronavirus cases in its company as the reason for the cancellation. The show has been dark since Dec. 15 — the matinee went on as scheduled that day, but the evening performance was scrapped — and the first possible next performance is on Dec. 27. The show is the second major Broadway musical to cancel this entire week, following “MJ,” a new musical about Michael Jackson, still in previews, that on Dec. 17 canceled all performances until Dec. 27, citing “multiple positive Covid tests within the company.” Following the “Hamilton” cancellation, a third musical, “Aladdin,” announced that it would be closed through Christmas, and would seek to resume performances on Sunday. The cancellations are now widespread, on Broadway and beyond. In most cases, producers say, the positive coronavirus tests are associated with mild or asymptomatic cases, but the performances are being canceled because there are not enough understudies or replacement workers to substitute for those who must miss the show.  Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York began her coronavirus briefing on Monday by noting that the state’s health commissioner, Dr. Mary Bassett, had tested positive for the virus.  The commissioner is vaccinated, boosted and feeling well, Ms. Hochul said, adding that the initial positive result from a rapid test would be confirmed by a P.C.R. test. Ms. Hochul said that the number of new cases in New York on Monday was a record. She tempered the news about Ms. Bassett by saying that data from other countries were showing the Omicron variant was milder than its predecessor, the Delta variant. But, the governor added, New Yorkers should take precautions nonetheless. “We have to take the steps now to make sure that everybody we love is with us for the next holiday season,” the governor said. Ms. Hochul stressed that the state was in a considerably better position to meet the surge than it had been nearly two years ago, when the pandemic began, and didn’t anticipate any shutdowns. “This is not March 2020,” she said. “It’s not even December of 2020.”  Six million masks are on their way to county executives and hospital bed capacity is rising, with 28 hospitals barred from doing elective surgeries, as opposed to 32 several weeks ago. Currently, the state holds 7,000 ventilators in reserve, she said.  Ms. Hochul also announced that the state would distribute 10 million more free at-home tests in the coming weeks. Of those, officials pledged that one million will go to county emergency managers, 1.6 million will go to New York City, 400,000 will be distributed to vaccine sites, and two million will go to school districts.  The additional supplies are intended to help children remain in school, Ms. Hochul said. “We are keeping our schools open,” she said. “Let me repeat that. We are keeping our schools open.”  Over-the-counter tests have become increasingly scarce in the lead up to the holidays. Kathryn Garcia, the director of state operations, called on the federal government to invoke the Defense Production Act to increase the supply, promising a letter “out the door today.” Officials also offered new details on the at-home testing portal, announced last week. New Yorkers will be able to request P.C.R. tests be delivered to their homes, along with prepaid return postage, said Jackie Bray, the commissioner of the State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, Test results will be available within 48 hours, she said, promising additional details, including a start date, by the end of the week.  Finally, Ms. Hochul announced that $65 million would be available to assist counties in their efforts to enforce the state vaccine-or-mask mandate.  “I want to focus on the counties that are doing the right thing, that have been our allies in making sure that people are compliant with our protocols related to masks and vaccinations,” Ms. Hochul said.  At the event Ms. Hochul once again declined to penalize county executives who have refused to enforce the state’s mandate, citing, among other things, breaches of individual liberty and a lack of resources. Instead, Ms. Hochul said she was focused on removing any impediments for counties seeking to comply. “I have heard from a number of them that while they support what we’re doing with masks and vaccinations, they also need more resources to get this done,” Ms. Hochul said. “I said, ‘OK, we’ve got them for you.’” Former President Donald J. Trump, who for years falsely claimed vaccines were dangerous and pointedly declined to be seen getting vaccinated against Covid-19 while in office, was booed at an event in Dallas after saying publicly for the first time that he had received a booster shot. Mr. Trump was in Texas on Sunday as part of a speaking tour with Bill O’Reilly, the author and former Fox News host, when Mr. O’Reilly said that both he and Mr. Trump “are vaxxed.” Mr. O’Reilly then asked, “Did you get the booster?” “Yes,” Mr. Trump said. “I got it too,” Mr. O’Reilly said. The crowd began to boo, according to a video distributed by one of Mr. O’Reilly’s social media accounts. “Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t,” Mr. Trump said, waving his arm to dismiss the naysayers and downplaying the size of the reaction by pointing to what he said was “a very tiny group over there.”  The exchange comes as the rapidly spreading Omicron variant has fueled a sharp rise in new cases and hospitalizations, with several states mobilizing the National Guard to help with hospital staffing shortages. Omicron is now the dominant version of new coronavirus cases in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vaccinated people without booster shots are believed to be more vulnerable to infection by Omicron, and government officials nationwide say boosters are the best response to the new variant. Just before the booing, Mr. Trump said that his supporters should get vaccinated because, he suggested, unwillingness to do so represented a victory for liberals. “What we’ve done is historic,” he said of the three Covid vaccines in use in the United States that were developed while he was in office. “Don’t let them take away, don’t take it away from ourselves. You’re playing right into their hands when you sort of like, ‘oh, the vaccine.’” He then reiterated his opposition to vaccine mandates, which the Biden administration, localities across the country and many employers have embraced in order to boost vaccination rates. “You shouldn’t be forced to take it, no mandates. But take credit,” Mr. Trump said. Duke University said Monday that it will require students, staff and faculty to receive booster doses of the coronavirus vaccine. The university, one of the first to announce a vaccine mandate last spring, joins a growing list of schools that have issued booster mandates as the Omicron variant spreads rapidly. Wesleyan University in Connecticut was among the first to require boosters, making the announcement in late November. Others have followed, with larger institutions like the University of Michigan and Michigan State declaring mandates in recent days. “It is vital that we take the necessary steps to keep our campus and community safe,” Duke leaders wrote in an email to campus. Effective immediately, “all students and employees to provide proof of receiving the COVID-19 booster shot in January or as soon as they are eligible.” More than 20,000 faculty and staff and nearly 4,000 students at Duke have already received their booster shots, according to the university. But the total enrollment of graduate and undergraduate students at the school typically hovers around 16,000 each year. “For those who have not already done so,” Duke leaders wrote, “we strongly encourage you to get your booster shot as soon as you are eligible.” In a news conference, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper addressed the state’s rising cases — reporting over 10,500 new cases since Friday and 1,630 in the hospital with Covid-19. Dr. Mandy Cohen, the secretary health and human services in North Carolina, warned that the state “will likely set record high daily case numbers in the coming weeks.” Omicron has already disrupted campus life around the Northeast and Upper Midwest, as prominent universities like N.Y.U., Cornell and Princeton have gone remote for the last few weeks of the semester. Dozens of passengers and crew members aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise ship tested positive for the coronavirus last week, according to the cruise line. Royal Caribbean International said in a statement that the ship, the Symphony of the Seas, was carrying more than 6,000 guests and crew members when 48 people onboard tested positive. The ship departed on Dec. 11 for a seven-night Caribbean cruise and returned to port in Miami on Saturday, the company said. The cases were identified because of contact tracing after a guest tested positive, the cruise line said. “Each person quickly went into quarantine,” the statement said. “Everyone who tested positive was asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and we continuously monitored their health.” The cruise line said that the ship sailed with 95 percent of its guests aboard fully vaccinated and that 98 percent of the people who tested positive were fully vaccinated. It was not immediately clear whether any of the people who tested positive had received a booster shot of a Covid-19 vaccine. Royal Caribbean requires travelers 12 and older to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and test negative before boarding the ship. Children who are not yet vaccinated must provide a negative P.C.R. test result before sailing and test negative at the terminal before boarding. The company said that all its crew members were full vaccinated against Covid-19 and were tested weekly. During the early days of the pandemic in 2020, outbreaks on cruise ships sickened hundreds of people and upended the tourism industry, as officials and companies struggled to keep crews and passengers safe. For months, cruise ships were barred from sailing to many ports. Even after vaccinations became more widely available in the United States in April, allowing much of the travel industry to ramp up again, cruise ships remained docked in ports, costing the industry billions of dollars each month. The cruise industry rebounded in the summer, with many companies reporting an increase in bookings and a better handle on Covid-19 protocols. But a recent spike in coronavirus cases in parts of the United States and Europe and growing concerns over the Omicron variant may hinder that momentum. This month, at least 17 coronavirus cases were identified on a Norwegian Breakaway cruise ship that docked in New Orleans, including a case of the new Omicron variant. The New York Police Department issued new guidance late Sunday night requiring all employees to once again wear face masks indoors and outdoors when interacting with the public, whether they are vaccinated or not. The guidance, sent out in an email, says that “regardless of vaccination status,” members of the Police Department are required to wear face coverings in communal office settings, in meetings, and both indoors and outdoors when interacting with the public. Under an earlier policy issued this summer, fully vaccinated members of the force were permitted to remove their masks in certain situations, though all officers, regardless of vaccination status, were supposed to remain masked when interacting with the public. The change comes as coronavirus cases skyrocket in the city and state amid the spread of the Omicron variant, just as the holiday season approaches. The new mask policy is the latest shift in guidance for a department whose staff has bucked coronavirus protocols for nearly two years. N.Y.P.D. officers have been recorded refusing to wear masks and harassing people who tell them to put them on. They have repeatedly disregarded guidance for masking while interacting with the public. Some of these incidents have occurred on public transit, where everyone, police officers included, has been required to wear a mask since last spring, regardless of vaccination status. For the better part of the city’s vaccine rollout, the Police Department’s vaccination rate lagged significantly behind that of almost every other city agency. After City Hall announced a vaccine mandate for city employees this fall, the department’s vaccination rate rose to around 88 percent, according to a department spokesperson. Five days before a Christmas that many hoped would mark a return to normal, governments across Europe were instead considering new social restrictions and tougher rules to protect their health systems from another potentially devastating coronavirus wave. In Britain, where new infections driven by the fast-spreading Omicron variant have reached their highest levels of the pandemic, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday described an “extremely difficult” surge of hospitalizations in London and said he was “looking at all kinds of things to keep Omicron under control.” In Germany, where experts warned that more health workers are testing positive and I.C.U.s and emergency rooms are reaching capacity, government leaders were scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss imposing stricter curbs on gatherings before New Year’s Eve. “We should be careful about ruling anything out,” Hendrik Wüst, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, told the broadcaster ARD, adding: “The big New Year’s Eve parties won’t be able to take place this year.” The rapid surge of Omicron, less than a month after it was first identified, has confronted European nations with the prospect of a second consecutive Christmas clouded by lockdown-like measures, travel bans and fears of rationed health care. Governments are rapidly accelerating booster shots as the scientific evidence accumulates that two vaccine doses are insufficient to stop infections. Even though researchers still don’t know whether Omicron causes severe illness in most people, its rapid spread in Britain and Denmark — two countries with high vaccination rates and high levels of disease surveillance — has alarmed the continent. Researchers in Denmark, where nearly 77 percent of people have had two vaccine doses, found last week that Omicron cases were doubling every two days, and that the variant was mostly infecting people who had been fully vaccinated. The tiny Scandinavian nation is now recording more than 9,000 new cases daily, one of the highest per-person infection rates in the world. In Britain, the variant has become the dominant strain of the virus in London, where experts say cases are doubling every two days. In London hospitals, the number of Covid patients rose by 30 percent last week, according to Chris Hopson, the chief of N.H.S. Providers, the membership organization for England’s National Health Service staff. Infections were also cutting into the number of health care providers; staff absences attributed to Covid-19 more than doubled last week, he added, forcing some health facilities to “postpone nonessential activity.” Concerns over the effect on health systems are part of the reason that the Netherlands over the weekend announced a lockdown, even though the country’s new case totals have fallen from their late November peak, when most cases were of the Delta variant. On Saturday, Prime Minister Mark Rutte ordered the closure of all but essential businesses until the second week of January and limited the number of guests allowed into people’s homes. Acknowledging that the measures meant “another Christmas that is completely different from what we would like,” Mr. Rutte said that the lockdown was necessary to prevent “an unmanageable situation in hospitals.” The Netherlands has less I.C.U. capacity than many wealthy European nations, with 6.7 beds per 100,000 people, compared with 19 in France and 14 in the United States, according to the Our World in Data Project at the University of Oxford. Officials say that occupancy rates at hospitals are already high, and experts warn that nurses are being stretched thin. “The burnout is huge,” said Dr. Mark Seubert, a critical-care physician in the Netherlands. “You see more people leaving the health care sector than joining it.” Rafael Nadal, the Spanish tennis star, announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus in Spain on Monday after returning from an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi. Nadal, a former No. 1 and one of the greatest players in the sport’s long history, shares the men’s record with 20 Grand Slam singles titles. But because he missed most of the second half of the 2021 season because of a chronic problem with his left foot, he played only 29 matches. His positive test casts doubt on whether he will return to the circuit next month for the Australian Open, the first Grand Slam tournament of 2022. “I am having some unpleasant moments but am counting on feeling better bit by bit,” he said in a post on Twitter in Spanish on Monday. He added: “As a consequence of the situation, I have to maintain total flexibility with my schedule, and I will analyze my options depending on how my situation evolves.” Nadal said he had taken a P.C.R. test after returning to Spain from Abu Dhabi and was now confined to his home in Manacor on the Spanish island of Majorca. He said he had informed all those with whom he had been in close contact about his test result, including his wife, his sister, his father, his physical therapist and two of his coaches, Carlos Moyá and Marc López, according to El País, a Spanish newspaper. The list of close contacts also presumably included Nadal’s two opponents in the Abu Dhabi exhibition: Andy Murray and Denis Shapovalov, both of whom defeated Nadal. Juan Carlos, the former king of Spain, attended Nadal’s match with Murray on Friday and met on Saturday with Nadal and Moyá, according to the Spanish newspaper El Mundo. Nadal is the latest tennis star to contract the coronavirus. Top-ranked Novak Djokovic tested positive for it in 2020. Second-ranked Daniil Medvedev did so earlier this year, as did Carlos Alcaraz, Nadal’s talented 18-year-old Spanish compatriot, who was forced to miss the Davis Cup finals in Madrid this month. Leading women who have tested positive include second-ranked Aryna Sabalenka; a former U.S. Open champion, Bianca Andreescu; and Coco Gauff, the rising American 17-year-old who was unvaccinated at the time of her positive test and had to withdraw from the Summer Olympics. Unlike Djokovic, who has not revealed his vaccination status, Nadal has been an advocate for vaccinations and said he would comply with the coming Australian Open’s decision to require players to be vaccinated. “If the people who really know about it say that we need to be vaccinated, who am I to create a different opinion?” he said in Abu Dhabi last week. Nadal said on Monday that he had taken coronavirus tests “every two days” during his visit to Abu Dhabi and to Kuwait, where he has a tennis academy. “All the tests were negative,” Nadal said. “The last was on Friday, and we got the results on Saturday.” Nadal, ranked No. 6 after his abbreviated 2021 season, had to withdraw from Wimbledon, the Summer Olympics and the U.S. Open this year because of Müller-Weiss disease, a congenital foot condition that first troubled him in his early 20s but which he has long been able to manage with custom insoles and therapy. Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland announced on Monday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, despite being fully vaccinated and having received a booster shot.  “This morning, as part of my regular testing routine, I received a positive rapid test for Covid-19,” Mr. Hogan, a Republican, wrote on Twitter. “I have been vaccinated and boosted, and I am feeling fine at the moment.” Maryland is facing a surge of cases — with the seven-day average of hospitalizations rising to 1,474 as of Sunday, according to a New York Times database. That number is up 52 percent over the past two weeks, and led the governor to expand hospital capacity and limit elective surgeries. But Mr. Hogan reinforced late last week and on Sunday that he will not enforce any new lockdowns or mandates.  Appearing in studio with Bret Baier on the program “Fox News Sunday,” the governor said that the state is “trying to do everything we can” to get the remainder of the state vaccinated — save for more mandates. “We are not anticipating any lockdowns at all,” he said. “We are not considering them.” But the state’s increase was troubling, Mr. Hogan said. And in light of his positive test, Mr. Hogan again encouraged residents to get vaccinated or schedule a booster dose as the Omicron variant gains dominance in the state. A spokesperson for Fox News said the network is “following all Covid-19 protocols and procedures,” and said that Bret Baier will be anchoring his show from a remote studio following the exposure. Mr. Hogan’s announcement follows a number of government officials, also fully vaccinated and boosted, who report that they have tested positive for the coronavirus. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey announced breakthrough infections via Twitter on Sunday, as did Representative Jason Crow of Colorado.  “Thankfully, I am only experiencing mild symptoms & am grateful for the protection provided against serious illness that comes from being vaccinated & boosted,” Ms. Warren wrote on Twitter. The Cathedral of St. John the Divine, a landmark house of worship in Manhattan and the seat of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, said on Monday that it would move all of its religious services online. “Today, the city, nation, and world are once again facing a coronavirus surge, this time driven by the newly emergent omicron variant,” Isadora Wilkenfeld, the director of Cathedral programming and communications, said in an email. “As the Cathedral has done before, placing the needs and concerns of the wider community first is crucial.” The move makes the cathedral the first major house of worship in New York to cancel in-person services before Christmas, which is typically one of the most well-attended services of the year for most Christian denominations. The decision applies to services on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, its concert on New Year’s Eve, as well as regular weekday and weekend services “until further notice,” Ms. Wilkenfeld said. Other denominations in New York have so far resisted making any significant changes to their holiday schedules. Spokesmen for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and the Diocese of Brooklyn said they planned to make no changes to the Christmas schedule or to take further precautions than those they had been following. Safety measures have included not making the sign of peace at Mass, not distributing communion wine, and keeping holy water fonts dry. Parish priests have also been instructed to inform parishioners that they are required to wear masks during Mass. “These measures have been working and effective,” said Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York. “There are no additional measures being put in place at this time.” New York State has reported a growing number of new cases every day for the last three days, for a total of more than 60,000 new infections. On Sunday, it reported 22,478 new cases, although most appeared to be more mild than in the city’s brutal first wave. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat with less than a two weeks left in office, announced 5,731 new cases in New York City on Sunday. That is a significant increase from the rates in early November, when fewer than 1,000 cases were reported each day. But Mr. de Blasio has not indicated so far that he will introduce the kind of public health restrictions that saw houses of worship shuttered entirely for months in 2020. “Another shutdown would have horrible impacts on the people of this city,” he said at a televised news conference on Monday. Connecticut is rolling out a digital passport program for state residents. The SMART Health Card, similar to New York’s Excelsior Pass, will let residents show their vaccination status. The software, which was made available on the state’s website last week, can be downloaded in the form of a QR code onto a phone. While there are no state mandates requiring that businesses ask for proof of vaccination, some restaurants, theaters and other entertainment venues are doing so. “The SMART Heath Card is purely optional and voluntary,” Gov. Ned Lamont said at a Monday news conference. “It’s an added convenience, and it’s secure.” Mr. Lamont said neighboring states, including Massachusetts and Rhode Island, will also be introducing digital passports in the near future. “It’ll make it easier for our restaurants, and stores, and businesses, just to give them an option of showing that you’re vaccinated, and that you’re safe,” Mr. Lamont said. Connecticut, which has a 74 percent vaccination rate — one of the highest in the country, according to The New York Times’s coronavirus tracker — is dealing with a recent uptick in cases. More than 2,300 people are testing positive every day, a 137 percent increase over the last two weeks. On Dec. 4, Connecticut reached another grim milestone: its first confirmed Covid-19 case with the new and highly contagious Omicron variant. “It’s a little frustrating, I’ve got to admit,” Mr. Lamont said. “We were the most vaccinated, least infected state in the country, going back a couple of months. What happened? I thought vaccinations meant we were bulletproof? Well, not quite.” Fox Corporation, the owner of Fox News, told employees on Friday that those working in New York City would have to show proof they’d had at least one dose of the Covid vaccine by Dec. 27, removing the option to get tested weekly instead. The new policy was in keeping with New York City’s vaccine rule, which Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in early December and which is more stringent than a contested Biden administration rule requiring vaccine mandates or weekly testing at larger employers. The New York City mandate, which requires on-site workers at all businesses to be vaccinated, is the country’s most sweeping local vaccine mandate and affects some 184,000 businesses. “Our policy reflects the guidelines of the mandate,” a spokesman for Fox Corporation said in an email on Monday. More than 90 percent of Fox’s employees are vaccinated, the company said. New York is facing a surge of coronavirus cases. On Friday, the state reported 21,027 new coronavirus cases, the highest single-day total since early in the pandemic, when testing was not as widely available. New York’s mandate for workplaces requires that recipients of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines receive a second dose, but the policy does not currently require booster shots. The European Commission on Monday authorized a Covid-19 vaccine made by Novavax, making it the fifth vaccine available in the 27 nations of the European Union. “At a time where the Omicron variant is rapidly spreading, and where we need to step up vaccination and the administration of boosters, I am particularly pleased with today’s authorization of the Novavax vaccine,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a statement. It’s not yet clear how well the vaccine, known as Nuvaxovid, will work against the contagious new Omicron variant. And there may not be much demand for the new vaccine in Europe, which is already flush with vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and other sources. Novavax, based in Maryland, last year won $1.7 billion in support from the United States government to develop a vaccine made of proteins from the coronavirus. Despite the lavish support, Novavax lagged behind the vaccine developers Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna and struggled with its clinical trials and manufacturing. Eventually, however, Novavax demonstrated that its vaccine could offer strong protection. In a final report published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine, company researchers found that Nuvaxovid was 90 percent effective against symptomatic infection with Covid-19 and 100 percent effective against moderate to severe disease. Protein-based vaccines have been used for decades and generally have a strong track record of safety and mild side effects. Nuvaxovid’s side effects are usually mild or moderate and clear up within a couple days. Novavax teamed up with the Serum Institute of India as a manufacturing partner, and in recent weeks the new vaccine has enjoyed a string of regulatory successes. Indonesia and the Philippines authorized the vaccine last month. The World Health Organization last week granted to Nuvaxovid an emergency-use listing, a seal of approval that accelerates the adoption of vaccines in countries that cannot conduct large-scale reviews of their own. The symptoms of the common cold are typically a stuffy head, the sniffles and body aches. Now, this season, there’s a new one: panic. As the latest coronavirus variant races through recently reopened offices, holiday parties and family gatherings, signs of an ailment that was once an annoying winter perennial eased with bed rest and chicken soup now set minds racing. In New York City, the slightest sniffle has people canceling holiday plans and packing coronavirus testing centers, where in recent days lines have stretched for blocks. Is it a cold? Or is it Covid? The World Economic Forum said Monday that it was postponing its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, citing concerns over the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. The cancellation of the event, which had been planned for Jan. 17-21, is one of the biggest disruptions caused by the new wave of coronavirus cases, and upends plans for the many world leaders and corporations that had planned to attend. As recently as Thursday, the World Economic Forum had said it was proceeding with the event, which draws thousands of politicians, executives and nonprofit leaders to a ritzy ski town in the Swiss Alps for lectures, panel discussions, dinners and parties. Organizers had said they would make a decision about whether to proceed by Jan. 6. But with Omicron cases surging worldwide, the meeting was “deferred” on Monday and tentatively rescheduled for the summer. “Current pandemic conditions make it extremely difficult to deliver a global in-person meeting,” Adrian Monck, a spokesman for the event, said in an email announcing the cancellation. “Despite the meeting’s stringent health protocols, the transmissibility of Omicron and its impact on travel and mobility have made deferral necessary.” The move suggests new uncertainties for business travel, yet another headache for chief executives, and raises the prospect that more major events could be canceled or postponed in the weeks ahead."

But a little over a month later, the Labor Department’s vaccine rule has been swept into confusion and uncertainty by legal battles, shifting deadlines and rising Covid case counts that throw the very definition of fully vaccinated into question. The spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant has seemingly bolstered the government’s argument, at the heart of its legal battle over the rule, that the virus remains a grave threat to workers. But the recent surge in cases has raised the issue of whether the government will take its requirements further — even as the original rule remains contentious — and ask employers to mandate booster shots, too. The country’s testing capacity has also been strained, adding to concerns that companies will be unable to meet the rule’s testing requirements."

The standards on Kelly Clarkson’s second Christmas album are almost unfair to other interpreters — she is that nimble a singer. (See “Last Christmas,” especially, rendered here as a vivid roller coaster.) However, it’s Clarkson’s originals — which she sings with the kind of verve most singers not named Mariah Carey don’t bother putting into their holiday releases — that make “When Christmas Comes Around …” truly stand out. “Santa, Can’t You Hear Me” with Ariana Grande is pure Motown, and “Glow” with Chris Stapleton is a worthy howl-off between two powerhouse vocalists. It’s also striking just how uncelebratory some of these songs are: “Merry Christmas (to the One I Used to Know)” is haunting; “Christmas Isn’t Canceled (Just You)” is a blissful tsk-tsk; and “Merry Christmas Baby,” about sloughing off a deadbeat partner, is deliciously icy: “Have yourself a merry Christmas/Hope it’s not as cold as you.” JON CARAMANICA"

So what should you do if you’re one of them? We spoke to physicians and infectious disease experts about the steps you should take after a positive test or if you find out you’ve been in close contact with an infected person. Here’s their advice. If you’re in public or around people when you get the bad news, put on a mask immediately. Then isolate yourself as quickly as possible, even if you don’t have symptoms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends isolating for at least five full days, followed by five days of wearing a mask around others, as long as you don’t have a fever and any other symptoms are improving. If you are seriously ill with Covid or have a weakened immune system, the C.D.C. recommends an isolation period of 10 to 20 days. If you have a fever, the agency advises you to stay home until the fever resolves. Read more about the new C.D.C. guidelines. If you are waiting for test results but have symptoms of Covid-19, the C.D.C. now recommends that you isolate anyway, regardless of vaccination status. If you live with roommates or family, try to separate yourself from other people (and animals) as much as possible. “You should take yourself out of society,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco. “Wall yourself up in a cocoon.” Isolating in a home with other people may be difficult, but do the best you can. That means staying in your room, away from other members of the household, even for meals. Someone should deliver food to your bedroom door if possible. If the home has more than one bathroom, designate one just for the infected person. If the infected person is a child or older person who needs assistance, both the caregiver and the infected person should wear a mask when the caregiver enters the room, and open the windows if possible. If others are in the house, always wear a high-quality mask when you leave your room. Everyone should mask up in shared spaces. After using a shared bathroom, disinfect the toilet seat and handle, as well as the faucet handles, soap dispenser, counter and light switch. Close the lid before you flush, and turn on the exhaust fan. Open windows to improve ventilation in shared areas. The people living in your household should take precautions, but they don’t need to panic about getting infected too, especially if they’re vaccinated and boosted. “The household rate of contracting Covid from someone is not 100 percent by a long shot, even with the more transmissible variants,” said Dr. Paul Sax, an infectious disease expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School. While it can help incrementally to continue to wipe down shared spaces, “the most important thing is keeping people from breathing air that is filled with germs,” said Tara Kirk Sell, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. If you have a HEPA air cleaner, place it in or outside your bedroom. If you’ve tested positive and feel well, you can take a walk outdoors and get fresh air. If you’re in a city where you will cross paths with other people, wear a mask and keep your distance. If you tested positive after taking a rapid home test, you may want to take a second home test using a different brand or go to a testing center to confirm the result. False positives aren’t common with home tests, but they can happen. Even so, you should assume the positive result is correct, wear a mask and avoid close contact with other people until you get retested. If your positive test came from a laboratory, a second test isn’t necessary. If you receive a negative test on your rapid home test, don’t use that as your sole basis for decision making. The C.D.C. advises that a negative result on a rapid home test does not rule out a Covid infection. To improve the results from an antigen test, the agency recommends testing twice over a three-day period with at least 24 hours and no more than 48 hours between tests. No. In most cases, you won’t know which variant of coronavirus you’ve caught and your lab test typically won’t tell you. In general, the guidance on isolation, monitoring and treatment does not change based on which variant infected you. Think about where you’ve been and who might have inhaled your germs. Contact your employer and let them know. Most workplaces have protocols in place for contact tracing when an employee tests positive. You also want to alert anyone with whom you’ve spent time, going back at least two days before you got tested or started having symptoms, said Dr. Sax. The C.D.C. defines a close contact as someone who was less than six feet from you for 15 minutes or more. It may feel overwhelming, or even shameful, to tell people about your positive test, said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. “A lot of people think it’s some failure if you get infected,” Dr. Jha said. “This is an incredibly contagious variant. A lot of people are going to get it. That is not a moral failure.” Don’t forget to tell your doctor too, particularly if you have an underlying medical condition, like high blood pressure or diabetes, that puts you at higher risk. If the infected person is a child, call your pediatrician. You also need to call your child’s school, as well as anyone they’ve had close contact with at play dates, parties or other activities. Monitor your symptoms. You can use a pulse oximeter to keep track of your blood oxygen levels. Most healthy people will get an oxygen reading around 95 to 99 percent. You should seek medical advice if the reading drops quickly or the level dips to 93 percent or lower. The devices can be less accurate for people with darker skin, so pay attention to the trend. If your reading drops by four points, it’s worth checking in with a doctor. You should also see a doctor if you take a turn for the worse, have trouble breathing or have any symptom that causes you concern. You can learn more in our story, Why Days 5 to 10 Are So Important When You Have Coronavirus. Ask your doctor if you are eligible for monoclonal antibodies, a treatment that can help your body fight Covid-19 and lower your risk for severe illness, particularly for people in a high-risk group. For monoclonal antibody therapy to be most effective, it needs to be given soon after diagnosis, even if you’re not feeling bad yet. If you don’t have a regular doctor, you can also contact the infectious disease clinic at your hospital and ask about the treatment, said Dr. Celine Gounder, an epidemiologist at N.Y.U. medical school. Only one monoclonal antibody treatment, sotrovimab made by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology, has performed well against Omicron in laboratory experiments. Although the supply of sotrovimab is very limited, the Biden administration is in talks with GlaxoSmithKline about securing more doses to be delivered by early next year. The Food and Drug Administration has authorized two different oral treatments for people who are vulnerable to becoming severely ill because they are older or have medical conditions such as obesity or diabetes. Paxlovid, developed by Pfizer, is authorized for high-risk patients age 12 and older, and is meant to be taken as 30 pills over five days. Another pill treatment from Merck, known as molnupiravir, has been authorized for people 18 and older, and is meant to be taken as 40 pills over five days. To calculate your five-day isolation period, count your first day of symptoms as Day 0. If you never had symptoms but have a confirmed positive test, count Day 0 as the day you tested. You can leave isolation after five days if you don’t have a fever and any symptoms you had are getting better. If your symptoms persist or get worse, if you are immunocompromised or are severely ill with Covid, consult with your health care provider about when to leave isolation, which may last between 10 and 20 days. After isolation, the C.D.C. advises that you keep wearing a mask around others for an additional five days. Don’t remove your mask to eat or drink around other people, don’t travel and don’t spend time around high risk people until the masking period has ended. Although the agency didn’t recommend testing after isolation, the new guidelines say people should take a rapid antigen test after the five day isolation period if they have “access to a test and want to test.” Vaccinated adults who had booster shots and fully vaccinated children don’t need to quarantine after a potential exposure, but they should get tested five days later and wear masks around other people for 10 days.  People who are unvaccinated should quarantine for five days after exposure and then get tested. Wear masks around other people for 10 days. This also applies to people who are eligible for booster shots but have not received them yet. The C.D.C. has said that unvaccinated students who are exposed to the virus do not need to miss school after a potential exposure as long as two tests taken during the next week are negative. Read more about the “test to stay” protocol. Yes. The degree of protection you get from a previous infection varies widely. You’re more protected if you’ve also been vaccinated. Early studies suggest antibodies from a past Covid infection alone are not a strong defense against Omicron. “Unfortunately, reinfection after people have had Covid before, can occur, and the protection of previous infections is very variable and unpredictable,” said Dr. David Rubin, the director of PolicyLab at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. “So some people seem to be very protected and don’t get Covid again, and other people can get it again and even get quite severe disease again.”"

Mr. de Blasio said Sunday that he was in talks with the sponsors of the gathering, but noted that the event was outside and required proof of vaccination. He promised to have a decision one way or the other before Christmas. Over the past week, New York has reported record-breaking levels of cases. On Sunday, New York State reported 22,478 new cases for more than 60,000 over the past three days, each a record. While the numbers are exceeding the city’s first brutal wave, the true toll of the pandemic’s early days will never be known because tests were in such short supply then. The mayor announced 5,731 new cases in New York City on Sunday. By comparison, the city was averaging fewer than 1,000 daily cases in early November. The surge in coronavirus cases has caused a cascade of cancellations of holiday gatherings and return-to-office plans. Several Broadway shows have had to cancel at the last minute after cast members tested positive. Today the mayor canceled an annual holiday reception at Gracie Mansion for the City Hall press corps — the last of his administration. The Omicron variant will produce a short but intense spike in coronavirus infections in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio predicted, suggesting that it would last “a matter of weeks.” “We expect Omicron to be a fast and temporary phenomenon,” the mayor said at a news conference that included Mayor-elect Eric Adams. “We expect these next weeks to see a very, very big surge in the number of cases, more than we’ve seen previously, then we expect after a period of time, that it will dissipate.” Mr. de Blasio said that New York was in a strong position to fight this new wave, but stressed that vaccination and testing would remain paramount. As a part of its effort to expand testing, the city says it is distributing at-home tests at city-run test sites and through community organizations. Officials also said they would add 17 new mobile testing sites, bringing the total of those sites to more than 90 by Tuesday. “This is a brand-new reality, but the good news is the city has been through so many versions of Covid challenges that we can adjust rapidly,” Mr. de Blasio said, adding that the city was not having any issues budgeting for its Covid response. Still, the mayor appealed to the federal government for assistance, asking the Biden administration to invoke the Defense Production Act to expand the stock of test kits and vaccine supplies. He also pressed for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to make additional supplies of monoclonal antibodies available, and for the Food and Drug Administration to expedite approval of a new Pfizer antiviral medication. In an effort to expand booster rates among vulnerable older people, Dr. Dave Chokshi, the city health commissioner, said that the city would help coordinate access for nursing home residents and staff, deploying vaccination teams if necessary. He said a new program to encourage vaccination among children would allow pediatricians to be reimbursed by Medicaid for vaccine consultations with young children and their parents. Mayor-elect Adams struck an empathetic note in addressing New Yorkers exhausted by nearly two years of pandemic. “I know many of you are tired. You want to return to normalcy. You want the city you love back,” he said. “So do I. But the only way we get our city back is to find our resolve once again and face this crisis head on.” Two prominent Democratic senators, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, announced separately on Sunday that they had tested positive with a breakthrough case of the coronavirus. Both senators disclosed their cases on Sunday, and said they were experiencing mild symptoms after being vaccinated and receiving a booster shot. Ms. Warren said she received the positive result Sunday, while Mr. Booker said his test result came back after he began experiencing symptoms Saturday. News of the cases came barely a day after the Senate left Washington for the year and ahead of a planned address by President Biden to the nation on Tuesday to respond to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. Both senators called on the public to get vaccinated. “I urge everyone who has not already done so to get the vaccine and the booster as soon as possible — together, we can save lives,” Ms. Warren wrote on Twitter, adding that she had received both a vaccine and a booster shot. “I’m certain that without them I would be doing much worse,” Mr. Booker said in a statement. “I encourage everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated and boosted.” President Biden will address Americans on Tuesday as his administration faces questions about how it will respond to the challenges of a pandemic that has persisted well beyond the administration’s expectations. Mr. Biden “will announce new steps the Administration is taking to help communities in need of assistance,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, wrote on Twitter on Saturday, “while also issuing a stark warning of what the winter will look like for Americans that choose to remain unvaccinated.” Mr. Biden has both sounded an alarm over Omicron this month while also expressing optimism that the fast-spreading variant would not set back the progress the country has made. For the unvaccinated, the president said on Thursday, “we are looking at a winter of severe illness and death — if you’re unvaccinated — for themselves, their families, and the hospitals they’ll soon overwhelm. But there’s good news: If you’re vaccinated and you had your booster shot, you’re protected from severe illness and death — period.” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, warned on Sunday that the extraordinarily contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus was raging worldwide and that it was likely to cause another major surge in the United States, especially among the unvaccinated.  “This virus is extraordinary,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” referring to the new variant. But as Americans wrestle this week with whether to curtail holiday gatherings and travel plans, Dr. Fauci said that adhering to the available preventive tools should protect most. “If you’re vaccinated and you’re boosted, and you take care when you go into congregate settings like airports to make sure you continually wear your mask, you should be OK,” Dr. Fauci said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” He urged air travelers to remain masked during flights. Christmas 2021 need not be a replay of Christmas 2020, he said. He encouraged even boosted people to get tested if they plan to attend celebrations indoors and to try to avoid gatherings if they were unsure that whether all the guests were vaccinated. “We are doing better if you look now compared to where we were a year ago,” Dr. Fauci said on CNN. “We now have multiple at-home tests available, and we virtually had none a year ago. But we do need to do better.” While at-home tests are more widespread, they have been scarce in certain areas that are struggling to keep up with demand.  Still, with 50 million eligible Americans unvaccinated against Covid, the coming six to eight weeks of winter seem poised to bring an uptick in cases, deaths, overwhelmed hospitals and commensurately exhausted health care workers, particularly in regions where vaccination rates are low, he said. He made a fervent plea for people who had received two doses of a Covid vaccine to get a booster as soon as they are eligible, which would substantially strengthen their resistance to the Omicron variant.  He also said that breakthrough infections among the vaccinated would continue to occur. Dr. Francis Collins, who was in his final day as director of the National Institutes of Health, expressed exasperation with those who claim that breakthrough infections indicate that the vaccines don’t work. Vaccines are not perfect, he said on Fox News Sunday. But if people get Covid after being vaccinated, he said: “The chances are you’re going to have a pretty mild case. You’ll have the sniffles, maybe are sick for a day or two with a fever, but you won’t be in the I.C.U. The vaccinations are really good at protecting against severe disease.” The N.B.A. postponed two Nets games on Sunday in a new wave of schedule changes as a coronavirus outbreak swept through the league. The Nets’ home games against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday and the Washington Wizards on Tuesday were postponed, as were Sunday’s games for Cleveland at Atlanta and New Orleans at Philadelphia. A Monday game between Orlando and Toronto was also postponed, bringing to seven the total number of coronavirus-related postponements this season. The N.B.A. has not said when the games will be made up. Last season, more than 30 games were postponed at least in part because of the virus. Dozens of players have entered the N.B.A.’s health and safety protocols over the past two weeks, meaning they have tested positive for the coronavirus or been exposed to someone who has. Generally, players must isolate for 10 days or return two negative tests 24 hours apart to return to play. The league and players’ union plan to increase testing after Christmas Day in response to the outbreak, but have not indicated that they are considering pausing the season. More than 95 percent of N.B.A. players have been vaccinated, according to the league and players’ union. Also on Sunday, the N.H.L. announced that “due to the concern about cross-border travel and, given the fluid nature of federal travel restrictions,” it would postpone 21 games slated for Monday through Dec. 23 and which pitted Canadian against U.S.-based teams. Those games are scheduled to resume on Dec. 27. And the N.F.L. and N.F.L. Players Association on Saturday made a change to its testing protocols, the fourth such adjustment in a week. The N.B.A.’s current outbreak has affected stars and teams across the league, including some scheduled to play during the league’s marquee slate of five games on Christmas. A Nets-Lakers matchup is a part of that slate, but nine Nets players — including Kevin Durant and James Harden — are being held out of games and practices for virus reasons. A growing body of preliminary research suggests that the Covid-19 vaccines used in most of the world offer almost no defense against becoming infected by the highly contagious Omicron variant. All vaccines approved in the United States still seem to provide a significant degree of protection against serious illness from Omicron, which is the most crucial goal. But only the Pfizer and Moderna shots, when reinforced by a booster, appear to have success at stopping infections, and these vaccines are unavailable in most of the world. The other shots — including those from AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and vaccines manufactured in China and Russia — do little to nothing to stop the spread of Omicron, early research shows. And because most countries have built their inoculation programs around these vaccines, the gap could have a profound impact on the course of the pandemic. A global surge of infections in a world where billions of people remain unvaccinated not only threatens the health of vulnerable individuals but also increases the opportunity for the emergence of yet more variants. The disparity in the ability of countries to weather the pandemic will almost certainly deepen. And the news about limited vaccine efficacy against Omicron infection could depress demand for vaccination throughout the developing world, where many people are already hesitant or preoccupied with other health problems. Most evidence so far is based on laboratory experiments, which do not capture the full range of the body’s immune response, and not from tracking the effect on real-world populations. The results are striking, however. The Pfizer and Moderna shots use the new mRNA technology, which has consistently offered the best protection against infection with every variant. All of the other vaccines are based on older methods of triggering an immune response. The Chinese vaccines Sinopharm and Sinovac — which make up almost half of all shots delivered globally — offer almost zero protection from Omicron infection. The great majority of people in China have received these shots, which are also widely used in low-and middle-income countries such as Mexico and Brazil. A preliminary effectiveness study in Britain found that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine showed no ability to stop Omicron infection six months after vaccination. Ninety percent of vaccinated people in India received this shot, under the brand name Covishield; it has also been widely used across much of sub-Saharan Africa, where Covax, the global Covid vaccine program, has distributed 67 million doses of it to 44 countries. Researchers predict that Russia’s Sputnik vaccine, which is also being used in Africa and Latin America, will show similarly dismal rates of protection against Omicron. Demand for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine had been surging in Africa, because its single-shot delivery regimen makes it easy to deliver in low-resource settings. But it too has shown a negligible ability to block Omicron infection. Indoor mask mandates. Remote classes. Canceled Broadway shows. Across the country, local governments and private institutions threatened by the spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus and the prospect of a holiday season surge have increasingly been putting in place pandemic measures that feel like a blast from the past. The resurgence of policies used months ago and last year serve as a harsh reminder to Americans, young and old, that the anxieties of Covid-19 are far from over. Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York emphasized that point this week when responding to her state’s one-day record for new cases, which topped 21,000 on Friday and then nearly reached 22,000 on Saturday. The surge in cases “is a reminder that the pandemic is not over yet and we must take extra care to keep ourselves and each other safe,” the governor said on Friday. The spike in cases was one reason Governor Hochul ordered that masks be worn inside all public spaces that do not require vaccinations. Universities are responding, too. On Saturday, Harvard, in response to a rise in positive cases, said that it would move to remote learning the first three weeks of January. Middlebury College in Vermont, DePaul University in Chicago and Southern New Hampshire University all announced similar moves this month, and Cornell canceled a ceremony for December graduates and closed libraries. On Friday, after canceling all four of that day’s performances because of breakthrough cases within its ranks, the producers of the famed Christmas show starring the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall announced that they would end the show’s season entirely. Broadway productions had to go dark at times, too, with a series of shows announcing cancellations recently because of Covid outbreaks, despite an industrywide vaccine mandate for audiences and workers. Sports leagues have struggled with their schedules as well. The N.H.L. announced on Saturday that neither the Boston Bruins nor the Nashville Predators would play for at least a week, and that games this weekend involving the Toronto Maple Leafs and Vancouver Canucks would be postponed. Bars and restaurants in Ireland will be required to close early in the week leading up to Christmas, usually their busiest time of the year, as governments around Europe battle a new wave of Covid infections driven by the Omicron variant. Restaurants, bars and public venues must reduce their hours and close at 8 p.m., beginning on Monday. Prime Minister Micheál Martin said that cases of the Omicron variant in Ireland were doubling every few days and that, for Ireland, the worst of the pandemic could be ahead. “I’m apprehensive in terms of what this might mean in terms of the sheer scale of infection,” Mr. Martin told RTE, Ireland’s state broadcaster. “Which is why we can’t take risks — the great unknown being, how severe is this in terms of requiring hospitalizations and I.C.U.s, and just damaging people in terms of health?” On Saturday, health authorities announced 7,333 new cases — double the number of the day before. Health authorities said that 35 percent of positive swab tests taken last Wednesday indicated the Omicron variant, suggesting that it would become the dominant variant in Ireland within days. The new restrictions have been sharply criticized by trade bodies for bar owners and restaurateurs, and also by some lawmakers representing parties in Mr. Martin’s coalition government. The Licensed Vintners Association, representing bar operators in the Dublin area, said that many of its members, already weakened by previous lockdowns, saw the new measures as “closure by camouflage.” The Restaurants Association of Ireland called for the reintroduction of emergency payments to businesses that were forced to close completely in previous lockdowns. The government said it is considering such measures this week. For Mr. Martin and his deputy prime minister, Leo Varadkar, the difficult choice between business needs and public health echoes their painful experience this time last year, when they gave in to calls to ease tight restrictions on socializing and entertainment so that Ireland could enjoy a “meaningful Christmas.” Emergency restrictions were reintroduced on Christmas Eve last year, followed by a January lockdown, which further damaged the retail economy. Jane Suiter, a politics and communications professor at Dublin City University, said that government policy is to contain overall levels of infection while keeping schools open. Ireland’s entertainment businesses, famously convivial at this time of year, seem to be an “easy target.” “It’s hardest on people aged 18 to 30, who’ve already given so much,” she said. “My life isn’t really impacted at all, but my students’ lives are very deeply impacted.” In neighboring Britain, the government is leaving open the possibility of imposing another round of restrictions, the country’s health secretary said on Sunday. Scientific advisers have warned lawmakers that more action is needed, because the country’s surge is threatening to overwhelm its health system, even after the government announced a long-resisted coronavirus contingency plan earlier this month, urging people to work from home if possible and extending a face-mask mandate. Over the weekend, Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, declared a “major incident” — an emergency status that frees up resources — in the capital, and speculation has been swirling over the possibility of a short-term nationwide lockdown.  Britain’s deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, said on Times Radio on Monday that 12 people in the country had died from Omicron. He did not rule out a further tightening of restrictions. As Omicron cases began to surge in several U.S. states, state leaders were calculating their approaches for a fatigued public. Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, whose state is facing a surge that has led him to expand hospital capacity and limit elective surgeries, won’t enforce any lockdowns or mandates. Mr. Hogan, a Republican, said on the program “Fox News Sunday” that the state is “trying to do everything we can” to get the remainder of its state vaccinated — except for more mandates. “We are not anticipating any lockdowns at all,” he said. “We are not considering them.” But the state’s uptick is troubling, Mr. Hogan said: “I would say, in the next couple of days, Omicron is going to be the dominant variant in our state.” “We are anticipating, over the next three to five weeks, probably the worst surge we’ve seen in our hospitals throughout the entire crisis,” he added. Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey is also battling spiking coronavirus cases and overwhelmed hospitals, still from the Delta variant. “Every time you think you got it figured out, it takes a turn you don’t expect,” Mr. Murphy said on the program “Fox News Sunday.” He added, “This is unrelenting. There’s an enormous amount of fatigue out there, as it relates to this virus.” And while a lockdown isn’t likely, it hasn’t been completely ruled out, he said. “You have to leave it on the table, but I don’t see it,” he said, citing the state’s highly vaccinated population, including residents who have gotten a booster shot. “As fatigued as they are, they are largely accepting of what you need to do to push back at this — and for the time being, at least, we think that’s going to work for us.” At least 70 percent of New Jersey residents are fully vaccinated, according to a Times database, putting it in the top states for inoculations. Cases have been doubling in recent weeks, with New Jersey reporting a rolling seven-day average of about 5,500 daily cases. Mr. Murphy did not follow New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, in implementing a recent mask mandate. But he said it would remain an option. Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado on Sunday voiced cautious optimism about his state’s coronavirus numbers, citing a free at-home testing program and vaccinations. Colorado’s numbers have fallen since November. Mr. Polis maintained that he would not impose a mask mandate, something he has said should be up to local officials. “We have a lot less hospitalizations than we did a few weeks ago,” Mr. Polis said on the NBC program “Meet the Press.” He cited pandemic fatigue as a reason to avoid more restrictive measures for now and said that vaccinations would be enough to keep the variant at bay. “People just don’t react well to this ongoing environment of fear for two years,” Mr. Polis said. He added, “Getting three doses of the vaccine is highly effective and all but negates any risk that you face.” CNN is closing its U.S. offices to all employees who are able to work remotely, according to an internal memo sent to staff on Saturday evening. “If your job does not REQUIRE you to be in the office in order to do it, please work from elsewhere,” the network’s president, Jeff Zucker, wrote to staff, citing a surge of Covid cases around the country and within the teams at CNN. “We are doing this out of an abundance of caution,” the memo read. “And it will also protect those who will be in the office by minimizing the number of people who are there.” Masks will be required at all times, “unless you are eating, drinking or in a room by yourself,” Mr. Zucker told staff. CNN’s announcement is part of a wave of large companies hitting the brakes on returning to the office, for many triggering uneasy feelings of déjà vu of the early pandemic. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, announced on Wednesday that the company was delaying the return to physical offices indefinitely. JP Morgan Chase told its workers on Friday they could work remotely until the end of the year. Lyft is not requiring workers to return to offices until at least 2023. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, turns 81 on Christmas Eve, as the world faces the start of the third year of the pandemic. Jonathan Karl, a co-anchor of the ABC Sunday morning show “This Week,” gently probed the confluence of Dr. Fauci’s age with the surging Omicron variant and a job that continues to render him, as Mr. Karl put it, “one of the hardest-working human beings in America.” Did Dr. Fauci intend to stay in his position? “There’s no way I’m going to walk away from this until we get this under control,” Dr. Fauci said, adding: “It’s kind of like we’re halfway through World War II, and you decide, ‘Well, I think I’ve had enough of this. I’m walking away.’ You can’t do that. You’ve got to finish it. And we’re going to finish this and get back to normal.” Dr. Francis Collins, who led the National Institutes of Health for over a decade, also spoke fervently on Fox News Sunday about the need for continued vigilance about Covid-19, including vaccination and masking, saying, “I know people are sick of hearing this stuff. But the virus is not sick of us. It’s thrown us a new curveball, and we’ve got to be ready to hit it.” In October, Dr. Collins announced he would be stepping down from his post at the end of the year to make way for new leadership. He is expected to return to laboratory research. Sunday was his last day as N.I.H. director. In the spirit of making closing observations, he said: “We in this country have somehow gotten all fractured into a hyperpolarized, politicized view that never should have been mixed with public health. It’s been ruinous. And history will judge harshly those people who have continued to defocus the effort and focus on conspiracies and things that are demonstrably false.” However, he added, “We could still turn this around.” “Saturday Night Live” announced, just hours before showtime, that there would be no live audience on Saturday night “out of an abundance of caution” amid the surge of coronavirus cases in New York tied to the Omicron variant. The show also wrote on Twitter that there would be “limited cast and crew,” but it did not say whether any of the cast members had tested positive for the virus. “The show continues to follow all government safety guidelines in addition to a rigorous testing protocol,” it said, adding that those who had tickets to the taping at Rockefeller Center “would be getting more information soon.” A person familiar with plans for the show said that some cast and crew either had tested positive or had been in close contact with people who had. Saturday’s show, the last of 2021, was hosted by the actor Paul Rudd — his fifth time, which was the focus of the subdued opening. Tom Hanks, the Academy Award-winning star of “Forrest Gump,” took the stage and explained that though they had planned a special Christmas show, “Covid came early this year, so in the interest of safety, we do not have an audience and we sent home our cast and most of our crew.” Tina Fey, a former cast member, and Kenan Thompson, a current cast member, then joined him to induct Mr. Rudd into the so-called Five-Timers Club for hosts. They closed the opening by explaining that the impromptu show would consist of new sketches taped earlier in the week and personal favorites from previous episodes.  Mr. Rudd joked, “It’s going to be a little bit like that new Beatles documentary — a lot of old footage but enough new stuff that you’re like, ‘OK, yeah, I’ll watch that.’ ” The show was supposed to have included a musical performance by the English pop artist Charli XCX. She ended up canceling, explaining that she could not perform with so few crew members. “I am devastated and heartbroken,” she said in a statement of her own, adding: “It can’t happen this time but I’ll be back! I am currently safe and healthy but of course very sad.” “Please look after yourselves out there and make sure you get vaccinated if you haven’t already,” she continued. NBC declined to comment beyond the show’s statement. “S.N.L.” normally tapes a dress rehearsal at 8 p.m. Eastern time on Saturday, and then the live performance airs at 11:30 p.m. Mr. Rudd closed the show by thanking the cast and crew for working so hard under stressful circumstances. “I know it wasn’t the Christmas show you expected, but that’s the beauty of this place. Like life, it’s unpredictable,” he said, as he and four others onstage wore face masks.  He finished by cracking a joke at Mr. Hanks’s expense. “As my good friend Tom Hanks once said in a movie, life’s like a big, weird chocolate bar: sometimes it’s delicious; other sometimes it’s got that orange cream filling in it,” he said. “And it’s like, OK, it’s not what I would have chosen, but it’s better than nothing.”  State Senator Doug Ericksen, a Republican who had led efforts to oppose Washington State’s Covid-19 emergency orders and vaccine mandates, has died after his own battle with the illness. He was 52. Last month, Mr. Ericksen wrote to his Republican colleagues in the Legislature, telling them he had tested positive for the coronavirus after traveling to El Salvador. He asked colleagues for help in getting monoclonal antibodies. It’s unclear where Mr. Ericksen was when he died. Mr. Ericksen’s family said in a statement on Saturday that he passed away the day before. “Please keep our family in your prayers and thank you for continuing to respect our privacy in this extremely difficult time,” the family wrote in a statement shared by the State Senate’s Republican caucus. Mr. Ericksen, who represented much of Whatcom County, had served in the Legislature since 1999, becoming a prominent conservative voice and an early backer of Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign. Over the pandemic, he led efforts to combat Gov. Jay Inslee’s coronavirus restrictions, introducing legislation that would have prohibited vaccine mandates and calling for the governor to resign. “Washington State is No. 1 in government coercion,” Mr. Ericksen said in a statement last month. It’s unclear whether Mr. Ericksen had been vaccinated. State Senator Reuven Carlyle, a Democrat, wrote in a message on Saturday that he and Mr. Ericksen had attended the same high school and then had served together for years as leaders on the State Senate committee focused on environmental, energy and technology issues. “Our policy battles were tough and difficult, but we respected one another’s fierce devotion to serving the public and our communities,” Mr. Carlyle wrote. “Our friendship found ways to rise above political differences.” As the Omicron variant continues to spread around the country, many more people, including those who have been vaccinated, will test positive for the coronavirus. So what should you do if you’re one of them? We spoke to physicians and infectious disease experts about the steps you should take after a positive test or if you find out you’ve been in close contact with an infected person. Here’s their advice. If you’re in public or around people when you get the bad news, put on a mask immediately. Then isolate yourself as quickly as possible, even if you don’t have symptoms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends isolating for 10 days after you test positive. If you live with roommates or family, try to separate yourself from other people (and animals) as much as possible. “You should take yourself out of society,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco. “Wall yourself up in a cocoon.” No. In most cases, you won’t know which variant of coronavirus you’ve caught and your lab test typically won’t tell you. In general, the guidance on isolation, monitoring and treatment does not change based on which variant infected you. First identified in Botswana and South Africa in November, the Omicron variant has surged around the world over the past few weeks, faster than any previously known form of the coronavirus. While there’s a lot that scientists have yet to understand about Omicron, what they know already makes it clear that the variant could cause a huge number of new cases and that it could push some hospital systems to the breaking point. Scientists first recognized Omicron thanks to its distinctive combination of more than 50 mutations. Some of them were carried by earlier variants such as Alpha and Beta, and previous experiments had demonstrated that they could enable a coronavirus to spread quickly. Other mutations were known to help coronaviruses evade antibodies produced by vaccines. The first clues that Omicron could evade immunity came from South Africa, where scientists estimate that at least 70 percent of people have had Covid-19 at some point in the pandemic. An unexpectedly large fraction of Omicron cases involved people who had previously been infected. When Omicron surged in England, British researchers similarly found that many people infected with the new variant had already survived Covid. The researchers estimated that the risk of reinfection with Omicron was about five times that of other variants. For a deeper understanding of this increased risk of reinfection, a number of teams of scientists have studied the antibodies produced by people who recover from Covid-19. If they mix those antibodies in a dish with other variants, the antibodies do a good job of preventing the viruses from infecting human cells. But if they mix those antibodies with Omicron, it still manages to get inside the cells much of the time. That means that the mutations Omicron carries are changing the shape of its surface proteins, where antibodies lock onto the coronavirus. This ability to evade immune defenses is probably part of the explanation as to why Omicron cases are doubling so quickly — in some places, that can happen in as little as two days, or less. While other variants are getting knocked out by antibodies, Omicron is succeeding in infecting more cells — making it more successful at getting into more people. In the United States, over 204 million people are fully vaccinated, but that’s still only 62 percent of the population, much lower than in most other wealthy countries. At the county level, vaccination rates range from about 83 percent in places like Montgomery County, Md., a populous area just outside Washington, D.C., to around 15 percent in rural places like McPherson County in northern South Dakota. As the Omicron variant surges, and experts say that vaccinations strongly protect against severe illness, U.S. public health officials are closely examining ways to reach the least-vaccinated areas. But the roadblocks are not the same everywhere. Some clearly have to do with politics: Republican-leaning areas have generally been vaccine laggards. But pockets of the country can have their own quirks unrelated to partisanship. Here is a look at the challenges faced by three counties where, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, vaccination rates are among the lowest in the nation. (State figures for those counties may vary from the C.D.C. data because of differences in methodology, reporting lags and other factors.) Resistance to vaccines is not new in LaGrange County, a rural area along Indiana’s border with Michigan. Just 22 percent of residents are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, and, according to Dr. Tony Pechin, the county health officer, only 15 percent of children in the county are up-to-date on standard vaccines by the age of 2. Dr. Pechin said that he had encountered the usual conspiracy theories about vaccines, and that even some longtime patients would not heed his advice to get the shots. But the most important factor, he said, is that about half the county’s 40,000 residents are Amish, a group that overwhelmingly rejects the vaccines. Among non-Amish residents, he said, the vaccination rate is 45 to 48 percent. Dr. Pechin said that a pharmacy frequented by Amish residents was among the first in LaGrange County to receive doses but had vaccinated just eight people in six months. The state health commissioner sent a delegation to meet with Amish leaders in the spring, and the C.D.C. sent another over the summer. “When they were done,” Dr. Pechin said of the envoys, “they called me and just said, ‘Good luck, Tony.’” When Hurricane Laura made landfall near Cameron Parish in August 2020, many residents left damaged homes behind and took refuge inland — and have yet to return. According to the C.D.C., the vaccination rate is just 17 percent. But Louisiana health officials say that those figures do not take account of the population shift. “Although the numbers look awful, they’re not as bad as they appear, because of an outflux of people due to the natural disasters,” said Dr. Lacey Cavanaugh, a regional health officer for the Louisiana Department of Health. But if the statistics were calculated to reflect the current populations of Cameron Parish and others ravaged by recent storms, she said, they would probably still show vaccination rates below national averages. Laura destroyed much of the parish’s limited health infrastructure, so for months, health officials administered vaccines in a tent in a hospital parking lot. And for residents consumed by the work of repairing homes and businesses, getting vaccinated fell low on the priority list. State health officials have worked to bring vaccines directly to disaster recovery events, and advised residents that getting sick with Covid-19 could make the road back even harder.  “Once you’re protected” from the virus, Dr. Cavanaugh said, “that’s one less thing for you to worry about.” A rural county with a history of going its own way — it refused to join Alabama in seceding from the Union during the Civil War —  faces many of the challenges that have hampered the state’s vaccine uptake. Vaccine misinformation is still spreading on social media, said Dr. Karen Landers, a regional officer with the state’s Public Health Department, despite months of efforts with local leaders, faith-based organizations and pharmacies. The county’s vaccination rate has stalled at around 21 percent, according to the C.D.C. Persuading young people that they are vulnerable to the disease and need a vaccine can be a particularly acute problem, she said. But Dr. Landerssaid she remained determined: “We know that not everyone will listen to us, but that does not alleviate our responsibility.”"

So what should you do if you’re one of them? We spoke to physicians and infectious disease experts about the steps you should take after a positive test or if you find out you’ve been in close contact with an infected person. Here’s their advice. If you’re in public or around people when you get the bad news, put on a mask immediately. Then isolate yourself as quickly as possible, even if you don’t have symptoms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends isolating for at least five full days, followed by five days of wearing a mask around others, as long as you don’t have a fever and any other symptoms are improving. If you are seriously ill with Covid or have a weakened immune system, the C.D.C. recommends an isolation period of 10 to 20 days. If you have a fever, the agency advises you to stay home until the fever resolves. Read more about the new C.D.C. guidelines. If you are waiting for test results but have symptoms of Covid-19, the C.D.C. now recommends that you isolate anyway, regardless of vaccination status. If you live with roommates or family, try to separate yourself from other people (and animals) as much as possible. “You should take yourself out of society,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco. “Wall yourself up in a cocoon.” Isolating in a home with other people may be difficult, but do the best you can. That means staying in your room, away from other members of the household, even for meals. Someone should deliver food to your bedroom door if possible. If the home has more than one bathroom, designate one just for the infected person. If the infected person is a child or older person who needs assistance, both the caregiver and the infected person should wear a mask when the caregiver enters the room, and open the windows if possible. If others are in the house, always wear a high-quality mask when you leave your room. Everyone should mask up in shared spaces. After using a shared bathroom, disinfect the toilet seat and handle, as well as the faucet handles, soap dispenser, counter and light switch. Close the lid before you flush, and turn on the exhaust fan. Open windows to improve ventilation in shared areas. The people living in your household should take precautions, but they don’t need to panic about getting infected too, especially if they’re vaccinated and boosted. “The household rate of contracting Covid from someone is not 100 percent by a long shot, even with the more transmissible variants,” said Dr. Paul Sax, an infectious disease expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School. While it can help incrementally to continue to wipe down shared spaces, “the most important thing is keeping people from breathing air that is filled with germs,” said Tara Kirk Sell, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. If you have a HEPA air cleaner, place it in or outside your bedroom. If you’ve tested positive and feel well, you can take a walk outdoors and get fresh air. If you’re in a city where you will cross paths with other people, wear a mask and keep your distance. If you tested positive after taking a rapid home test, you may want to take a second home test using a different brand or go to a testing center to confirm the result. False positives aren’t common with home tests, but they can happen. Even so, you should assume the positive result is correct, wear a mask and avoid close contact with other people until you get retested. If your positive test came from a laboratory, a second test isn’t necessary. If you receive a negative test on your rapid home test, don’t use that as your sole basis for decision making. The C.D.C. advises that a negative result on a rapid home test does not rule out a Covid infection. To improve the results from an antigen test, the agency recommends testing twice over a three-day period with at least 24 hours and no more than 48 hours between tests. No. In most cases, you won’t know which variant of coronavirus you’ve caught and your lab test typically won’t tell you. In general, the guidance on isolation, monitoring and treatment does not change based on which variant infected you. Think about where you’ve been and who might have inhaled your germs. Contact your employer and let them know. Most workplaces have protocols in place for contact tracing when an employee tests positive. You also want to alert anyone with whom you’ve spent time, going back at least two days before you got tested or started having symptoms, said Dr. Sax. The C.D.C. defines a close contact as someone who was less than six feet from you for 15 minutes or more. It may feel overwhelming, or even shameful, to tell people about your positive test, said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. “A lot of people think it’s some failure if you get infected,” Dr. Jha said. “This is an incredibly contagious variant. A lot of people are going to get it. That is not a moral failure.” Don’t forget to tell your doctor too, particularly if you have an underlying medical condition, like high blood pressure or diabetes, that puts you at higher risk. If the infected person is a child, call your pediatrician. You also need to call your child’s school, as well as anyone they’ve had close contact with at play dates, parties or other activities. Monitor your symptoms. You can use a pulse oximeter to keep track of your blood oxygen levels. Most healthy people will get an oxygen reading around 95 to 99 percent. You should seek medical advice if the reading drops quickly or the level dips to 93 percent or lower. The devices can be less accurate for people with darker skin, so pay attention to the trend. If your reading drops by four points, it’s worth checking in with a doctor. You should also see a doctor if you take a turn for the worse, have trouble breathing or have any symptom that causes you concern. You can learn more in our story, Why Days 5 to 10 Are So Important When You Have Coronavirus. Ask your doctor if you are eligible for monoclonal antibodies, a treatment that can help your body fight Covid-19 and lower your risk for severe illness, particularly for people in a high-risk group. For monoclonal antibody therapy to be most effective, it needs to be given soon after diagnosis, even if you’re not feeling bad yet. If you don’t have a regular doctor, you can also contact the infectious disease clinic at your hospital and ask about the treatment, said Dr. Celine Gounder, an epidemiologist at N.Y.U. medical school. Only one monoclonal antibody treatment, sotrovimab made by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology, has performed well against Omicron in laboratory experiments. Although the supply of sotrovimab is very limited, the Biden administration is in talks with GlaxoSmithKline about securing more doses to be delivered by early next year. The Food and Drug Administration has authorized two different oral treatments for people who are vulnerable to becoming severely ill because they are older or have medical conditions such as obesity or diabetes. Paxlovid, developed by Pfizer, is authorized for high-risk patients age 12 and older, and is meant to be taken as 30 pills over five days. Another pill treatment from Merck, known as molnupiravir, has been authorized for people 18 and older, and is meant to be taken as 40 pills over five days. To calculate your five-day isolation period, count your first day of symptoms as Day 0. If you never had symptoms but have a confirmed positive test, count Day 0 as the day you tested. You can leave isolation after five days if you don’t have a fever and any symptoms you had are getting better. If your symptoms persist or get worse, if you are immunocompromised or are severely ill with Covid, consult with your health care provider about when to leave isolation, which may last between 10 and 20 days. After isolation, the C.D.C. advises that you keep wearing a mask around others for an additional five days. Don’t remove your mask to eat or drink around other people, don’t travel and don’t spend time around high risk people until the masking period has ended. Although the agency didn’t recommend testing after isolation, the new guidelines say people should take a rapid antigen test after the five day isolation period if they have “access to a test and want to test.” Vaccinated adults who had booster shots and fully vaccinated children don’t need to quarantine after a potential exposure, but they should get tested five days later and wear masks around other people for 10 days.  People who are unvaccinated should quarantine for five days after exposure and then get tested. Wear masks around other people for 10 days. This also applies to people who are eligible for booster shots but have not received them yet. The C.D.C. has said that unvaccinated students who are exposed to the virus do not need to miss school after a potential exposure as long as two tests taken during the next week are negative. Read more about the “test to stay” protocol. Yes. The degree of protection you get from a previous infection varies widely. You’re more protected if you’ve also been vaccinated. Early studies suggest antibodies from a past Covid infection alone are not a strong defense against Omicron. “Unfortunately, reinfection after people have had Covid before, can occur, and the protection of previous infections is very variable and unpredictable,” said Dr. David Rubin, the director of PolicyLab at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. “So some people seem to be very protected and don’t get Covid again, and other people can get it again and even get quite severe disease again.”"
