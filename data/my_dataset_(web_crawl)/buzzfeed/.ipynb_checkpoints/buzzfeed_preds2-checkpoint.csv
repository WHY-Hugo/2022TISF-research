All three nightmares share a common cause: These people had been placed under the care — and control — of legal guardians. America’s guardianship system was designed as a last resort to be used only in the rare and drastic event that someone is totally incapacitated by mental or physical disability. In those cases, conscientious guardians can provide vital support, often in complex and distressing circumstances. But an investigation by BuzzFeed News has found that the system has grown into a vast, lucrative, and poorly regulated industry that has subsumed more than a million people, many of whom insist they are capable of making their own decisions, and placed them at risk of abuse, theft, and even death.
The #FreeBritney movement has drawn international attention to the case of Britney Spears, and wrongdoing by individual guardians has surfaced in the past, but our investigation reveals the systemic failings behind these isolated stories.

1,"""I knew I would be addressing you, my beloved community, and you would need words of comfort and hope from your rabbi. But I do not have those words for you. Not yet.""","


Rabbi Angela Buchdahl was surprised to see she had a voicemail waiting for her Saturday morning but, when she heard the message, she discovered she had been unwillingly thrust into the middle of the violent standoff inside a Texas synagogue where four people were being held hostage.""We have an actual gunman who is claiming to have bombs and he wants to talk to you,"" Buchdahl said during a sermon Friday at Central Synagogue. The message, she said, came from Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker, hundreds of miles away at Beth Israel in Colleyville. ""If you can call me back at this number that would be greatly appreciated. This is not a joke."" Advertisement     In her shabbat sermon, Buchdahl gave her first account of speaking to a man who would hold four people hostage in the Colleyville synagogue for more than 11 hours. FBI Director Christopher Wray has called the attack an ""act of terrorism targeting the Jewish community."" The gunman, 44-year-old Malik Faisal Akram of Britain, is believed to have demanded the release of a terrorist convicted of plotting to kill American soldiers and blow up the Statue of Liberty.None of the hostages were harmed, but the incident has shaken the Jewish community and, as Buchdahl offered in her sermon, has been an unsettling reminder about anti-Semitism across the US.
 


""I knew I would be addressing you, my beloved community, and you would need words of comfort and hope from your rabbi,"" she said. ""But I do not have those words for you. Not yet.""Saturday's incident served as a grim reminder about the rise in extremism, she said.""I cannot assure you that this will not happen again,"" she said. ""I do not have a neat pronouncement for how we will fight back the alarming, ugly growth of anti-Semitism.""Yet returning to synagogues, and celebrating shabbat once more, was a sign that a sense of hope wouldn't be elusive forever.""This is what resilience looks like,"" she said. ""We go back to our sanctuaries. We claim shabbat. We support each other in community.""Buchdahl confirmed she spoke twice to the gunman, leaving her shaken.""I saw first hand that you can't negotiate with a terrorist,"" she said. ""And more and more people in our country and around the globe are captivated by terrifying, hateful ideologies, which they value more than their own lives.""Akram ultimately died in a ""shooting incident"" after the hourslong standoff with officers, but it wasn't immediately clear who fired the fatal shot.Akram had been welcomed into the Colleyville synagogue, where Rabbi Cytron-Walker offered him tea during the cold day. Buchdahl offered few details about what the gunman requested, or why he had asked to speak to her during the standoff.""When the gunman called me a second time, he told me, 'I am running out of patience, and you are running out of time,'"" she said. ""I had already talked to the authorities. I knew there was nothing else I could do but wait and pray. And I really prayed — a trembling, pleading prayer.""Buchdahl said she feels as though her prayers were answered. The hostages were able to escape unharmed, even if members of the Jewish community continue to be held by the fear of anti-Semitism, or the possibility of another attack. Advertisement     ""I also know if we only build fortresses around our sanctuaries and around our hearts, then hate wins,"" she said. ""We've emerged. But now we are angry and fearful, and I cannot tell you not to feel those things. I am feeling them myself and I don't quite know what to do next.""""I'm not yet ready to muster a message of optimism today,"" she added. ""But I cannot escape it, eventually because we as a Jewish people are unshakably, doggedly, eternally captives of hope.""

2,"When it comes to treatment with monoclonal antibodies, a CDC report finds that some people with COVID are less likely to get them than others.","


During the past two years of the pandemic, there have been some profound racial and ethnic disparities, with some communities of color having COVID hospitalization and mortality rates more than double that of other groups of people.Now, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report suggests there are inequities in the use of lifesaving COVID treatments, with some people less likely than others to get early treatment with monoclonal antibodies, which has been shown to prevent hospitalizations and deaths. Advertisement     The analysis found that people who are Hispanic faced the most barriers in accessing the treatment; they received monoclonal antibodies 58% less often than their non-Hispanic peers.Patients who were Asian, as well as those who identified with the “other” category, including Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and multiracial patients, received monoclonal antibodies about 48% and 47% less often, respectively, than white patients. Black patients were treated with the protective proteins 22% less often.The research team, led by Jennifer Wiltz and Amy Feehan, looked at electronic records for COVID treatments in 805,276 patients 20 and older admitted across 41 US healthcare systems between November 2020 and August 2021. About 11% were treated in a hospital, where the differences in use among racial and ethnic groups were less pronounced.The treatments included monoclonal antibodies, the antiviral medication remdesivir, and the steroid dexamethasone, which is used to fight inflammation. Some are used early on in an infection and can help prevent COVID hospitalization, like monoclonal antibodies. Others, like steroids, are used later in serious cases to battle out-of-control immune reactions. Advertisement     The average monthly use of monoclonal antibodies was 4% or less for all racial and ethnic groups, according to the report released Jan. 14. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins infused or injected into patients, typically in health clinics or doctor’s offices within 10 days of symptoms.Overall, average monthly use of monoclonal antibodies was low: 4% in white patients, 2.8% in Black patients, 2.2% in patients who were Asian or another race, and 1.8% in Hispanic patients.Once hospitalized, there seemed to be relatively small differences in the use of dexamethasone, and patients who were Black received remdesivir about 9% more often than others.The researchers said the disparities they uncovered with monoclonal antibodies may not reflect those in the real world because they were restricted to patients who received COVID treatments through a healthcare system; monoclonal antibodies can be given to patients in government-run infusion sites that likely go unrecorded.The researchers also didn’t analyze the reason for the disparities, but they speculate that a number of systemic factors are likely to blame, such as limited access to COVID testing, insufficient health insurance, potential bias among medical professionals or a lack of a primary care doctor to recommend the treatments, and language barriers, which can leave people unaware of therapies and vulnerable to severe yet preventable COVID outcomes.These factors also make it more likely people of color will develop medical conditions that raise their chances of severe COVID, the CDC says, contributing to disproportionate coronavirus infection, hospitalization, and death rates among racial and ethnic groups.“I just want to emphasize how little I was surprised by these data,” Dr. Utibe Essien, an assistant professor of medicine and health disparities researcher at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, told BuzzFeed News. “This is not a new issue. There are so many tiers and levers that we can all be pulling to address this, going all the way from when these drugs are developed to who is present in the studies that test these drugs to how easy is it for patients to access medications at a doctor or pharmacy.”There are some things that could help “potentially reverse” these disparities, Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, told BuzzFeed News.Mobile clinics that bring monoclonal antibody treatments to patients and telemedicine visits that make it easier to see a doctor can help spread awareness and access to treatments for high-risk patients.One recent study found telemedicine visits helped increase attendance at follow-up doctor’s appointments after hospitalization from 52% to 70% among Black patients. The study included patients discharged from five Pennsylvania hospitals for any reason from January 2019 to June 2020. In contrast, follow-up care among white patients dropped slightly, from 68% to 67% in the same period. Advertisement     COVID treatment guidelines don’t always take into account race and ethnicityAlthough the CDC study looked at patients treated before the Omicron and Delta surges, some states like North Carolina, Texas, and Mississippi are still struggling with COVID treatment shortages, leading doctors to prioritize therapies for the highest-risk patients.National health officials often recommend COVID treatment guidelines, but states may make their own recommendations, meaning guidance and access to COVID therapies may differ depending on where you live.The FDA, for example, includes race and ethnicity as a potential risk factor for severe COVID in its medication fact sheets for healthcare providers. An FDA spokesperson told BuzzFeed News it’s up to doctors to “consider the benefit-risk for an individual patient” when determining access to therapies.Some states like New York and Utah have adopted that language, stating doctors should consider race and ethnicity when assessing a patient's risk for severe COVID.
 


Some conservative organizations and politicians, however, say the language is discriminatory.The CDC acknowledges that some racial and ethnic groups are more likely to get sick and die from COVID, but the agency relies on the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel — a National Institutes of Health group of US medical professionals — for recommendations on treatment use.In December, the panel recommended clinicians prioritize COVID treatments for certain patients under a tiered approach that does not consider race or ethnicity in scenarios where supplies are limited.At the top of the list are those who cannot produce adequate protection against the coronavirus either by vaccination or infection, which includes people who are immunocompromised. Just as much precedence should be given to unvaccinated people at high risk for severe disease, particularly those 75 or older, or those age 65 and older who have other risk factors. Advertisement     In the event your doctor isn’t aware of potential treatment options for you, the FDA suggests directing them to its website with information on authorized COVID therapies.If your doctor thinks you’ll benefit from treatment, you may need to schedule an appointment at a clinic or infusion site. The National Infusion Center Association shows where all available COVID antibody therapy sites are located in your area. Just enter your city, state, or zip code to get started.“I always recommend that people continue to maintain safe practices (masking, social distancing, and staying home when sick if possible) and if ever feeling seriously ill, going to the doctor, urgent care, or ER,” Essien said.

3,There’s a very American reason for why Prince Harry wants police protection in the UK: guns.,"


This is an excerpt from The Royal Tea, BuzzFeed News' newsletter about the royal family. You can sign up here.
 


The Queen could find herself celebrating her 70th year on the British throne without all of her family by her side, as Prince Harry has claimed that it’s too dangerous for the Sussexes to visit the UK under the current security arrangements.What does Harry want to protect his wife and children that his hired bodyguards can’t currently provide in the UK?There’s one obvious, all-American answer: guns.Unbeknownst to the public, for months the Duke of Sussex has been petitioning the UK government to allow him to pay for police protection for himself and his family while they are in the country. Harry was stripped of police security when he and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, stepped back from life as working members of the royal family in 2020 — now he’s willing to pursue legal action in order to get it back. Advertisement     On Jan. 16, the Mail on Sunday reported that Harry’s lawyers filed a request for a judicial review of the UK Home Office’s decision to bar the Sussexes from police protection. Depending on the results of the review, the matter could go before a High Court judge.In response to what the Sussexes’ spokesperson called “a leak in a UK tabloid, with surreptitious timing,” they quickly released a statement to set “the facts right.”“Prince Harry inherited a security risk at birth, for life,” the spokesperson said. “He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats. While his role within the institution has changed, his profile as a member of the royal family has not. Nor has the threat to him and his family.
 


“The Duke and Duchess of Sussex personally fund a private security team for their family, yet that security cannot replicate the necessary police protection needed whilst in the UK. In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable to return to his home.”The spokesperson said the duke’s security was compromised due to the absence of police protection while leaving a charity event during a visit to the UK in July — although no additional information was given, even after a further request by BuzzFeed News, about exactly what happened during this supposed 2021 security breach. After a subsequent failed attempt at negotiations with the Home Office, the Sussexes’ lawyers filed the formal request for judicial review in September. Advertisement     “As is widely known, others who have left public office and have an inherent threat risk receive police protection at no cost to them. The goal for Prince Harry has been simple – to ensure the safety of himself and his family while in the UK so his children can know his home country,” said the spokesperson.Of course, like any Harry and Meghan news, this sparked a media firestorm. Sussex critics accused Harry of overinflating the threat and seeking royal perks after rejecting official royal work. Sussex supporters pointed to Princess Diana’s lack of official police protection following her divorce and the role that may have played in her death.Harry’s claim that he, Meghan, and their two small children can’t be safe in the UK without police officers guarding their backs may seem a bit odd when you consider the fact that the country’s rich and famous live in safety with their private security teams.But private security guards in the UK cannot carry guns.
 


Until last year, Harry had always been protected in the UK by an elite — and armed — branch of the Metropolitan Police Service known as SO14, or the Royalty Protection Group. These taxpayer-funded guards provide 24/7 protection to the high-profile members of the royal family (the Queen, Prince Charles, the Cambridge family) and accompany other members of the royal family further down in the line of succession to official events and visits.Only a select group of high-profile individuals, such as current and former prime ministers and foreign heads of state, are allowed to have police protection (and therefore armed protection) in the UK — and the Home Office must give its consent. Advertisement     “Firearms are not an acceptable means of protection in Great Britain,” the December 2021 Home Office guide on firearm licensing states. “It has been the view of successive governments for many years that the private possession and carriage of firearms for personal protection is likely to lead to an increase in levels of violence.”That’s not to say that police won't protect the Sussexes in a time of crisis. UK police are required by law to inform individuals if they’re aware of a threat to their life; it stands to reason that any potential threats would be reported to the Sussexes’ security team and officers would intervene if necessary.As it stands, Harry has given every indication that he will not bring his wife and children to the UK unless he has police protection. Allowing him to pay for police security would be a groundbreaking precedent that could open the doors for other high-profile private individuals to make their own legal challenges.A Sussex spokesperson declined to comment on the ongoing legal matter and referred BuzzFeed News to their previous statement. Buckingham Palace referred BuzzFeed News to the Home Office, which declined to comment on security matters.The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations this summer will mark one of the biggest events in the history of the British monarchy and a golden opportunity for the Mountbatten-Windsor family to present a united front after a turbulent year.Yet in a strange twist of fate, the decision that may determine whether or not the family will stand together on the Buckingham Palace balcony during the Jubilee celebrations could be made not by the Queen, but by the UK government.

4,Scavino filed the lawsuit under his name after a judge rejected his bid to only be known as “Plaintiff.”,"


WASHINGTON — Daniel Scavino Jr., who served as former president Donald Trump’s deputy chief of staff, was revealed late Friday to be the person who had tried, and failed, to win a judge’s permission to fight a subpoena for his phone records in the Jan. 6 investigation using a pseudonym.The legal mystery began on Jan. 5 this year, when a person only identified as “Plaintiff” filed a lawsuit contesting a subpoena issued to Verizon Communications by the special congressional committee probing the Capitol insurrection. Normally, litigants can only proceed anonymously with a judge’s permission, and the anonymous plaintiff’s lawyer filed that request a few weeks later. On Jan. 19, US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell said no, and Scavino refiled the complaint under his name in the same case on Friday. Advertisement     Scavino has been one of Trump’s closest allies for years, dating back to his time as his golf caddy. He was one of the few aides to stay with Trump from the 2016 campaign through the entirety of the presidency. He was a constant presence at Trump's side during public events, and behind the scenes on the president's Twitter account as the official director of social media.Scavino and his attorney had argued that his identity was “wholly irrelevant” for a judge to decide whether the committee’s subpoena was lawful. They argued that revealing his identity could subject him to “retaliation” by the committee and public criticism.Howell was unconvinced that these were good enough reasons to carve out an exception to the general principle that court proceedings — including the identities of litigants — should be accessible to the public. She pointed out that even though the subpoena had been issued to Verizon, and not Scavino, “the substance of this lawsuit is plainly to challenge the investigative scope and purposes of the Select Committee.” When someone sues the government, the judge wrote, it was “well-settled” that there was an even greater public interest.Scavino joins a handful of other individuals in Trump’s orbit, along with the former president himself, who have gone to court to try to contest the committee’s efforts to gather information about their communications before, during, and after the attack on the Capitol. Earlier this week, the US Supreme Court refused Trump’s last-ditch effort to intervene and stop the National Archives from turning over a collection of nearly 800 pages of documents that the former president had argued should be shielded by executive privilege; President Joe Biden had declined to support that position, and Trump lost challenges to that in the lower courts. Advertisement     On Thursday, a federal judge denied a request by Trump spokesperson Taylor Budowich to issue an injunction that would force the committee to destroy bank records it had already received in response to a subpoena.Other challengers include conservative attorney John Eastman, “Stop the Steal” movement organizer Ali Alexander, and longtime Trump ally Sebastian Gorka. Steve Bannon, another top adviser to Trump, is facing criminal prosecution for defying a committee subpoena; he’s vowed to fight the charges.Scavino’s lawyer, Stanley Woodward Jr., declined to comment.

5,Progressives are hopeful that Jessica Cisneros can beat Rep. Henry Cuellar in a rematch after the flurry of activity this week.,"


Progressives are cheering at the timing of FBI activity around the home and campaign office of US Rep. Henry Cuellar, a conservative Democrat they’ve been hoping to knock out of office for years. Details about what is actually at the heart of the FBI activity are unclear, but, whatever it is, they see it as a boon for their own candidate, Jessica Cisneros, who is running against him in Texas’s 28th Congressional District.Cisneros, an immigration attorney who ran against Cuellar in 2020 and who lost to him by less than four points in the high-profile primary, is backed by Justice Democrats, the same group that propelled progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez into office. The Cisneros and Cuellar rematch is the first challenger race the group is involved with this cycle, and early voting starts in February. Advertisement     “The fact that it is shrouded in mystery and Henry has not immediately come to the front line to defend himself screams major alarms for him, his candidacy, his race, his meaning,” Jen Ramos, a Cisneros endorser and member of the Texas State Democratic Executive Committee, told BuzzFeed News. “As long as [Cisneros] maintains focus and as long as she continues to advocate for the district, which she has a history of doing, then I think she could see victory come March 1.”News of the FBI activity broke on Wednesday evening when local outlets reported it. On Thursday, ABC News first reported that the raid was related to a federal investigation of Azerbaijan and multiple US businesspeople, noting that it was not clear if Cuellar was the subject of the federal grand jury probe. Cuellar’s official office has remained vague on any details and did not answer the question when BuzzFeed News asked what the activity was pertaining to. A spokesperson passed along the single public statement on the matter they’ve made since: “Congressman Cuellar will fully cooperate in any investigation. He is committed to ensuring that justice and the law are upheld.” Cuellar did not respond to a text sent directly to his cellphone by BuzzFeed News asking how he thought it would affect his run against Cisneros.A longtime political adviser to Cuellar, Colin Strother, also did not immediately respond to a text and an email from BuzzFeed News about the FBI activity and whether the lawmaker was worried it would affect the primary. BuzzFeed News, in the same text and email that went without immediate response, asked why and when Strother had locked down his own Twitter account, which progressives had taken note of.Nancy Pelosi’s office did not respond to a request for comment on whether the speaker or her office are aware of what the FBI activity was regarding, or whether she had spoken with Cuellar.“Rep. Cuellar is entitled to a presumption of innocence of any wrongdoing,” tweeted Julián Castro, a progressive former presidential candidate and Texan. He endorsed Cisneros in her last run. “But the working families of TX-28 who need a champion in Congress can’t risk losing a Democratic seat because the incumbent is under a cloud of suspicion.” Advertisement     It’s clear on Cisneros’s end that her campaign saw it as an opening. ""We are aware of the news regarding Congressman Cuellar and the active FBI investigation. We are closely watching as this develops. In the meantime, we are focused on our campaign to deliver change to South Texas families and will not be making any additional comments at this time,"" Cisneros said in a statement that she tweeted. It was preceded by a cheeky tweet noting that she had ""[b]een getting a lot of new followers tonight!"" The Washington Post reported that her campaign also sent out a fundraising email related to the situation. (Cisneros did not respond to texts sent to her phone asking if she would do a phone interview on the rematch.)Even before this week’s events, progressives were seeing this as a more competitive race than the last cycle and were planning to build on the momentum Cisneros built then.“Jessica would have probably won her race if she’d just had like one more month to build her name recognition. That’s the biggest challenge for first-time candidates is that so many people don’t know their name,” Waleed Shahid, a spokesperson for Justice Democrats, told BuzzFeed News, speaking of the 2020 cycle. “This time around Jessica has way more name recognition.”Shahid added, “It took Cori Bush two times to win, it took Marie Newman two times to win, and I think Jessica can do that this time as well.”The Laredo-area district, a largely rural border area that struggles with rampant poverty, extends up to San Antonio. After redistricting, it has moved to the left, but in 2020, Democrats were bewildered when the reliable stronghold of south Texas shifted toward Donald Trump in the presidential race, a troubling sign about the party’s ability to continue to appeal to Latino voters.Cuellar, a nine-term Democrat, is often on the conservative end of the Democratic spectrum in Congress. He has built a reputation of being pro–border security and an ally to law enforcement, often chastising the Democratic party for being too progressive. He was the only Democrat to vote against a bill aimed at protecting access to abortion last year passed by the House, in the context of abortion rights being under threat in the country and, specifically, Texas. On Friday, Cisneros and allies were attacking Cuellar for making an apparent appearance via Zoom at an anti-abortion event; his office did not immediately respond to an inquiry from BuzzFeed News to verify that he had done so.

6,"“It should not take a call to a congressperson for a child with blood clots in the brain or [a] tangled spinal cord to be considered urgent humanitarian circumstances,” one attorney said.","


A child with a blood clot in her brain. A 7-year-old with a skin condition that threatened her organs. A couple who faced anti-gay threats back home. Every time, US border officials ignored or denied their requests for humanitarian parole without explanation, forcing the immigrants to wait in squalid, dangerous conditions in Mexico.For months, attorneys in Nogales, Arizona, located along the US–Mexico border, have been waiting to hear back on the fate of their asylum-seeking clients who are particularly vulnerable to violence or need medical care they can’t get in Mexico. Advertisement     Up until mid-December, the vast majority of the requests for humanitarian relief had yet to get a response. Officially known as humanitarian parole, it allows immigrants who are otherwise ineligible to enter the US to come into the country based on urgent humanitarian or significant public benefit reasons. It's also one of the few ways asylum-seekers can currently seek protection from within the US instead of abroad. That’s why advocates say timely decisions and specific information about why someone is denied are crucial.Each day that passes means the asylum-seekers continue to wait in border cities where they’re often targeted for extortion, kidnapping, or assault, said Chelsea Sachau, an attorney with the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, which provides free legal aid to detained immigrants facing deportation in Arizona and asylum-seekers in Nogales, Mexico.It was only when she told Customs and Border Protection that she was going to ask members of Congress to intervene that the agency granted exemptions to four families, which allowed them to enter the US without humanitarian parole.“It should not take a call to a congressperson for a child with blood clots in the brain or [a] tangled spinal cord to be considered urgent humanitarian circumstances and therefore allowed into the US,” Sachau said. Advertisement     Part of the issue is that the statute that includes humanitarian parole is written in a way that gives a lot of discretion to CBP officials who often don’t include a reason as to why they’re denying the request. This makes it hard for attorneys to know what criteria their clients need to meet. There are also no guidelines for who qualifies for humanitarian parole.Understanding why an immigrant is denied humanitarian parole is especially crucial now that it’s one of the few avenues for asylum-seekers to enter the US, Sachau said. Most immigrants and asylum-seekers at the border are currently being blocked from entering the country under a Trump-era policy the Biden administration has continued to use. Citing an obscure public health law known as Title 42 to contain the coronavirus, the US immediately expels immigrants at the border, blocking them from accessing the asylum system.There used to be Title 42 exemptions for vulnerable immigrants through a lawsuit filed by the ACLU, as well as a separate process by which organizations chosen by the Biden administration identified people who were facing heightened risks in Mexico, but they no longer exist. So now, humanitarian parole is one of the few lifelines asylum-seekers have.Sachau said she expected to have a more difficult time getting asylum-seekers exempt from Title 42 after the settlement talks ended and humanitarian groups stopped working with the government. However, she didn't expect to have them all be ignored or denied for months until attorneys warned border officials that their next call would be to members of Congress.“We really are only submitting the most at-risk, the most vulnerable cases whose lives are threatened if they don't receive safety in the US,” Sachau said.In a Dec. 9, 2021, letter to CBP and Border Patrol, Osborn Maledon, an Arizona-based law firm, called for transparency into the humanitarian parole process and said that while officials have the discretion to approve or deny these requests, their decisions are not exempt from judicial review.Each humanitarian parole denial must include specific reasons in writing that would allow a court to determine whether the decision was legitimate, the letter said. Attorneys argued a lack of response to a request doesn’t meet legal standards that would allow for such a review, and that cursory denials stating the decision was made “on a case-by-case basis” failed to show that border officials had actually used their discretion. Advertisement     The letter also called for US immigration officials to adjudicate humanitarian parole requests in a timely manner and publicize procedures on how to request it, in part because most immigrants don't have attorneys who are willing to argue their case.In response to a message from Sachau asking why a request was denied, a program manager at CBP's Tucson field office said no guidelines exist on what criteria immigrants need to meet for humanitarian parole because they are considered case by case.“I would recommend, although not required, the more documentation provided the better. That gives a better understanding of the situation,” the email added.CBP and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to BuzzFeed News’ requests for comment.Of the 24 humanitarian parole requests that advocates have submitted in Nogales since August, five have been denied and four granted in the past two weeks, Sachau said.“Just because it’s no longer 0% doesn’t mean all the things we laid out in the demand letter aren’t true, and we still have responses pending,” Sachau said.One family waiting to hear if the US will allow them into the country to seek protection has an 11-year-old daughter who has seizures.
 


The Gonzalez family arrived at the Nogales, Arizona, border in July 2021. They were in a taxi near a bus station when men in police uniforms pulled the father, Manuel, out of the car. He was confused because the men were in uniform but they drove civilian vehicles without a police logo. The men asked for 1,500 pesos for each family member, but Manuel told them they didn’t have a lot of money; they took everything he had: 2,800 pesos, or about $137. Advertisement     “They told us to leave and not say anything to anyone,” Manuel said.Scared, the family hurried to an official border crossing and told CBP officers they were seeking asylum.“They closed the door on us,” the mother, who asked to only be identified by her last name, Gonzalez, said. “They didn’t let us speak to anyone else and told us we couldn't be there.”They’re currently renting a room without running water or electricity for about $122 a month. The children are scared of leaving the room because other people who live there are often using drugs, Gonzalez said. They slept on cardboard boxes until a friend gave them a mattress that they all squeeze onto at night.The most pressing issue for the family, though, is their 11-year-old’s seizures. The family has seen doctors in Nogales, Mexico, but they can’t afford the specialists who can diagnose their daughter. They depend on a brother in Phoenix who sends them the little money he has.“It’s very difficult being here when we had jobs and a stable life back home,” Gonzalez said. “But that was taken away.”At their attorney’s suggestion, the family declined to go into the specifics of their asylum case but said they were fleeing death threats.
 


Joanna Williams, executive director of the Kino Border Initiative — a binational nonprofit based in Nogales, Mexico, and Nogales, Arizona, that works with immigrants — said it’s hard for US immigration officials to understand the true lack of access to medical care and security in Mexico. Advertisement     “They view Mexico as a developed country, a country they partner with in many ways,” Williams said. “But there’s a big gap in their experience and the experience of migrants trying to access medical care in Mexico.”Among those also hoping to beat the odds are Ruben and Cesar, a Honduran couple who face daily discrimination for being immigrants and gay. The couple fled Honduras after members of their neighborhood started to threaten them with violence. They knew going to the police wasn’t an option, because authorities had ignored similar threats made against other queer people. So rather than wait for things to get worse, the couple left for the US border last summer.It was a long journey, Ruben said. They slept on the streets, hitchhiked, and were extorted by Mexican authorities along the way but managed to make it to the border.
 


“Even though people say God isn’t with gay people, we’ve seen God’s hand cover and protect us when we slept on the streets or beaches at night,” Ruben said.They live in a room in Nogales, Mexico, crowded with other immigrants; their only privacy coming from sheets that surround the four corners of their mattress. Members of the local cartel are always parked outside, so they try not to go out if they can avoid it. But inside their cramped quarters, other immigrants make anti-gay remarks or laugh at them.“We try to overlook the laughs and the bullying, but it’s not easy,” Cesar said. “The fear is that one day the homophobia will turn into a physical attack.”There are days when the couple doesn’t know how they’re going to pay their rent, and finding a job is even more difficult due to discrimination, Cesar said.“The hardest part about being here is not having the support of any friends or family,” Cesar said. “We’re rejected everywhere we go, and that’s why we try to stay within the walls of our four curtains.” Advertisement     The couple spends most of their days on their phones, watching videos and learning English on Duolingo.“My hope is that one day we can live somewhere where we don’t have to keep hiding, where we can show our affection for each other without fear,” Ruben said.

7,"Brian Laundrie went missing as the search or his fiancé Gabby Petito, and the person responsible for her disappearance, intensified.","


Brian Laundrie claimed responsibility for the death of his fiancé, Gabrielle Petito, in a notebook before shooting and killing himself, the FBI said Friday.No one else appeared to have been involved in the death of Petito, the agency said in what it called its final investigative update into Petito's disappearance and death, which sparked national headlines and a massive social media following after the 22-year-old went missing in September. Advertisement     The couple had chronicled their cross-country road trips on social media and amassed a following of hundreds of thousands of their own, but questions arose when Laundrie returned to his home in North Port Florida on Sept. 1 without Petito. Laundrie was driving the white van the couple had driven in their ""Van Life"" YouTube channel, but Petito's whereabouts were unknown.Gabby Petito's family reported her missing 10 days later. North Port police would later name Laundrie as a person of interest in the case, noting that he'd made no contact with authorities about Petito's disappearance and that he, and his attorney, had repeatedly refused to answer questions about her.Investigators also believe Laundrie used Petito's cellphone multiple times after her death, sending text messages between her phone and his in order to try to deceive law enforcement and give the impression that she was still alive.According to the FBI, investigators also believe Laundrie used Petito's debit card on his trip back from Wyoming to his family's home in Florida.
 


Laundrie's family then reported him missing on Sept. 17. Two days later, Petito's body would be found in Wyoming in the Grand Teton National Park.Officials believe she died of ""blunt-force injuries to the head and neck with manual strangulation.""An arrest warrant was issued for Laundrie on Sept. 22. About a month later, his body was found at the Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park. Near the body, officials also found a backpack with a revolver and a notebook that, according to the FBI, contained statements that he was responsible for Petito's death.Officials did not release further details about the notebook's contents.FBI officials said they did not expect to release any more information about the case.""All logical investigative steps have been concluded in this case,"" Michael Schneider, FBI Denver Division special agent in charge, said in a statement. ""The FBI's primary focus throughout the investigation was to bring justice to Gabby and her family.""

8,"“The close ties across the country means it isn’t hard for things to spread — whether that be gossip, word games, or good public health measures to keep us safe during a pandemic.”","


The success of Wordle, the game most easily characterized by the green-and-yellow square emojis that are saturating Twitter feeds worldwide, traces back to a small group of nerdy New Zealanders who were looking for a pandemic distraction.“The close ties across the country means it isn't hard for things to spread — whether that be gossip, word games, or good public health measures to keep us safe during a pandemic,” said Asher Wilson-Goldman, a public sector communications professional who was one of the first people to start tweeting about the game. Advertisement  New York software engineer Josh Wardle designed Wordle for his partner. Since November, its daily traffic has skyrocketed from 90 users to 2 million.
 


According to data provided by Twitter, since Wardle released the game in November 2021, there have been 1.7 million tweets mentioning ""Wordle"" globally. But a Twitter thread from New Zealand in late November really kicked it off. Advertisement  “Have you been playing Wordle? Like Mastermind (the board game) but for 5-letter words,"" Kiwi web developer David Ritchie tweeted Nov. 24. “I nailed today's in 3 attempts.”
 


Andrew Chen, 29, a research fellow at the University of Auckland who helped the government with its COVID-19 contact-tracing app, saw Ritchie’s tweet. “I like logic and word puzzles generally (stuff like Sudoku and escape rooms), and I really liked Mastermind once upon a time. I was hooked straight away,” he told BuzzFeed News.The premise of Wordle works as such: You have six tries to guess a five-letter word. The game is updated with a new word daily.So Chen started sharing his results under the thread and comparing them with other mutual connections. Which meant that Paul Brislen, a telecommunications executive in his 50s, took note of his Twitter colleagues talking about five-letter words on his feed. A former journalist himself and self-described “word nerd,” Brislen liked the idea of a pared-down, distraction-free game that forced you to “concentrate and use your brain.”
 


Participants followed the golden rule of never tweeting the answer. “That meant there was no feeling of exclusion or being too late to the party,” Brislen said. “I think that was quite important at the start. We were all in it together.”Wilson-Goldman said he encountered the thread still simmering in this small group of Twitter colleagues. “I think when I joined, there were maybe five or six people already playing through the thread, and I already followed about half of them,” he said.
 


More of their Kiwi digital friends began sharing results and number of tries under that same thread every day. It began to get a little chaotic with the flurry of messaging, so Kelsy Fletcher, a New Zealand public servant and longtime connection of Chen’s from school, suggested they use a hashtag instead, and #DailyWordleClub was born.“It felt more like you were indicating that you were part of the club than as a way to collate content,” Chen said.Even the square emojis came directly from the New Zealand crew. Elizabeth S., an adviser to the New Zealand government, found it would be “much easier” to describe their results using colored emoji tiles for an easy, spoiler-free way of sharing. The format caught on among the #DailyWordleClub members — and then Wardle implemented it in the site’s share option.
 


“There was some analysis done a while ago that showed the New Zealand Twitter community is more highly interconnected than in other countries,” Chen said. “I mean, we like to say that there's two degrees of separation in New Zealand.”Google searches for “Wordle” first began spiking in New Zealand around mid-December 2021. This pattern was quickly followed a few days later in Australia after Aussie journalists who follow some of the original New Zealand players saw it and began tweeting. On Dec. 23, Guardian Australia became the first publication to write about it; the outlet embedded six tweets from people playing the game, but only one appeared to belong to someone outside the blue-checked media community.After the Guardian article, searches began spiking in the United Kingdom and Canada. A New York Times reporter based in London profiled the origins of the game on Jan. 3. Since then, Google searches for the term “wordle” have skyrocketed over fifteenfold.
 


The internet has seen similar trends to this before, in which a trend grows from the media’s own personal interest, rather than via organic usage by people who don’t work in media. We saw it happen with “cheugy,” a term resurfaced ironically by TikTok user @webkinzwhore143. The term was pushed into the online zeitgeist after relentless media coverage about it. What began as a casual joke surrounding a teen-fabricated term to highlight millennials’ awkward aesthetic became a widely used word, in part due to media outlets’ immediate gravitation toward it.Often, it’s been journalists building the Wordle trend, as word lovers who play the game, fall in love with it, tweet about it (often from their blue-checked accounts), and then write stories about it, encouraging others to do the same.In just under a month, 228 articles have been published about Wordle. Between Jan. 1 and Jan. 13, 1.2 million tweets containing the green-and-yellow square emojis have been sent.Leading into 2022, the vast majority of tweets around Wordle were coming from New Zealand and Australia — but Twitter shared that the top three countries tweeting about Wordle in recent weeks are the US, the UK, and Canada. Advertisement  But there’s some indication the game is finally moving to other social networks. Last week, several TikTok accounts dedicated to Wordle were created, where users share their results and post memes.
 


And the Kiwi crew who started it all are proud of how they helped the game grow.""I didn't realize we were early adopters; it was just a bunch of people playing a game over summer. But then once the share button was introduced — hats off to Elizabeth for suggesting sharing that way — my Twitter feed is now entirely full of green squares,"" Brislen said. ""I can well understand why some people get angsty about it, as it's gone nuts. But just learn to mute keywords, OK, people?""Here are some tips, techniques, and opening word suggestions from some of Wordle’s earliest adopters:Andrew Chen: “I like to use ‘TIMES’ as a starting word because it has an ‘S’ at the end to quickly tell you if it's a plural word or not. I think there is a general consensus that starting words with lots of vowels are good for narrowing down the number of possible words. There's folks out there who have done analyses of the 2,500 words in the Wordle answer dictionary and determined what the ‘best’ starting words are. But I'd like to think that there are no bad starting words, that everyone can have fun whatever way they like.”Paul Brislen: “My average suggests I need more help than I can give. Usually takes me five guesses to get there, while my wife does them in three. Ugh. Use the ‘FORCE’ (a good five-letter word), try a different starter word each day, remember that what worked yesterday won't tomorrow, and don't forget that double letters are allowed (bloody ‘CLOCK’ ruined my streak).”Asher Wilson-Goldman: “I use ‘SPELT’ as my opening word and love it. It provides a good range of letters while keeping ‘R’ and ‘A’ spare to provide good follow-up word options. I know a lot of people advocate starting with words with three or four vowels, but I think they're wrong — it's much easier to guess vowels than consonants because there are fewer of them.”Thomas Beagle: “I like varying my starting words. One day I'm going to get that elusive first-guess winner! My advice is that you don't have to try to get the answer on every guess; sometimes it's better to ignore the letters you've already got and guess a word with five new letters.”

9,This is the first criminal case brought by a DOJ task force established in response to an unprecedented wave of threats against elections workers and officials nationwide.,"


The Department of Justice on Friday charged a Texas man who allegedly posted a message on Craigslist in which he called for the murder of government officials in Georgia as a runoff election was wrapping up.Chad Stark, 54, was arrested by FBI agents on Friday morning. He is expected to appear in federal court in Austin later in the day, facing one charge of communicating interstate threats.If convicted, he faces up to five years in prison.On Jan. 5, 2021, the day of the Senate runoff election in Georgia and one day prior to the Capitol insurrection in Washington, DC, Stark allegedly posted a $10,000 bounty on the Atlanta page of Craigslist that called on ""Georgia Patriots"" to kill three government figures. Advertisement     ""It’s our duty as American Patriots to put an end to the lives of these traitors and take back our country by force we can no longer wait on the corrupt law enforcement in the corrupt courts,"" he allegedly wrote. ""If we want our country back we have to exterminate these people.""The DOJ did not identify the officials Stark was said to have threatened, but the message also made references to ""corrupt"" governors and judges, as well as law enforcement officers who ""stop Patriot supporters.""On his Facebook page, Stark had expressed his support for Donald Trump by liking the pages ""Trump 2020"" and ""Donald Trump Is Our President.""Stark's is the first criminal case brought by the DOJ's Election Threats Task Force, which was established in July in response to an unprecedented wave of threats nationwide against elections workers and officials.Much of the vitriol was inspired by the former president, who lied to supporters like Stark by saying the election he lost was stolen from him.In a call to reporters on Friday, DOJ officials declined to comment on what role Trump's rhetoric played in fueling the threats or whether they had seen evidence of foreign actors being involved.But Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. told reporters that the task force had reviewed more than 850 similar threats against elections workers and currently had dozens of cases open for investigation.""These unsung heroes came under unprecedented verbal attack for doing nothing more than their jobs,"" Polite said.

A mother threatened to bring ""every single gun loaded and ready"" to her children's school in Luray, Virginia, in opposition to a mask mandate, prompting officials to beef up police security.""My children will not come to school on Monday with a mask on, all right?"" the woman, Amelia King, said during a Thursday school board meeting for Page County Public Schools. ""That's not happening. And I will bring every single gun loaded and ready. I will see y'all on Monday."" Advertisement     
 


A school board member then cut off King because she spoke for longer than the allotted three minutes. As she walked away from the microphone, she said, ""I'll see y'all on Monday.""On Jan. 15, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin reversed the state's mask mandates in schools, allowing parents to decide whether their child will wear a mask to school. However, several school divisions have said they will continue to require students to wear masks. During Thursday's school board meeting, however, the Page County Public Schools board voted that it will be up to parents like King. Advertisement     The incident adds to a number of school board meetings across the US that have become threatening and contentious as divisive national politics make their way to local government.On Friday, Antonia Fox, the division superintendent, and Megan Gordon, the school board chair, said in a statement that there would be an increased police presence at Page County schools Friday and Monday.""Last night at our School Board meeting during the Citizen Comment period there were comments made that referenced weapons and were perceived by many to be threatening in nature,"" the statement said.

Violence and threats are never acceptable or appropriate. This kind of behavior is not tolerated from our students, faculty, staff, nor will it be tolerated by parents or guests of our school division.""Toward the end of the school board meeting, King sent an email to the board apologizing for her use of words.""She wants to apologize for the way she phrased the statement,"" one board member said as they read King's email to the rest of the board. ""She doesn't like to speak off the cuff. 'I in no way meant to imply all guns loaded as in actual firearms but rather all resources I can muster to make sure my children get to attend schools without masks.

11,From a new period drama by the creator of Downton Abbey to a hilarious new ABC comedy.,"


Premiering on Monday, The Gilded Age, this HBO period drama created and written by Julian Fellowes (Downton Abbey), begins in 1882. We follow Marian Brook (Louisa Jacobson), who decides to move to New York City to live with her aunts, Agnes van Rhijn (Christine Baranski) and Ada Brook (Cynthia Nixon), after her father dies. The central tension focuses on the class anxiety felt by old money New Yorkers like van Rhijn and new money folks like George and Bertha Russell (Morgan Spector, Carrie Coon), who live in a palatial home right across the street. The Russells are loaded with cash and initially try charming their way into high society before choosing to take what they believe they’re entitled to by force. Advertisement     Like a lot of period dramas, this one is very white, but there’s an interesting storyline that centers on Peggy Scott (Denée Benton), a Black woman who is an aspiring writer. Peggy’s life becomes entangled with Marian’s after the latter is robbed at the Pennsylvania train station and loses her ticket in the process. Peggy buys Marian a ticket home and both arrive in New York in a carriage meant only for Black passengers. The show really excels at highlighting myriad class struggles and, surprisingly, doesn’t rely on lazy storytelling when it comes to its Black characters. The great Audra McDonald is fantastic as Peggy’s mother, Dorothy Scott. The show is also very funny too, seamlessly going from darker subject matter to things of lighter fare. Baranski’s snobbish Agnes has a lot of great one-liners that will leave you in stitches. “I am not concerned with facts, not if they interfere with my beliefs,” she says in Episode 2.The Gilded Age has a slow start, but the stakes really explode in the second and third episodes, and many characters bypass conventional storytelling tropes, making for a richer narrative. Based on the five episodes made available to critics, I can promise you, it’s the good stuff. —Michael BlackmonWhere to watch: HBO
 


If the end of Insecure has you craving a new show about a group of Black thirtysomethings, this NBC sitcom might scratch that itch. Created by Phil Augusta Jackson, this silly sitcom centers on five friends who get into various low-stakes hijinks in Sitcom LA. What makes this comedy distinct, though, is that most of the friends are Black men. There’s Noah (Echo Kellum), the idealistic rom-com lover who’s always falling for unavailable women; his sister, Nicky (played by the delightful Nicole Byer), a real estate agent who’s always looking for the next hot date; Sherman (Carl Tart), a streetwise underemployed dude; Anthony (Aaron Jennings), a vegan accountant; Wyatt (Justin Cunningham), a stay-at-home husband; and Fay (Grasie Mercedes), an even-keeled bartender. The jokes are just a little more off-center than you’d expect for a sitcom, with plenty of specific pop culture references (a reenactment of a scene from Love & Basketball in the pilot episode made me chuckle). If you’re looking for a good Black laugh, this show is it. —Tomi ObaroWhere to watch: NBC and Hulu
 


Do you ever find yourself nostalgic for those old, messy VH1 reality shows of yesteryear? You know the ones — Flavor of Love, Rock of Love, and I Love New York? Well, you’re in luck, because Hot Haus, which debuts on Jan. 27, is the closest thing to those wonderfully trashy shows from the mid-’00s. And if you thought it couldn’t get any better, it’s hosted by the Queen of Reality TV herself, the one and only Tiffany “New York” Pollard.The show’s conceit revolves around a group of former and current queer sex workers who are in competition to be crowned the next Queer Sex Icon, winning a $10,000 grand prize provided by Scruff. Hot Haus is touted as being sex positive and certainly achieves its aims. I knew I was sold on it when one of the “witchy woo” contestants named Sapphire referred to her vagina as a “plant-based pussy.” But the show, while pretty lewd, has a lot of heart. Another contestant vying for the jackpot, JuJu Minxxx (and they’re “anal about the Xs”), is trans and nonbinary. JuJu takes the judges — rapper CupcakKe, adult video star Matthew Camp, and activist Nicky Monet — to task, calling them out for unfair critiques. Their confrontation is a biting commentary on the ways in which even other queer people can ignorantly hold on to oppressive and limiting colonial standards of beauty. The show is challenging, fun, and queer as hell. Advertisement     If you’re in the mood for a show with a lot of gags, surprises, and endearingly bad CGI, definitely check out Hot Haus. —Michael BlackmonWhere to watch: OUTtvGo
 


Created by Ava DuVernay (When They See Us) and Jill Blankenship (Arrow), this CW drama isn’t your average superhero show. It follows Naomi McDuffie (Kaci Walfall), a 16-year-old whiz kid who runs the third-biggest Superman fan site in the world. During an apparent Superman sighting in her hometown, she hears a strange buzzing, passes out, and awakens with her senses unusually amplified. While the town believes the Superman spectacle was a hoax, Naomi is determined to get to the bottom of the mystery, Nancy Drew style, with her motley group that includes her loyal bestie Annabella and some love interests: Anthony, a townie; Nathan, a military brat; and Lourdes, the purple-haired girl from the comic book shop. Her search for answers leads her to shady residents who know just a bit too much about her and her newfound abilities. This former ordinary girl realizes her small town may just be more super than she thought.This show puts an adopted, Black, and possibly queer teenage girl at the forefront of the superhero narrative, which is unlike anything I’ve seen before. It captures the great ups and downs of teen adolescence while showing that self-discovery isn’t just a part of puberty. When it comes to mystery, supernatural abilities, and a coming-of-age story, it’s giving what it needs to give. —Marlize DuncanWhere to watch: The CW
 


With so many television shows to choose from in today’s oversaturated landscape, it can be difficult to tell if the shows that garner breathless hype and attention are actually as good as people proclaim they are.Thankfully, the acclaim for this ABC comedy created by Quinta Brunson, a former BuzzFeed employee, is much deserved. The show centers on hopelessly optimistic school teacher Janine Teagues (Brunson), who must deal with the complications of being an educator within a Philadelphia public school system with a shoestring budget and very limited resources. The supporting cast is stellar too. The legendary Sheryl Lee Ralph plays Barbara Howard, the practical veteran and foil to Brunson’s effervescent Janine. The handsome Tyler James Williams excels as substitute Gregory Eddie, channeling the vibe of a caring yet reluctant instructor while laying the foundation for what could hopefully become one of the next great sitcom will-they-won’t-they romances as sparks fly between him and the coupled-up Janine. There’s a palpable feeling of love and appreciation for real-life teachers, which is unsurprising given the project’s background. Brunson was inspired by her mother, who taught for 40 years, and the show got its name from a sixth-grade teacher she “adored” growing up. “I got to see behind the veil because I was with my mom in the morning and at night, and I was in her kindergarten class all the time,"" Brunson told PhillyVoice earlier this month.If you were a fan of The Office or Parks & Recreation, especially the mockumentary style those series employed, you’ll definitely be charmed by this show. —Michael BlackmonWhere to watch: ABC on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET/8 p.m. CT, Hulu
 


Paramount’s Yellowstone premiered the same week as Succession, and while the latter has received a mass of critical acclaim and media attention, Yellowstone, with about 10 times the viewership, has become the most-watched cable show in the US with little fanfare. Over the last four seasons, more than 10 million people have tuned in week after week to watch this irresistible, modern-day family melodrama about patriarch John Dutton — played by a weathered, charming Kevin Costner — trying to save his Montana ranch from outside forces that range from greedy developers trying to ruin the landscape with condos to hedge funders’ intent to do even worse. (It finally received its first critical nod with a 2022 Screen Actors Guild nomination for best ensemble in a drama.)Series cocreator Taylor Sheridan (Sicario, Hell or High Water) has built a taut, suspenseful show (that has already spawned spinoffs — the Yellowstone prequel 1883 and forthcoming Texas-based 6666) featuring a family, much like Succession’s, that is fracturing as Dutton tries to secure his legacy. And what a family it is: Beth (Kelly Reilly), the tough-as-nails daughter who is hellbent on preserving the ranch; Kayce (Luke Grimes), the estranged youngest son who lives on a nearby Native American reservation with his family; Jamie (Wes Bentley), the Harvard-educated lawyer who never quite found his place in the Dutton hierarchy; and Rip (Cole Hauser), a ranch hand with a troubled past who serves as John Dutton’s right-hand man, even for his most odious tasks. There’s also a whole cast of ranch hands and cowboys who provide bromance drama — Walker (Ryan Bingham), a smoking hot formerly incarcerated man and burgeoning country singer, is a standout, as is Jimmy (Jefferson White), a rodeo star with a history of addiction.As the show progresses, each character has a role in keeping the ranch from falling into the wrong hands in order to hold on to the Dutton way of life. And while it’s surprising to imagine a man who owns a ranch the size of Rhode Island coming off as an underdog, John Dutton is the guy you’ll find yourself rooting for throughout the series.It seems everywhere I turn, the buzz about Yellowstone is getting louder and louder, so it may finally get its due as a major cultural phenomenon. After a long, unsparing winter, the Montana Tourism Board better get ready for the rush of people who will inevitably come to the state to play out their Yellowstone cowboy fantasies this summer — which is exactly everything the Duttons are fighting against. —Karolina WaclawiakWhere to watch: Stream Seasons 1–3 on Peacock, purchase on Amazon Prime
 


In the entire Housewives universe, only two iterations didn’t fully take off: Washington, DC, and Miami.Miami’s first season, back in 2011, never really coalesced. The only conflict emerged at the tail end of the season over a charity event between Leah Black, the self-proclaimed mayor of Miami, and NBA wife Cristy Rice, never heard from again, who was friends with castmate Larsa Pippen, then a low-key NBA wife herself.A reboot led to two seasons with some great drama, mostly sparked by Adriana de Moura, a Brazilian gallery owner who fought with almost everyone on the cast. Her fiery clashes with model Joanna Krupa, takedown of an influencer dentist with a fake soap star boyfriend, and friend breakup with former bestie Leah all made for TV gold until the series’ abrupt end in 2013.Now Miami is back on Peacock, and the new season is super-charged with the drama and random pettiness that makes the franchise great. De Moura is already clashing with Guerdy Abraira, a chatty event planner with a tell-it-like-it-is style, and flirting with a lesbian former Miss Russia living on a farm; Pippen, now a Kardashian lookalike, has made art out of being on the show seemingly only to promote her OnlyFans account. But most compelling of all is Alexia Echevarria, the self-proclaimed Cuban Barbie, who brings out the franchise’s serious side. Once married to one of the protagonists of Netflix’s Cocaine Cowboys, she’s been open about the difficulties of raising a son with disabilities, of getting her son to mesh with her new fiancé, and about her discovery that her ex-husband was gay. For anyone hankering for more Housewives content or wanting some good mindless reality TV, this is worth a look. —Alessa Dominguez
 


Oh, Euphoria. It’s been more than two years since the HBO drama premiered, with just a couple of holiday specials to keep us sated in the meantime. Those episodes, one-offs devoted to Rue (Zendaya) and Jules (Hunter Schafer), were small-scale by COVID necessity, quiet and thoughtful episodes about Rue trying to convince herself that being addicted to drugs is just who she is — that she doesn’t need to change — and Jules realizing that she no longer wants to center her life on the needs and desires of men. But the new season has once again cranked the volume up to 11, kicking off with a teenage rager of epic proportions and raised stakes: Cassie (Sydney Sweeney) is sleeping with her best friend’s ex, the world’s worst person, Nate (Jacob Elordi), and they nearly get caught; and Rue and Jules get back together, even though Rue casually and cruelly tells her that their breakup was the reason she relapsed.Where we once might have thought of Euphoria as prestige TV, or at least prestige TV–adjacent, Season 2 confirms creator Sam Levinson’s glitzy dark-edged music videos are merely masquerading as narrative television (How many songs can he pack into a single episode?). This show is ridiculous: so self-important, increasingly off the rails. But you can’t deny the music videos sound great and look even better. The young superstars who’ve made the show a sensation are, of course, the most beautiful of all. I’ll keep watching just for Sweeney’s pout, Zendaya’s tomboyish puppy dog act, and Schafer’s zany outfits. I just hope Levinson doesn’t make these poor kids suffer too much.

If you’re looking for a cute French-language watch, get into this show, which I loved back when it first aired in 2018. Elsa (Zita Hanrot), Emilie (Joséphine Draï), and Charlotte (Sabrina Ouazani) are best friends living in Paris. Elsa is getting over her breakup with the vain and self-centered Max (Guillaume Labbé) when Charlotte decides to hire a male sex worker named Jules (Marc Ruchmann) to help Elsa get her groove back. Inevitably, they fall in love. In the last season, which dropped earlier this year, Elsa and Jules are trying to have a baby. Max and Charlotte are dating now, having grown closer during lockdown, causing tension with Elsa. And Emilie and her husband, Antoine (Syrus Shahidi), have decamped for the country with their toddler in tow. There’s a notably more mature theme to this final season as the women grapple with motherhood, fertility, and illness. But the chemistry between the actors continues to charm. —Tomi ObaroWhere to watch: Netflix
 


The last season of this cult show ups the ante to the wildest degree yet but somehow feels like the most plausible end for this darkly comic satire about a quartet of self-involved Brooklyn millennials. In the final season, Dory (Alia Shawkat), who has transformed from an insecure and directionless personal assistant to a polarizing femme fatale, achieves her final role as a cult leader. Having been dead for a few minutes and revived, she seeks to spread enlightenment to the rest of the world. Her friends — long-suffering ex Drew (John Reynolds), naive Portia (Meredith Hagner), and vain Elliott (the hilarious John Early) — come along for the ride and find financial backing in a bizarre tech billionaire named Tunnel Quinn (Jeff Goldblum). It’s a fantastic return to form for the series, which somehow manages to be more lighthearted and even funnier about the literal end of the world. —Tomi ObaroWhere to watch: HBO Max ●

12,The app Noom claims to rely on science and psychology to help you lose weight. But it may not be that different from any other deprivation diet.,"


I keep getting this ad for the Noom app, served up with so many YouTube videos and cable TV shows that I feel uniquely targeted by them. It begins with a supercut of an attractive young man clearing plate after plate at restaurants, waving off waiters while a folksy cover of “Where Is My Mind” by The Pixies plays. Then he stares agape at his phone while his bros sit around him eating snacks and drinking beer. “I was conditioned to finish my plate since childhood?” he says, astonished; we see a flashback of a kid mopping up the last of an egg while his father glares at him. “When it comes to losing weight, it’s psychological,” the voiceover says. The message: Noom is different. It will help you get thinner the smart way.Much of Noom’s advertising leans on this “not like the other girls” characterization. “Stop going on a diet. Start going on Noom,” one ad says. “The last weight loss program you’ll ever need,” another says. The people who work there use the same framing. “We think of it as a health and wellness tool,” Noom President Artem Petkov told me over Zoom last year. “It’s a psychology-minded type of education. It’s how you teach people the behavioral science of these things, to empower them. That’s ultimately what gets you control.”But if I google “diet,” the first result is a Noom ad (your algorithm may vary). Noom’s core offering is called Noom Weight, which “empowers participants to achieve and maintain a healthy weight through lifestyle intervention.” One prong is a general “health” program, and there’s another for those looking to manage their diabetes, but it’s clear that at least one major purpose of Noom is to help you lose weight — key elements include calorie deprivation, daily weigh-ins, and text that emphasizes losing weight. Noom says it wants to help you lose weight “sustainably,” meaning gradually, long-term, and through behavioral changes as opposed to rigid rules and elimination diets. In one Noom ad, a woman talks about how she lost 87 pounds, saying that in order to lose the weight, she had to — and here, she taps on her head — lose the weight. Advertisement  “We consider ourselves to be a digital health platform,” a Noom spokesperson told me via email this month. “Calling Noom a diet is like calling a car an engine or a ship a sail — it’s a part of the vehicle but not the whole picture.” (Noom also has a newer offering called Noom Mood, designed to “help you develop the techniques, emotional awareness and resilience to reduce stress and live a happier life.”)Noom does differ from its competitors in two ways. First, its novel app-based approach explains the “psychology” of what you’re choosing to eat, why you’re eating, and when you’re eating. “We use gold-standard principles from psychology (CBT, ACT, DBT, etc.) to help users understand why they should and how they can create healthier behaviors — not just what to eat,” a Noom spokesperson told me via email. The goal is to teach your brain to overcome bad habits and unnecessary calories. Cravings are contextualized as emotional eating, and emotional eating as conquerable.Second, it’s much more expensive than some other options; a monthly Noom membership is around $60, while comparable Weight Watchers services, for example, run to about half that price. But none of this really differentiates Noom from the diet programs and apps it seeks to define itself against. Ultimately, its aims are the same: to help you eat less, so you can weigh less.
 


We might as well get this out of the way: Diets don’t work. It’s been proven many, many, many times. Even if they might help you lose weight in the short term, you’re more likely to gain that weight back than to actually keep it off. Deprivation diets in particular impact your metabolism, making it even harder to keep that weight off in the future. (That’s why a lot of The Biggest Loser contestants struggle to keep their weight down after they leave the show, which reportedly restricts what they eat to under 1,000 calories a day.) Because of an antiquated idea from the early 1900s, most deprivation diets targeted at women function on a 1,200 to 1,500 daily calorie allotment, which is essentially equivalent to the appropriate amount of food for a particularly large dog. Diets that require you to cut out entire food groups — like the keto diet or the Whole30 program — could fail in similar ways. Even if you do lose weight, you’re unlikely to keep it off, and at worst, your metabolism slows down long term.Noom has one other similarity with its competitors: Its approach suggests that losing weight is simply a psychological game, but that’s not necessarily true. Psychology is just one influence, because biochemistry, genetics, and environment play a role too. The way Noom sees it, cravings and caloric needs beyond its guidelines are compulsions that your mind can crush. But do understanding and modifying your thoughts really help if you live in a food desert? Can you mind over matter yourself out of starvation mode while eating far less than what your body actually requires to function optimally?Perhaps the most significant difference is really Noom’s marketing itself, which has successfully reached beyond the traditional weight-loss audience of women to also target men. Noom ads feature a lot of men, and the app seems to have a higher percentage of male users than others in its category. (When asked, Noom would not confirm their user demographics.) Unlike wellness and diet programs marketed to women (like Gwyneth Paltrow’s juice cleanse routine), which are usually promoted using the flowery language of self-care and beach-body imagery, Noom presents itself as rooted in science. It’s based on psychology and hard facts. It’s a diet app that’s dressed up in a therapist’s blazer and slacks, giving you advice on how to change for the “better,” telling you that if only you could just get out of your own way, you could do the impossible and make this diet work for the rest of your life.It’s not like Noom invented the idea of men dieting. Keto-based plans are often marketed to men and 10% of Weight Watchers’ users are men. Back in the 11th century, William the Conqueror lost weight by going on a liquid diet of nothing but alcohol and became thin enough to resume riding his beloved horse. (In 1087, though, he died in a riding accident.) In the ‘50s, people started drinking apple cider vinegar to stay thin, something that Lord Byron did in the 19th century. And in the ‘60s, “The Drinking Man’s Diet” was introduced, advising men to drink as much alcohol as they’d like, while eating fish and steak. Advertisement  In 2019, the diet market reached a record $78 billion in the US alone (there was a small decline in 2020 because of the pandemic). And the male weight-loss market is steadily growing; for the last decade, Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig have seemingly also been refocusing some of their energy to capture the male market. In 2018, Atkins brought in Rob Lowe — their first male spokesperson — to promote their products to other men. When I google “diets for men,” Noom is right at the top, promising to change your life in just 16 weeks.
 


Noom was founded in 2008, the brainchild of 42-year-old Saeju Jeong, who came up with the idea after his father died of lung cancer 20 years ago. Raised in South Korea, Jeong started his first business — a record label — at 19 before moving to the US in 2005 and launching the app in 2016. “We want to help many lives, as many as we can, by changing behavior,” he told me in an interview last year. “Weight management is the most effective and efficient way to deliver health. It’s simple. It’s powerful.” Advertisement  14 years later, Noom is generating $400 million in revenue and is gearing up for a $10 billion valuation once it launches an IPO, which could happen this year or in early 2023.The diet industry has changed significantly in the last few years, turning away from promoting weight loss and toward “wellness.” If a “diet” is defined as a restrictive program used to lose weight, then the language of wellness is often employed for a softer, gentler approach. Weight Watchers is now called WW, sometimes referred to as WellnessWins. The low-carb Atkins diet is now about “a life well lived,” and Jenny Craig’s site has a Healthy Habits section with suggestions that go beyond weight loss.By also co-opting the language of wellness, Noom has effectively captured people’s attention — the app reportedly has 50 million users worldwide. Investors like Serena Williams and WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum have lent high-profile shine as well: “Noom’s mix of empathetic human support paired with modern technology and science makes it possible for people to achieve significant, lasting behavior change,” Williams said in a 2019 Noom press release.
 


But what anti-diet nutritionists and therapists see are the same old diet culture rules, just wrapped up in a different skin. “I think it’s a good example of diet culture shape-shifting,” said Evelyn Tribole, a registered dietician and one of the coauthors of Intuitive Eating. “We’ve seen Weight Watchers rebrand because they’re trying to move away from dieting. You can call it whatever you want. You can say you’re using mindful tools. In the end, when you’re counting calories and categorizing food and tracking your weight, it’s a diet.”When you give Noom any of your information, it talks back to you like a comforting coach, someone who’s on your team no matter your goals. Despite that, it does operate just like a diet, albeit one made to look like a gamified MyFitnessPal. The interface for Noom looks a little like a board game, your marker steadily moving along the path every day you use it. The app quizzes you and rewards you with encouragement when you get the right answers. It gives you the endorphin rush of checking off a box on a to-do list.Even before you sign into the app, the Noom website asks a series of questions to hook you, along with some very enticing charts of a person’s potential weight loss. (Noom claims it can help you lose one to two pounds a week.) When you respond to a questionnaire that asks about health risks like diabetes or high blood pressure, it coos back, “We’re really glad you shared. Weight loss is an important goal, but Noom’s mission is helping people get healthier, whatever that is for them.”The questionnaire also asks whether you have an “active diagnosis” of an eating disorder. (If you say yes, it suggests you talk to a therapist instead of continuing to sign up for Noom.)Like many other web-based diet programs or trackers, the Noom app requires you to input all your calories and movements. It categorizes your food: green (largely fresh fruit and vegetables), yellow (lean meats and dairy), and red (desserts, saturated fats). Your green allotment is limitless, while just a couple hundred calories of red is permitted a day. When you eat a green food, the app chirps back, “Great choice — Enjoy!” but red foods come with the warning, “Limit your portions.” (Calorie counts for each category are listed in small print.) You’re prompted to weigh yourself daily so the app can track your “progress.” If you forget to log into the app for more than a day or two, you’re sent a text to remind you to get back in there. The app assigns you daily tasks, like reading summaries of peer-reviewed studies about how to be more “mindful” when you’re stress-eating.
 


You also get a series of motivational sticky notes that say things like, “Stop saying I wish. Start saying I will,” and “Great things never come from comfort zones.” Another day, it’ll present you with a PowerPoint-like presentation featuring the definition for metacognition, “a fancy psych term that describes an awareness and understanding of one’s thoughts and thought processes.” You are told to “embrace” the “journey.”Like Weight Watchers, Noom assigns each user a coach to work with one-on-one — the company employs 3,000 coaches across the country, all trained as dieticians, psychologists, or therapists — as well as a support group, where users can keep each other on track. “We have a lot of customers who might not get the weight loss that they want to get, but what we hear all the time is, ‘I feel different as a person,’” Andreas Michaelides, chief of psychology at Noom, told me last year. “‘I have a different relationship with food. I have a different relationship with my body.’”But the psychological element is exactly what may make Noom potentially harmful. When you fail at Noom, you don’t just fail the way you might fail a typical diet — physically, because your body needs more food or is craving calories or comfort — but you also fail psychologically.Both Tribole and her Intuitive Eating coauthor, nutrition therapist Elyse Resch, have had clients who have used Noom but kept struggling with an unpleasant and complicated relationship with food. “It becomes a mindfuck for our patients, because they think, Oh my god, I tried the psychology and it doesn’t work,” Tribole said.

And as with other diets, it seems inevitable that many users will fail Noom’s program. “They’re telling you it could be mind over matter, but it’s not possible. The survival part of the brain is going to do whatever it can to keep you alive,” Resch said. “You can learn how to have power over [other habits] but not something that’s so physiological and neurochemical. You cannot overcome that unless you’re priming yourself for a very serious eating disorder.”“This has an impact, causing food obsessionality, food worry, food anxiety, feeling like you’re lost, out of control eating,” Tribole said. She likened a diet to being pulled underwater by an ocean’s riptides. “When a big set of waves come, you go under and you hold your breath. When you come back up, you can take a big breath: ahhhh. No one denigrates you, Oh my god, you’re addicted to air. This is what happens when you restrict your eating below what your body needs it to be. You’re going to be gasping for food.”I tried Noom twice, and both times I failed. I lost a little weight, but not much — the app told me to consume just 1,200 calories a day, which was not nearly enough for my 5-foot-5-inch frame. I binged every night; I felt like a failure. But Noom considers failing a part of the process. “The psychological tools we teach are geared towards a holistic understanding of how people can use their self-awareness to change any type of behavior,” a Noom spokesperson told me. “We hear many instances of people who might not lose the amount of weight they wanted when they came into the program but leave with a great deal of other meaningful improvements [like] self-esteem, self-compassion.”Using these apps is different for everyone, and some people I spoke to did have success losing weight. But others said they had trouble like I did, which impacted their sense of self-worth.“When I joined Noom, I was probably at my leanest and strongest. Physically, I was my most capable,” said Kate (who asked to be identified by a pseudonym), a 27-year-old woman who tried Noom in 2019. “Once I got on Noom and I had to weigh myself every day, that deteriorated. It overpowered how strong I felt in my body. Those weigh-ins definitely messed with my head.”The dozens of women I spoke to about Noom had some version of this story: They joined the app to lose that last 10 pounds, or to work on their relationship with food, and were instead rattled by the weigh-ins and the tight calorie count (“Almonds are a red food,” Kate said, incredulous). They also didn’t find the psychological element that helpful. Most of the women were raised in some form of diet culture, meaning that they already knew some of Noom’s tips — like taking a sip of water between bites to slow you down — and decided the app might not be worth $60 a month.“[It’s] mental gymnastics and rhetorical pretzel-twisting to say this isn’t about weight, it’s about psychology,” Christy Harrison, registered dietician and author of Anti-Diet, said. “I’ve seen Noom try to convince people it’s not about the numbers and you’re not a failure if your weight doesn’t change, but how does that square with making people weigh themselves every day, and using a traffic light system to categorize foods? Of course that creates a sense of good and bad foods.”Even the app’s framing of how you eat can feel weaponized. Take, for example, the way Noom talks about cravings, describing them as an “inner elephant,” an “impulsive, irrational, emotional side.” Noom wants you to tame your elephant, to make it behave. But that really means you should behave. “The emotional eating piece really gets to me, the way it demonizes emotional eating, meanwhile creating the conditions for it to happen,” Harrison said. “Of course you’re going to feel so deprived after a few days or weeks of a 1,200 calorie diet. I would be crawling out of my skin.” Also: an elephant? Really? Come on.
 


Noom’s appeal to men makes a lot of sense in the context of the male-dominated trends of bio-hacking and self-optimization. Last year, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey claimed to follow one of the most horrific diets I’ve ever heard of: one meal per weekday, and a full weekend of fasting. (This is a version of intermittent fasting — which is usually a 16-hour fast, or one 24-hour fast a week, and not two full days of starvation, which is an unhealthy routine.) There are fasting clubs in Silicon Valley. The tech-obsessed track every calorie and step with interactive watches and rings, and a lot of those devices are targeted specifically to men looking to optimize their bodies and brains. “It’s not quite as extreme as Jack Dorsey’s intermittent fasting thing, but it’s still this instrumentalization of your relationship with food, putting it into the realm of intellect and numbers and apps,” Harrison said of Noom’s method. “I have seen men for whom Noom was the trigger — it was the straw that broke the camel’s back of severely disordered eating.” Men make up around 1 in 3 or 1 in 4 cases of eating disorders, but many of them rarely get treatment.The app might also speak to men because they are traditionally not very practiced in talking about their feelings, especially around food, and Noom seemingly provides a space to do so, or at least think about food a little differently. “Often men have a harder time accessing their feelings and acknowledging that they have eating issues,” Resch said. “This guides them along so maybe their brains find that more accessible.”For men, longstanding diet tips might actually feel new — especially because Noom presents them as digestible factoids. For example, for every calorie you burn, you get half a calorie back for your food intake. Noom explains it thusly: “When you create a calorie deficit, you’ll lose more weight. It’s math. And science.”“It has that sciency veneer, the emphasis on psychology. This is going to teach you how to rewire your brain, that speaks to men,” Harrison said. “It’s funny how common those diet rules are for women.” For men, meanwhile, those rules are framed as brand new, and much more revelatory for their eating habits. Advertisement  None of the men I spoke to said they were unhappy with the app. 32-year-old Alex Thibodeau told me he has been using the app for around four months — he started after getting targeted ads on Instagram — and said he had lost around 10 pounds. “I think what led me to sign up for it was the alleged promise of it being psychological,” he said. “They make using their app habitual. The prompting they do keeps you addicted. It makes me feel more accountable.”Thibodeau said his progress on Noom has plateaued, but felt this was more to do with him than the app’s failings. “I didn’t feel as though it was a scam in the way that I feel a lot of apps tend to overpromise and underdeliver,” he said. “The shortcomings I’ve experienced with it are more to do with my lack of interest than the effectiveness of the app.” (Tribole said that was another unique characteristic of diets. “[Dieting] is the only industry that blames the consumer, and the consumer believes it,” she said. “It’s gaslighting 101.”)For 55-year-old Chris McNaught, it’s not the theory so much as the accountability element that has proved useful. McNaught said he lost around 60 pounds on Noom in six months. (He regained 20 pounds after quitting the app, and has since rejoined.) “I’m actually a licensed professional counselor,” he said. “[Noom] hasn’t taught me anything I didn’t already know, but they put it in concrete terms for me, why I think about food the way I do and the habits I repeat.” McNaught said that Noom helped him break one of his unhealthy eating habits, namely going to Sonic after playing golf, even if he wasn’t hungry. ‘That was one of my ‘fog’ eating scripts,” he said, using Noom’s term for consuming food when “not fully present.” “I’m just trying to establish a new normal. I’m not going to be on Noom forever.”
 


At 5 feet, 10 inches, Thibodeau was told by the app to eat around 1,900 calories a day. McNaught, at 6 feet, was told to eat just 1,500 calories. Some of the men I spoke to (all around 5 feet, 7 inches or taller) reported that they were told to consume between 1,500 to 2,000 calories a day. This, simply put, is not enough. (When I asked Noom if they considered this amount of food sufficient for adult men, they said yes. “There are a variety of inputs that get individuals to a recommended calorie goal — all based on safe and scientifically-proven research,” a spokesperson said. “Noom’s calorie budget is not a rigid recommendation but a starting point, and users have the option to manually adjust their goal.”) According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, intake for men should generally range between 2,400 to 3,000 calories a day.“This is ridiculous,” Resch said. “They will feel starved on this calorie allotment.” Resch mentioned the 1944 Minnesota Starvation Experiment, where men spent three months eating a diet of 3,200 calories a day, followed by six months of 1,570 calories a day (split into breakfast and lunch). The semi-starvation phase led to decreases in strength, stamina, body temperature, heart rate, and sex drive. The men became obsessed with food, fantasizing about it, becoming more depressed and irritable as time went on.Men may be an important market for Noom and its competitors because women are starting to diet less. Over the last three decades, fewer people have been dieting in general, but women are leading the charge against traditional diet programs. “There’s this growing movement towards body positivity, weight inclusivity, and anti-diet movements. That has really taken hold for women and also trans folks and marginalized folks, a little more so than [for] cis straight white men,” Harrison said. “The diet industry in general, and maybe Noom in particular, is looking to expand their market base.”Last week, a friend who lives on the West Coast texted me from his parents’ house. He’d seen that ubiquitous Noom ad while watching sports on TV. He was surprised — when was the last time he saw a diet ad during a football game?The funny thing about that ad, which features the man finishing his meal, is that it focuses more on how he eats all his food than why he originally felt obligated to eat everything on it. The way his dad glares at him while he does it is striking. How did his father make him feel about not finishing his plate, or conversely, about eating “too much”? What kind of psychological trauma might be tied up between him and his relationship with food? There are plenty of factors at play if someone is eating beyond satiety or undereating, if someone’s relationship with food is fraught and painful and demoralizing.Which is what makes Noom so frustrating for some people. The point of Noom, like most wellness-based diet programs, is still to get you to lose weight. And just because you’re using psychological tools in hopes of reshaping your brain into eating less food, less frequently, it doesn’t necessarily mean that those are healthy habits. Knowing that you’ve been conditioned to eat a certain way doesn’t mean you’re bound to change in a holistic, healthy way. “People don’t have to track their calorie count, their exercise, label foods, weigh themselves every day,” Harrison said. ‘There’s another way to live, beyond all this obsession.” ●If you’re dealing with an eating disorder and need someone to talk to, the National Eating Disorders Association helpline is 1-800-931-2237; for 24/7 crisis support, text “NEDA” to 741741.

13,"“There’s just anxiety that we’re not going to be able to do what we say,” said the chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.","


The planet is warming and there are more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human activity than ever. President Joe Biden’s proposed $500 billion in climate spending baked into the Build Back Better bill is currently stalled out. The midterm elections are looming.One year into Biden’s presidency, his administration is facing more pressure than ever to deliver meaningful action on climate change.“I think it’s anxiety,” said Brenda Mallory, chair of the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), in an interview with BuzzFeed News. “There’s just anxiety that we’re not going to be able to do what we say, and that really worries people because real people’s lives are affected by that.” Advertisement     Last year, Biden tasked Mallory’s team with a massive mission: to lead the way on overhauling the government to better serve and respond to low-income communities and communities of color, especially for climate-linked programs and funding.Specifically, in an executive order signed his first week in office, Biden launched the Justice40 initiative, laying out a governmentwide goal of delivering 40% of the benefits of all federal climate, clean energy, and pollution cleanup programs to disadvantaged communities. The Council on Environmental Quality was left in charge.The combination of fast-approaching project deadlines and the resignations of two CEQ officials in recent weeks — Cecilia Martinez, senior director for environmental justice, and David Kieve, the public engagement director — has thrust this little-known office into the spotlight.“Expectations were high — and they should be high because people’s lives are at risk,” said Mustafa Santiago Ali, senior leader at the National Wildlife Federation and an Obama-era environmental justice official.In her first interview since the staff departures, Mallory addressed the scrutiny, reflected on the past year, and laid out her office’s goals for 2022.“I’m just trying to make sure that we are — we, the team — are head down and are really trying to do as much as we can to deliver on what we have committed to,” she said.Mallory still called 2021 a year of “incredible transformation” for the government’s environmental justice work, pointing specifically to the creation of the White House Environmental Justice Advisory and Interagency councils.And, of course, the Justice40 program launched.“Equity,” Mallory said, is now central to any federal program that touches on climate change. The question now is how to fully implement that concept.This is exactly what her office is trying to figure out. To that end, the White House last July released interim guidance on how federal agencies should think about the 40% goal and identify programs that would be impacted. Most, if not all, federal agencies delivered an update on this in December, according to Mallory.“And so all of that sets us up for 2022,” Mallory said.Perhaps the first step will be the release of the administration’s environmental justice scorecard, a tool for helping track the performance of the Justice40 initiative.The Biden administration initially said the scorecard would be released this February. But that may not happen, Mallory acknowledged. “I think our main aim for that is definitely the first quarter,” she said. “I won’t swear to February.” Advertisement     Mallory also declined to put a date on the release of final Justice40 guidance or the launch of a climate and environmental justice screening tool, which will include interactive maps to help officials define and identify disadvantaged communities. But she seemed optimistic both would get done this year, even if she couldn’t say how soon.Although Mallory did not go into detail on why some staff recently left her office, she said new hiring would happen. The office “will certainly have at least one person coming in,” she said, “but I wouldn’t be surprised if there were more.”That’s on top of the hiring of at least one new official working explicitly on environmental justice in December, bringing the current numbers of staffers dedicated to this subject to six, not including the chair, according to Council on Environmental Quality.Ali was cautiously optimistic to hear this, as someone who has been calling on the White House to keep expanding its staff working specifically on environmental justice. “There’s a need to make sure that those positions are filled as quickly as possible with qualified individuals, and to expand out additional folks who are needed,” he said.Mallory, though, did not bat away complaints from activists who are frustrated by her office’s speed in their first year.“We also would like to be going faster,” she said.
"
14,Jamie Lynn made several messages public in an attempt to clear her name after revealing she’s been called an “abuser” and a “human trafficker” over her alleged complicity in Britney’s conservatorship.,"In spite of the backlash caused by Jamie Lynn Spears’ appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast last week, part two of the episode has now been released. If you missed it, Jamie Lynn appeared on Alex Cooper’s podcast on Jan. 18 to discuss her alleged involvement — or lack thereof — in her sister Britney Spears’ conservatorship. Speaking out against the legal arrangement last June and describing its terms as “abusive,” Britney told a judge in court that her family, including Jamie Lynn, did “nothing” to help her. Under the conservatorship, which came into effect in 2008 and was terminated in November 2021, Britney’s life and financial affairs were strictly controlled by her father and lawyers. Jamie Lynn faced widespread criticism after the episode was released, not just from fans who argued she shouldn’t be speaking out before her sister does, but also from Britney herself. Britney called Jamie Lynn a “selfish little brat” in a harsh Instagram post shared shortly after the podcast aired, while her lawyer, Mathew Rosengart, swiftly filed a cease-and-desist request urging the Zoey 101 star to refrain from commenting on the matter further. Jamie Lynn’s lawyer issued a near-immediate response, however, arguing that Rosengart's request “fails to specify any legal wrongdoing whatsoever.” And amid the ongoing criticism, part two of Jamie Lynn’s guest appearance was released on Jan. 20. Speaking with host Alex once again, Jamie Lynn began by addressing the threatening messages she’s been receiving from fans who say she “didn’t do anything” to help Britney, noting that they’re the “most hurtful things” she's been sent. “I think they want me to not exist,” she said of the people who send her abusive messages. “And if I do exist, it needs to be only to support someone else’s life. I can exist and also support, but also protect myself.” Jamie Lynn then stated that she had no part in the conservatorship before providing Alex with the relevant legal documentation. “[I was] never involved in the conservatorship, never, not once. There are legal documents that I can show you,” she said. “I never had one part in anything, ever, in Britney’s conservatorship or her life at all. Jamie Lynn Spears was never involved in any capacity in the conservatorship. Legally documented, factually documented, by her own team,” she maintained. Discussing why people may think she was involved with her sister’s money, Jamie Lynn claims that Britney once asked her to act as a trustee. However, Jamie Lynn explained that she didn’t follow through with the request. “My sister asked me to oversee a trust if something were to happen to her,” Jamie Lynn said. “When I was approached by her team of lawyers... I did not even follow through with the steps to be a trustee.” She added that it “never even had anything to do with the conservatorship.” She then explained, “When you’re in a conservatorship, everything you do has to be reported to the court. It’s like, if she buys this, or does that, it all has to be reported ‘cause the court has to be held accountable if — heaven forbid — the worst happens.” “During this time, one of the things that happened was my sister asked me if something were to happen to her, would I oversee a trust for her boys,” she said. Jamie Lynn said, “I never even became the trustee of this thing, and that is documented by her team. They filed papers,” before going on to read the documents directly. “In the Court approved First Amendment to the SJB Trust in 2018, the SJB Trust was modified to have Jamie Lynn Spears appointed as Trustee,” she read. “Petitioner [Britney’s team] is informed and believes that Jamie Lynn Spears never undertook any of the steps to actually become Trustee.” And Jamie Lynn later clarified that she didn’t want to be involved in a conservatorship that she didn’t “necessarily trust.” “I didn’t wanna sign anything that connected me to the conservatorship... I wanted no part of the conservatorship. So even signing a trust for the boys — I did not want to agree to it because it was still under the umbrella of the conservatorship. Everything was,” she said. Jamie Lynn went on to address why she didn’t speak out on Britney’s behalf over the course of the conservatorship given that the pop star had limited access to a phone and social media. “As far as I’m concerned, I would message her and I would talk to her, and we had full access to talk to her. I was in contact with her,” Jamie Lynn said, adding that she doesn’t know why people think Britney didn’t have a phone. “I didn’t understand sometimes where or what my position was, or how I could be helpful,” she said, claiming that Britney would sometimes “block” her without giving a reason. “But also, I was dealing with my own dynamics in our relationship, and I was getting to a place where mine and her relationship was becoming a bit more challenging and unhealthy for me.” “But, as I’ve mentioned previously, any time she told me she wanted help, I gave her the chances and opportunities and the people to help her. She knows all of that. Why wouldn’t she just have clarified that and stopped all of this?” she questioned. Jamie Lynn then went on to address Britney’s numerous Instagram and Twitter posts, in which she often puts her “family” on blast for their lack of support. “I felt like a lot of them were directed at me at times,” Jamie Lynn said. “And it made me feel like, ‘why is she doing this to me?’’ Jamie Lynn added that she’s messaged Britney about the posts and the abuse she’s received from fans as a result. She said that Britney apologized, and she went on to directly read a text from her sister to prove her point. “I know it's not your fault and I’m sorry for being so angry at you. Although I’m your big sister, I need you more than you need me, and always have,” the text reads. Following up the interview with a segment filmed virtually on Jan. 18, Jamie Lynn addressed the huge backlash that she faced after part one of the podcast was released. In a bid to calm the criticism, Jamie Lynn gave more specifics about how exactly she tried to help Britney put an end to the conservatorship, explaining that she introduced her sister to a new lawyer during a trip to Hawaii without their parents. “We talked a lot about a lot of different things, and she expressed to me that she wasn’t happy with her situation,” Jamie Lynn said. “So I kind of did a bit of digging myself, as far as calling some lawyers to people I know at home.” “After doing that, I talked to my sister about some information... Personal information that I thought maybe could be useful to give to her lawyer at the time to help shut down this whole conservatorship,” she said. “We spoke about it, she said she wanted to do it, so we gave all of these facts to her lawyer [Sam Ingham]. And then those same facts were regurgitated to me from the other side of the conservatorship. So I know that he obviously immediately went and told them whatever I said... I just think she needed a new lawyer,” she said. Jamie Lynn said that after becoming uncertain about Sam’s intentions, she pushed for Britney to take residence in Louisiana, their home state — something she understood would help “dissolve” the conservatorship. She then went on to read a text that she sent to Britney on Nov. 11, 2020, offering advice about getting out of the conservatorship. She said she also sent the same message to Britney’s fiancé, Sam Asghari, the following day to help ensure it was read. In the lengthy text, Jamie Lynn tells Britney that she didn’t think that Sam Ingham — who was her court-appointed lawyer at the time — was acting in her best interest, and neither were their parents. “PLEASE READ, IMPORTANT INFO that you should know, because it seems concerning to me,” the message begins. “Mom and her lawyers have been in constant contact with Sam [Ingham] about everything, and I first found that strange since you and mom are not even speaking. I did not understand why mom would be involving herself or inserting HER opinion to YOUR lawver ESPECIALLY if you did not ask her to,” it says. “I think she has your lawyer fighting more for HER agenda, then yours and it's only delayed your progress, and cost you more money,” Jamie Lynn writes. She goes on to question Ingham’s integrity as a lawyer before clearly stating that she “NEVER trusted” him. If you didn’t know, Ingham ended up resigning from his role in July 2021 after Britney announced in court that she wanted to choose her own attorney. “He also made so many mistakes at this last court date, which is why you were denied once again,” Jamie Lynn writes. “I don't know if he did such a bad job on purpose, but it's strange that a lawyer would leave so many holes in his petition, which made it an easy denial.” She goes on to tell Britney that their father, Jamie Spears, wanted to resign from his role in her conservatorship before adding that she was “sick” of the ongoing legal battle and wanted to help. “I have nothing to gain or lose in this situation, no matter what happens with the conservatorship but I am sick of seeing this whole thing just keep Going in circles, so l figured I should see what I could do to help,” the message reads. “l am upset that it's lead to me not speaking to mom, but I think it's the right thing to do for now, so that you know everything and aren't constantly being fed bull shit,” she writes. “I have no reason to send this to you, other then I love you, and I'm trying to be helpful. I'm here if you need anything. Love you,” she adds. Jamie Lynn clarified that she hasn’t mentioned all of these details previously because she’s been “afraid” of the personal and legal repercussions. And after sharing the message, Jamie Lynn concluded by saying that she now hopes she and Britney can resolve their relationship “privately,” adding that she only chose to share the texts publicly in a bid to end the ongoing speculation around her complicity. “I get called everything, from an abuser to a human trafficker... This is my life,” she said. “Look what's happened to my family when all these people have inserted themselves... We need to separate it all and just be a family again, or else, we’re just gonna end up back where we started.” “When every headline’s gone away and everything is done, you’re still gonna be my sister. It doesn’t matter. And people need to stop inserting themselves into our situation and egging it on and encouraging it,” she said. “All I wanna do is love and support my sister, and end this nonsense. This is ridiculous,” she added."
15,"“I think in many ways, we are just as flabbergasted as the rest of society about how Omicron has seemingly come from nowhere,” one scientist said.","


The Omicron variant’s worldwide surge has upended early hopes for returns to normalcy and points to a more uncertain future for the pandemic, some experts say. The advent of the variant has shaken many scientists who were once confident that they had a handle on SARS-CoV-2.“I think in many ways, we are just as flabbergasted as the rest of society about how Omicron has seemingly come from nowhere and seemingly spread so quickly,” said infectious disease expert Jacob Lemieux of Massachusetts General Hospital. Advertisement     First identified in November, just two months ago, Omicron has led to global case reports of around 3 million new cases a day worldwide, nearly a fifth of them in the US. In the last week, cities such as New York, Boston, and Washington, DC have reported signs that COVID cases have started to decline, echoing earlier drops seen overseas in the United Kingdom and in South Africa.The CDC’s assembly of forecasts for COVID cases project the US peak coming nationwide in the next two weeks, heading up to 800,000 new cases a day before a sharp decline. Those same forecasts predict COVID-19 deaths approaching 3,000 a day in the US in February — nearly doubling the current, already awful rates — as the variant cuts its deadly swath through the country.
 


“We are going to have a tremendous number of deaths among the unvaccinated,” said immunologist John Wherry of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. “And we’re going to have — even if we manage to eke our way through this — the scar tissue in the health system, which is going to last for a long time and is not going to be something that recovers when infection rates go down.”Shaken scientists, meanwhile, are reassessing their understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the aftermath.In three months, the Omicron variant has dramatically redefined how bad a COVID surge can be, even when vaccines are readily available. The new reality raises hard questions about what will happen after Omicron recedes.Here’s everything we know about what might happen next.Will there be a lull?In South Africa and the United Kingdom, a steep decline in Omicron cases has raised hopes that the winter surge will be followed by a spring lull. With increased population immunity from vaccination and the tornado of infections that has swept the US, as well as the rollout of hundreds of millions of antiviral pills promised by the Biden administration for this year, it’s possible the next chapter of the pandemic will be that of a virus in retreat, one defanged but not defeated.
 


Scott Hensley, a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania, told Stat that he expects those factors will make Omicron the last wave of the pandemic. Coronavirus infections continue in this case, but they rarely lead to deaths or hospitalization. We return to a world without masks, shuttered offices, or canceled public events.But many other scientists are less optimistic. They argue that there are no guarantees that US case numbers will fall to where they were before the Omicron surge began, for example.
 


“I don’t know, unfortunately, that we can rely on what’s happened in other countries and expect that’s going to happen here, because it hasn’t in the past,” said immunologist Deepta Bhattacharya of the University of Arizona. The US experience with past surges has been a sharp peak and then a gradual decline that instead never really settles down to particularly low case numbers.The aftermath of Omicron may be a patchwork of different experiences, both around the globe and across the country. “We’re starting to get a sense of what happens now after Omicron,” Lemieux of Massachusetts General Hospital said, speaking Tuesday at a briefing for reporters. “And we’re seeing not a single consistent behavior.”In some places after an Omicron surge, there is a resurgence of the Delta variant. In others, Omicron has been replaced by a sister “stealth” lineage of the Omicron variant called “B.A.2,” seen rising in Denmark and India. That means the post-Omicron pandemic may look different everywhere.“I don’t think we’re out of the woods yet. I do think things will get better,” Lemieux said. “But we’re going to have to keep a really close eye on the evolution of this virus because that has continued to be a major factor in the pandemic to date, and I don’t expect that to change.”Is Omicron really that different from the other variants?It’s possible that we may eventually see Omicron as just another variant that caused one of many surges in a long-running pandemic. So far, the World Health Organization has tallied five “variants of concern,” with Omicron only the latest. Each one has told scientists a little more about the SARS-CoV-2 virus.But among scientists, there is wide agreement that Omicron has been a landmark variant. They say its arrival is a turning point in the pandemic, though no one knows what it’s pointed us toward.“Oh, I think it’s a very significant, very, very significant event,” Wherry said. He said many members of the scientific community were surprised that a variant like this could emerge.Clearly observable factors, such as Omicron’s large number of mutations, higher transmission rate, and ease in piercing through vaccine immunity, are all forcing a recalibration in thinking about the virus.“Omicron has been both surprising and concerning from a scientific perspective,” said immunologist Shane Crotty of the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. It was surprising that the variant picked up so many mutations, more than 50 overall, and transmitted itself so well. It shook preconceptions of how much room the virus had to evolve. “That’s concerning both for immunity and efficacy of vaccines, but also the future of the pandemic.” Advertisement     “It shows that this virus is more flexible than most of us had expected,” he said. “That’s worrisome.”Omicron sports 32 mutations on the spike protein that the virus uses to latch onto cells. That’s about three times more than in past variants. The fact that the virus could change so much and remain infectious forces scientists to consider a wider field of possibilities for future mutations of the virus.“The bet was that the virus couldn't have very many mutations without the spike protein just becoming a mess,” Crotty said, “but somehow it managed to do that and still be pretty functional, which means looking into the future, the virus might be able to do a lot of that repeatedly.”Do Omicron’s milder effects mean future variants will be less severe?Statistically, Omicron does appear less likely to lead to death than the previously dominant Delta variant. A recent Case Western Reserve preliminary study of 84.5 million patient records, still not peer-reviewed, found the risk of hospitalization or death from Omicron was less than half of Delta, for example.“Anecdotally, this surge feels very different on the wards,” said pediatric infectious disease expert Andrea Ciaranello of Massachusetts General Hospital at the Tuesday briefing. Doctors are seeing many more cases, but far fewer pregnant women are being sent to an ICU or need to be urgently intubated or induced at her hospital. “I think we may be benefiting from our very high vaccination rate here.”However, the risks are still real, Ciaranello added. Scientists are still trying to untangle whether Omicron truly causes milder disease, or whether it just seems milder because more vaccinated people are getting sick and they are largely protected from the worst outcomes.“Being mild, that’s the biggest misconception right now,” Crotty said. “Definitely in vaccinated people, Omicron has almost universally been mild, and that’s fantastic.” But all that means is that the Omicron variant is still about as deadly as the original, wild-type virus, though it is less deadly than Delta, he said. “The original strain obviously caused huge problems.”Moreover, he called the notion that viruses inevitably evolve to become less deadly to their hosts “a fairy tale” that might make it easier to sleep at night, but offers no insight into the future of the coronavirus. Advertisement     Rotaviruses, which kill hundreds of thousands of children worldwide from diarrheal disease every year, have evolved to become more virulent, for example. A Viking Age sample of a smallpox virus reported in 2020 suggests that the virus, which famously killed 30% of the people it infected in the 20th century, was once a milder disease.While in the big picture killing your host might be a bad idea for any virus that wants to spread, the double-barreled nature of a COVID case complicates such thinking about SARS-CoV-2, Bhattacharya said. The virus first infects the nose, throat, and mouth, transmitting new infections to new hosts from there, and only invades the lungs days later, a stage of the disease that doesn’t matter to the spread of the virus. Thus lung infection is not all that important to its evolution. But infecting the lungs is what kills people. “If the truth is that it is intrinsically more mild, that’s happenstance,” Bhattacharya said. This means whether the next widespread variant is more or less dangerous than Omicron is just a matter of chance.The threat of a more deadly and more transmissible variant arising is more than just theoretical. Some of the mutations (related to the fusion of an invading virus to a cell) that made Delta more dangerous aren’t carried by Omicron yet, but they have been spotted on a few versions of the variant in a few places, Crotty said.“It’s not some distant hypothetical thing,” he added. “It is a concern right now. People are watching around the globe for this intently.”On the plus side, the ability of coronavirus vaccines to stand up against severe disease is encouraging after Omicron, he said, and a testimony to the immune system. “It’s like you showed the immune system one kind of coffee mug, a round thing with a handle, and from that it was able to recognize every kind of mug that you can imagine. It’s remarkable.”Will humanity have heightened immunity after Omicron?Probably. The huge number of infections caused by Omicron will likely leave behind some kind of strengthened immunity against the coronavirus in its wake. Around 60% of the world’s population has now received at least one vaccination as well, which changes the landscape faced by the virus. Advertisement     “We do have a degree of population immunity now that means, if you have immunity, the chances of you ending up in the hospital or having real life-threatening consequences are dramatically lower,” said Wherry, the Penn immunologist. “And that’s a game changer.”Just how much immunity an Omicron infection adds to anyone’s armory is uncertain, however, and might vary from person to person, depending on the impression an infection left on their immune system. “I’m sure that there’ll be a new variant at some point. The question is whether Omicron might buy us a little more time before the next serious variant of concern,” Bhattacharya said.On the other hand, just as Omicron’s mutations added up to a big jump away from past variants, the next serious variant might be a big jump in a different direction. That seems more possible now because Omicron showed there is extra maneuvering room for the virus to mutate significantly and still infect.The coronavirus infects everything from lions to deer, and billions of people remain unvaccinated, providing plenty of hosts for new viral evolution.“I and other people who are thinking about this are a little reluctant to say, ‘Yeah, [Omicron immunity] will buy us more time,’ because Omicron kind of came out of left field,” Bhattacharya said.This means the really big remaining need after Omicron is to vaccinate the globe, Ciaranello said. “We saw the last couple variants emerge from largely unvaccinated populations.” She said we may have gotten lucky with Omicron, which is sending fewer people to the ICU in her hospital right now. “We may not get so lucky next time. And we really need to continue to push the vaccine makers and the government to get vaccines to the globe.”In the long run, the combination of global vaccination and whatever immunity comes from infections should at some point result in a final wave of the pandemic. For other coronaviruses, ones that cause common colds, new variants of concern typically arise every three to five years. Hopefully at some point, SARS-CoV-2 evolves into that groove, causing colds but not disrupting life.“Whether that’s 18 months from now, or 18 years from now, I’m not sure,” Wherry said. “But that’s likely where we’re gonna end up.”

17,Jamie Spears filed to unseal Britney’s medical records and claimed that “the public has the right to know” the “truth” about the star.,"Britney Spears’ controversial conservatorship officially ended in November 2021 after 13 years of her professional and personal life being largely controlled by her father, Jamie Spears. During last year’s legal fight for freedom, Britney Spears made a series of accusations against her dad and told the court: “My dad and anyone involved in this conservatorship and my management who played a key role in punishing me, they should be in jail."" She testified that she was forced to have an IUD in her body to prevent her from having more children, was not allowed to get married, and was forced to take mood-stabilizing medication. Speaking about her father, Spears said: “He loved the control to hurt his own daughter 100,000%.” She went on to recall being forced to go to rehab, telling the court: “I cried on the phone for an hour, and he loved every minute of it. Anything that happened to me had to be approved by my dad.” Jamie Spears agreed to step down as his daughter's conservator in August, three months before the conservatorship was officially terminated. But the drama is far from over, and Jamie Spears was caught up in fresh allegations from Britney Spears' lawyer Mathew Rosengart on Wednesday. Rosengart filed legal documents claiming that Jamie Spears took “over $6 million” from Britney Spears throughout the conservatorship and that she now wants him to pay back the money. According to TMZ, Rosengart has accused the pop star’s dad of engaging in “self-dealing, financial and business mismanagement,” and that he “engaged in abusive and bullying conduct toward his daughter, [and] deprived his daughter of fundamental civil liberties.” The lawyer maintains that Jamie Spears had no right to the money, part of which was allegedly used to pitch a show called Cookin’, Cruzin’ & Chaos. And the $6 million is just the tip of the iceberg, with Rosengart going on to claim that a further $30 million of Britney Spears’ money was used to pay for lawyers for the conservatorship. The money is also separate from the profit that her father is reported to have made through his cut of Spears' performances and merchandise sales, with previous legal documents claiming that he received 1.5% of gross revenue generated by Spears. “Gross revenues for box office alone were approximately $137.7 million, plus merchandise sales,” the report states. “Mr. Spears' cut from that residency is estimated to be at least $2.1 million. He also received a 2.95% commission on Ms. Spears’s gross revenues on her 2011 Femme Fatale tour, which yielded him an estimated $500,000.” During court on Wednesday, Britney Spears' lawyer also called out her father for his “offensive” and “highly inappropriate” request to make her medical records public. People reported that Jamie Spears' lawyer, Alex M. Weingarten, approached Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny about unsealing Britney Spears' health records next month. In his request, Weingarten said that “the public has a right to know” the “truth” about the singer’s health, and that Spears and her legal team are driving public sympathy via the media. In his immediate response to the request, Rosengart stated: “We don’t think a father who loves his daughter would file to unseal her medical records.” He called the motion “offensive” and “highly inappropriate.” Judge Penny rejected Jamie Spears' request due to his daughter's “right to privacy over her private medical information.” Jamie Spears isn’t the only family member that Britney Spears has remained at war with since the end of her conservatorship, with the singer regularly speaking out against her sister, Jamie Lynn, on social media. Following the release of Jamie Lynn’s memoir, Things I Should Have Said, and the subsequent promotional interviews, Spears accused her sister of using her to sell the book and making up “crazy lies.” One thing that Jamie Lynn Spears was accused of lying about is a childhood memory of her sister locking them both in a room with a knife. Discussing the alleged incident on Nightline, Jamie Lynn Spears said: “I was scared. That was a moment I had. I also was fearful to really say anything because I didn't want to upset anybody, but I also was so upset that she didn't feel safe.” Britney Spears took to Twitter shortly afterward to call her sister “scum” as she vehemently denied the allegations. “Please please stop with all these crazy lies for the Hollywood books,” she wrote. ”Now and only now do I know only a scum person would make up such things about someone.” And on Tuesday, Spears responded to her sister breaking down in tears in a new interview by writing: “I’m sorry Jamie Lynn, I wasn’t strong enough to do what should have been done… Slapped you and Mamma right across your fucking faces!!!!!” Shortly afterward it was reported that Spears' lawyer had sent Jamie Lynn a cease-and-desist letter that threatened legal action if she continued to speak about Spears during the book promotion. “We write with some hesitation because the last thing Britney wants is to bring more attention to your ill-timed book and its misleading or outrageous claims about her,” began the letter, obtained by Page Six. “Although Britney has not read and does not intend to read your book, she and millions of her fans were shocked to see how you have exploited her for monetary gain,” it goes on. ""She will not tolerate it, nor should she."" Referencing the sisters’ dad, the letter reads: “You of all people know the abuse and wrongdoing Britney had to endure during the conservatorship, after initially growing up with a ‘ruinous,’ alcoholic father. In fact, your own book reportedly states that your father ‘spent most of my life in that cycle of ruinous behavior. His bouts of drinking caused me periods of torment and sorrow.” Rosengart then explains: “Publicly airing false or fantastical grievances is wrong, especially when designed to sell books. It is also potentially unlawful and defamatory.” “You recently reportedly stated that the book was ‘not about her,’"" it says. ""She takes you at your word and we, therefore, demand that you cease and desist from referencing Britney derogatorily during your promotional campaign. If you fail to do so or defame her, Britney will be forced to consider and take all appropriate legal action."" Jamie Lynn Spears' book was released on Jan. 18, and two other people who are mentioned in the memoir have also come forward to accuse her of lying about them — one of her former Zoey 101 costars and Britney Spears' ex-manager."
18,"We haven’t fully grasped exactly what the power of a TikTok mob, fueled by a For You Page, can do.","


This is an excerpt from Please Like Me, BuzzFeed News’ newsletter about how influencers are battling for your attention. You can sign up here.This week, TikTok was overrun by the saga of a man whose bad dating history turned him into the new Couch Guy. It’s also a tale of an online mob swarming a private citizen whose crimes didn’t exactly fit the public shaming and reputation-ruining punishment. Advertisement     A New York woman posted a TikTok about getting ghosted by a guy named Caleb, someone she met on Hinge. Something strange happened in her comment section: Multiple other women replied, “West Elm Caleb?”It turns out that several women all had similar experiences with the same twentysomething mustachioed West Elm furniture designer they met on the dating app. He had ghosted them after a few dates or texts and did some classic fuckboy moves.That these women had all found each other was indeed a surprising coincidence (or maybe not, considering that since they were all contacts in Caleb's phone, the platform probably connected them). By Wednesday, “West Elm Caleb” had become a full-on TikTok meme, and women who had matched with him were posting photos of his face. “POV: you’re a mom in SF that just spent an hour deep diving on West Elm Caleb tiktok instead of doing the dishes,” one wrote, noting that she had just found his LinkedIn.The outrage spilled onto Twitter, and then tabloids and media sites, which published his full name. A rival dating app painted a billboard of his Hinge bio.People’s reactions were vehement. Caleb’s behavior was predatory and abusive, and he needed to be called out publicly. But did he actually do anything so bad?Caleb declined to comment on the record for this story.Here are list of his supposed wrongdoings:He ghosted people. That’s rude, and even the lunkheads on Love Island know how to politely say “I’m sorry, I’m not feeling a connection.” But this is standard dating behavior.He allegedly sent at least one person an unsolicited nude photo. That’s gross, and it suggests some lack of respect for women and a lack of understanding about boundaries. But he wasn’t sending it to a coworker or woman friend; it was to someone he was flirting with on a dating app. Context matters. This is bad behavior, but it’s not full-on cancelable, and it’s not even unusual with someone you met on a dating app.He recycled the same Spotify playlist and claimed he had made it just for them. This is cheesy but funny that he was caught.He’d “lovebomb,” or show a ton of initial interest over text. Lovebombing is regarded as a precursor to abuse. But there were never any accusations of abusive behavior, he just ghosted.He lied about his Hinge usage. One woman who went on one coffee date with him said that he told her it was his first Hinge date. He told someone else after a few dates that he had deleted the app.He played a numbers game: trying to match with tons of people, messaging, and going on plenty of dates but not seeming interested in a relationship.Lastly, he was dating several women at once. One woman pieced together that she had slept over at his place on a Friday night, woke up there on Saturday morning, and that another woman on TikTok met him for a date later that night.I’m sorry but, like…we’re all grown-ups here, right? If you’re shocked by the idea of a young single person in NYC having sex with more than one person they’re casually dating, there’s a whole TV show from the 2000s I’d love you to check out. It’s got really great outfits.Caleb got away with a lot of bad behavior because he’s cute and tall. He is clearly a bad dater, and he evidently did some disrespectful stuff to the women he was talking to or going out with. We shouldn’t just excuse men for being jerks; we should be able to expect more from them. I agree!But the punishment does not fit the crime. For ghosting a few dates, he has received a brutal internet pile-on that would make Tucker Carlson want to crawl into bed for a week.
 


Something got out of hand, fast.In 2013, Justine Sacco tweeted an offensive joke about the AIDS epidemic in Africa before boarding a long flight. While Sacco was in the air, her tweet hit a viral outrage cycle. Sacco lost her job and gained overnight infamy. In hindsight, she was a victim of that moment in Twitter culture, where it felt like a daily outrage machine that needed fresh meat to chew up each day. She was a case study about the consequences of online mobs for Jon Ronson’s book So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed.A few slow news days before the Jan. 6 Capitol assault last year, the internet was transfixed by Bean Dad, a podcaster who tweeted what he thought was a funny story about refusing to show his daughter how to use a can opener. Twitter exploded in rage that this was child abuse. After days of Bean Discourse, the country’s attention turned to something much more pressing.
 


To some degree, Twitter has gone through several cycles of debating about what it means to get the pitchforks out and make someone the Main Character. There’s some consensus about worthy targets having some form of power, or at least being a public persona (exceptions can be made for incidents of horrifying racism, like the story of Central Park Karen).But TikTok as a culture hasn’t gone through that process yet. We’re collectively not totally sure what “TikTok culture” is if we’re not talking about D’Amelio dancing videos. This is new ground. One of the OG women who'd posted about Caleb later followed up on Thursday asking for people to not dox him, but it was too late. Even at a product level, TikTok isn’t designed for conversation; replies and follow-ups are hard to find. Advertisement     The scale and proportions of TikTok virality have always given me vertigo. Things get sucked into some mysterious For You page where you’re shown content that TikTok chooses for you. There are TikTok stars who build a steady following, but a lot of what people see is one random nonfamous person with a single video that blows up.What started with a John Tucker Must Die moment of women’s empowerment — women looking out for each other! — quickly morphed into something sinister and ugly. I don’t think we’ve fully grasped exactly what the power of a TikTok mob, fueled by a For You page instead of a retweet, can do.

19,"The star’s beloved wife and daughters were by his side when he died on Jan. 20, 2022.","Iconic rocker and actor Meat Loaf has died at the age of 74, his family confirmed on Facebook on Thursday. Originally from Dallas, the musician, who was born Marvin Lee Aday and also went by Michael, had his loved ones by his side when he died on Jan. 20. “Our hearts are broken to announce that the incomparable Meat Loaf passed away tonight surrounded by his wife Deborah, daughters Pearl and Amanda and close friends,” the Facebook post read. “We know how much he meant to so many of you and we truly appreciate all of the love and support as we move through this time of grief in losing such an inspiring artist and beautiful man,” the statement continued. “We thank you for your understanding of our need for privacy at this time,” his family went on, before adding: “From his heart to your souls… Don’t ever stop rocking!” Meat Loaf was most renowned for his Bat Out of Hell trilogy, with the first album of the three making history as one of the bestselling records of all time. His impressive career spanned six decades and saw the star sell more than 100 million albums worldwide. In 1994, Meat Loaf won the Best Solo Rock Performance Grammy for his hit single “I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That).” In addition to music, Meat Loaf enjoyed an impressive acting career, starring as Eddie in the 1975 musical film The Rocky Horror Picture Show (below) and opposite Brad Pitt as Robert Paulsen in 1999 hit Fight Club. Bat Out of Hell was also turned into a stage musical, which was written by Meat Loaf’s longtime collaborator Jim Steinman and premiered in the UK in 2017. Meat Loaf was famed for his theatrical performances and impressive vocals, and admitted to turning down an offer to “make a lot of money” from opera, which would have utilized his distinctive vocals that ranged three octaves. In 2010, he told the BBC: “[I] had an offer to study opera and make a lot of money but it wasn't for me — I'm too rebellious, too crazy. I made the right choices. I have no regrets. [It] might have saved some of my voice, you know — doing 200 rock shows a year will take it out of you."" Meat Loaf was also open about the various health issues he dealt with over the years, including asthma that caused him to collapse on stage during a 2011 concert. And in November, Meat Loaf told fans that he was still in “a lot of pain” following four back surgeries, the most recent being in February 2018. He wrote on social media: “I now have 13 screws holding on a metal plate or plates in half my back.” Despite his discomfort, Meat Loaf went on to share his plan to return to the recording studio this month having written seven new tracks. The Facebook post read: “On or about January 4th, we are in the studio. Playing live, rehearsing live, recording all Basic Tracks on a 24 track analog recorder (old school).” Addressing the handful of new songs, Meat Loaf continued: “Yes, only 7 new songs but and a BIG BUT. Live tracks from (oh goodness I'm not that old) the ‘70s, great ones a great band and Jimmy on piano, the ‘80s, so many great live tracks in the '80s, great bands, the '90s and again a great band and so many great shows, 2000's (how do you write that) great shows great band. “Then tracks up till I hurt my back (I have now had 4 back surgeries) The back surgeries hurt everything.” News of Meat Loaf’s death has rocked the world of showbiz, with Cher among the famous names to pay tribute after working with the star on his 1981 album, Dead Ringer. She tweeted: “Had so much fun with Meat Loaf when we did 'Dead Ringer'. Am very sorry for his family, friends, & fans. Am I imagining it, or are amazing ppl in the arts dying every other day?” Musician Boy George shared a funny memory with fans as he recalled: “R.I.P Meatloaf. Love and prayers to all his family and close friends. He once turned me upside down in a Chinese Restaurant in St Johns Wood.” And musical theater icon Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote: “The vaults of heaven will be ringing with rock. RIP Meatloaf. Give my best to Jim (Steinman).” Meat Loaf is survived by his wife, Deborah (below), and his daughters Pearl, 47, and Amanda, 41."
20,The theory is based on texts citing the overthrow of Serbia’s government in 2000.,"


At a detention hearing for a member of the Oath Keepers on Thursday, federal prosecutors floated a new theory: When roughly two dozen members of the armed extremist group prepared to storm the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, they were expecting police to join them and the rest of the angry mob.The theory is based on messages in which Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes compared the group’s efforts to the overthrow of former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic more than two decades earlier.Rhodes sent the messages just four days after the 2020 election, evidence shows, and included a step-by-step guide on how protesters forced the Serbian authoritarian to resign, which included storming the Balkan nation’s parliament building. “Police and military aligned with the people,” one message read. Advertisement     Although no such alignment took place on Jan. 6, the Oath Keepers were successful in their attempts to delay certification of the election, Louis Manzo, a trial attorney for the Department of Justice, told a federal judge at the hearing in Phoenix. As a result, he added, Rhodes never felt the need to call in the group of heavily armed members of the Oath Keepers — referred to as the Quick Reaction Force, or QRF — that he had stationed at a hotel across the Potomac River.One of the alleged commanders of the QRF was Edward Vallejo, who drove from his home in Phoenix and had stated his willingness to participate in what he called a “guerilla war” if Joe Biden were instated as president. Vallejo, a 63-year-old Army veteran who lives in Phoenix, was arrested last week and charged, along with Rhodes and nine others, with seditious conspiracy as well as other crimes.Thursday’s hearing was set to determine whether he would be held in continued detention. Prosecutors, arguing that he should remain in custody, claimed he brought a large stockpile of armaments as well as a month’s worth of food to the hotel, that he attempted to launch a drone to spy on National Guard and US Capitol Police during the riot, and that he conducted a reconnaissance mission in the District of Columbia the following morning.Debbie Jang, a public defender representing Vallejo, argued that her client was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community and should be allowed to return home while awaiting trial. She noted that he had not tried to escape or hide evidence, even after the FBI seized his cellphone last spring, and added that he did not have a passport and had never left the country.Federal Judge John Z. Boyle was unpersuaded, however, stating that Vallejo “crossed a very serious line that could have led to the death and injury of many people if it had gone forward.” He denied bond to Vallejo and ordered that he be detained and transported to Washington, DC, where several other members of the Oath Keepers who were previously charged in the case are currently detained.Vallejo’s unsuccessful attempt to stay out of jail may presage another detention hearing scheduled for Monday morning: that of Rhodes, who was arrested last week outside of Fort Worth, Texas, and, like Vallejo, is charged with seditious conspiracy and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. Advertisement     Since first filing charges against members of the Oath Keepers nearly a year ago, prosecutors have signaled that Rhodes was the intellectual driver of what they have painted as a well-organized conspiracy aimed at the heart of American democracy. Manzo described Rhodes as “a dangerous man who is waging war on the US.”Court records show that two DC-based prosecutors have filed to appear at Rhodes’ hearing to argue for his detention. That hearing was scheduled for Thursday as well but was delayed because Rhodes had been placed in quarantine for potential COVID exposure at the facility where he’s currently being held.If convicted, Rhodes, Vallejo, and the other defendants in the case face up to 20 years in prison. Most of the defendants face additional charges, including obstruction for allegedly destroying or deleting records from their phones and other devices.

22,Jamie Lynn tries to take back her narrative while painting a portrait of toxic family dynamics.,"


Even at the peak of Britney Spears’ celebrity, her success story was inextricable from her family. Her mother, Lynne, often appeared alongside her on TV, beaming with pride as she talked about raising a future pop star on Oprah or MTV. Their relationship was packaged in books, like the 2000 scrapbook memoir Heart to Heart and a saccharine YA novel, 2001’s A Mother's Gift.And the youngest born, Jamie Lynn, was part of the package too. She often popped up in the background of Britney’s TV specials, goofing off and looking like a mini Brit. Hamming it up for the cameras led to more professional acting, like a spot on Nickelodeon’s tween version of SNL, All That, and eventually her own show on the network, Zoey 101, which premiered in 2005. Advertisement  But then the family’s image started cratering. First came Britney’s public divorce and tussles with paparazzi in 2007, which culminated in a battle with her parents and the establishment of a conservatorship. That same year, Jamie Lynn Spears became pregnant at 16, making her prime tabloid fodder.For over a decade, neither Britney nor Jamie Lynn really talked in depth about what it was like growing up in their family or living up to their wholesome images. That changed in 2019, as #FreeBritney led to the pop star speaking out about what she saw as her family’s abuse of her conservatorship. “I would like to sue my family,” she said in court, bluntly. And since then, the public has been litigating the family’s actions. A lot of the spotlight has been directed at dad Jamie, who became the face of the conservatorship. But the Britney stan army has also questioned the support of her mother, the actions of her brother, and most recently the involvement of her sister, whom Britney unfollowed on Instagram after some exchanges about Jamie Lynn’s new memoir, Things I Should Have Said.The book is a sometimes revealing, if often elliptical and grammatically challenged, story about the toxic patterns caused by growing up in a show business household. “My siblings and I have been traumatized by the distorted vision my parents have of loyalty and success,” Jamie Lynn writes. “I want Britney and the world to know she isn’t the only one who is left with scars from our early years of delinquency and manipulation.” It’s also the latest chapter of the family’s very public processing of what feels like an ongoing reality show. Advertisement  
 


It’s well known that Britney’s early years were turbulent as the family supported her show business dreams, struggled financially, and dealt with patriarch Jamie’s reported alcoholism. “Momma was often working and taking care of the family,” Jamie Lynn writes. “She was also dealing with the complexities of an addict husband.” (Her parents have not publicly responded to any of the allegations Jamie Lynn makes about them in her memoir.)Britney had to become like a “second mother” to Jamie Lynn, she writes. And the children were all expected to aid their mother, including in covering things up to avoid their father’s anger. Advertisement  For instance, according to the memoir, when Britney crashed a car that her mom had let her drive, Lynne quickly changed seats with her so Jamie wouldn’t lash out. “We all pretended — said things or stayed quiet,” Jamie Lynn writes, “to make sure Daddy was placated and their relationship remained intact.”
 


The parents traveled a lot, to be with Britney as she worked toward her dreams, and then especially as she became a huge superstar. “Momma reveled in the attention that came with being Britney’s mother,” Jamie Lynn says. “People were more interested in who she was than ever before, and I think she loved that part of it.” The implication is that Jamie Lynn often felt like an afterthought.The dynamic of Britney being more of a mother figure than Lynne continued even after she became one of the biggest pop stars in the world. Britney encouraged her little sister’s camera hog tendencies, making her the star performer behind the scenes of her early tours. Soon, Jamie Lynn was doing commercials for Clorox and Pepsi. Eventually the Nickelodeon show premiered, and both Lynne and Jamie Lynn moved to California.Maybe because she’s still trying to protect her mom, the book has a tendency to just state events relating to their relationship, without really diving into how Jamie Lynn actually felt about them. She says she froze with anxiety during her first day on the All That set, and her mom shot her a disappointed look. It’s unclear if the look felt threatening or scary; she notes the rest of the cast was “nurturing,” and she was able to perform.Later on, she writes about how Lynne slams a heavy purse against her during a fight, but quickly moves on to another anecdote about her father. In other interviews, she has explained that the outburst was partly a result of the strained dynamics of her being the breadwinner (like Britney). But in the book, the implication is that Lynne was overwhelmed and frustrated from the labor of being a momager, especially to Britney.
 


In interviews promoting her memoir, Jamie Lynn has emphasized that she’s only comfortable talking about how things in her family impacted her, and isn’t trying to write about her sister. But judging by the memoir, Britney’s actions impacted the entire family all the time, in part because they all seem so dependent on her real-world success.“I loved having her on set and her visits gave us a chance to catch up,” Jamie Lynn writes about her Nickelodeon years. “It didn't hurt ratings either.” One wonders what it felt like for Britney knowing that her presence wasn’t just sisterly bonding but a ratings boost for her sister’s show in a family that, like the Kardashians, seemed to always be mixing their personal lives with business.
 


Jamie Lynn writes that the period of Britney’s relationship with Justin Timberlake was the happiest time for the whole family. After that breakup, she says, she started seeing changes in Britney’s behavior toward her. In some of the writing that has made headlines, she observes that Britney became “disturbed and paranoid at times.” She writes: “Sometimes she would lash out for no apparent reason and ignore me. Invariably, Britney would feel bad and later apologize.”Jamie Lynn also calls Britney “erratic,” remembering, “One time she said to me, ‘Baby, I’m scared,’ and took a large knife from the kitchen, pulled me along to my room, and she locked us both inside.”Britney tweeted out a denial of that specific claim. But regardless of its truth, it comes off obtuse that Jamie Lynn feels comfortable exposing such intimate scenes of her sister undergoing a mental health crisis, using pathologizing language like “disturbed” and “erratic.” Throughout the memoir, she often seems to have a limited understanding of living with mental illness and the power dynamics involved.Still, Jamie Lynn admits that she wasn’t fully knowledgeable of Britney’s issues, nor involved in addressing them, and emphasizes that as this was happening, she was dealing with her own issues as a teenager, feeling lonely without her friends from back home. She fell into her first real relationship with a fellow teenager she calls Casper, which eventually led to the pregnancy at 16 in 2007.And right before Britney was placed in conservatorship in 2008, Jamie Lynn was put through the Spears machine just like her older sister. She started feeling sick and tired, and her management ignored her. “Team Jamie Lynn assumed I was just being a typical moody teen and pushed me to keep working,” she writes. (She often uses that “team” moniker to avoid specifying who is responsible.)
 


When she told her mom about her pregnancy, the entire “team” wanted her to have an abortion and break up with her boyfriend. “They took my smartphone away, fearing the news would get out, and insisted that no one share any information with anyone, especially the press.” They sent her to a remote cabin in the Northeast, and she was terrified and didn’t know where she was.She threatened her parents with emancipating herself, and they finally relented. She points out they let her keep the baby and continue the relationship because emancipation would put her earnings at risk, but doesn’t expand on what that felt like or what she now thinks about how her parents handled the situation.
 


The memoir isn’t all about the Spears family. Big chunks of the memoir are about Jamie Lynn branching out on her own, her attempts to record a country music album, and her struggles to unlearn the pattern of accepting unacceptable behavior from unreliable men. She married her current husband, had another child, and last made headlines in 2017 when her older daughter had a life-threatening accident with an ATV.Still, because of the renewed attention on her family since the conservatorship ended, it’s as if she felt compelled to address Britney’s claims, especially in the last chapters. She writes that her relationship with Britney finally came to a head during the pandemic when Britney screamed at Jamie Lynn while she was carrying her daughter, and it made her feel unsafe. Her mom told Jamie Lynn not to upset her sister, and she writes that it triggered her anger over years of putting Britney first.“I was taught to defer to Britney or behave in a way that made things easier for her,” she writes. “Momma said stuff like ‘Come on, Jamie Lynn, we don’t want to upset your sister.’ It could be something as simple as ‘Let Britney do that first’ or ‘if it’s good for your sister it’s good for all of us.”But that sentiment comes out of nowhere in the book, especially because there are no illustrations of that dynamic earlier. In fact, she paints the opposite portrait, of her sister as a caring, mothering figure in earlier chapters. At least until she became a woman in pain, who seemed to be up against the same family issues Jamie Lynn confronted, while also struggling with serious mental health challenges. (In recent tweets, Britney has said that she was the one suffering from dutiful daughter syndrome: “But see I always was the bigger person. They all got to DO IT and PLAY ME, and I always sat there and took it.”) Advertisement  Now 30, Jamie Lynn is still struggling with her relationship with her older sister and parents. “It’s hurtful for me to work through this,” she said on a podcast about digging into her story. “It’s still painful and I’m still processing it, but part of the main steps is actually saying it out loud.”That might be why she often prefers sticking to broad clichés rather than insights gleaned from specifics. “Maybe imposing unrelenting demands on teenage performers who are in the midst of complicated developmental periods places them even more at risk,” she writes, in one statement of the obvious. “I don't know. I do feel that fame and fortune, coupled with the pressure, can lead to negative coping mechanisms that can cause irreparable damage.”
 


And yet even after Britney’s lawyer argued in court that Jamie exploited his daughter and had her mental health weaponized against her, Jamie Lynn toes the family’s party line in blaming the Svengali-ish part-time manager Sam Lutfi for the troubles that led to the conservatorship. “When Sam Lutfi had infiltrated her life, the sister I knew was vanishing,” she writes. “The amiable Britney was gone. In her place was an agitated woman, angry enough with Momma to yell at her in public. It was the first time I was ever embarrassed by her.” (Lutfi has publicly denied all her allegations and threatened a lawsuit.)That twentysomething Britney had reason to be angry, or frustrated, with her parents, just like Jamie Lynn is now, isn’t something she addresses at all. The book is full of such curious omissions. The memoir doesn’t appear to make the connection that her team’s pressure for her to end a pregnancy and banishing her to an undisclosed location echoes with her sister’s own situation years later. She presents a glowing portrait of Lou Taylor, the manager now under investigation for alleged improprieties with Britney’s management.Early in the book, Jamie Lynn writes of being confused by her mom’s insistence on trying to leave their dad, yet still allowing him to make decisions for her daughters. But she sees the conservatorship as a good thing because it was a way to help rehabilitate her father too.“Seeing my father put Britney’s needs ahead of his own desires helped my old resentments fade,” she writes. “This was the first time in my life where someone was holding them accountable for their behaviors, and the perpetual anxiety I lived with for so long finally subsided. I could stop worrying about their sobriety.”It’s as if both daughters can’t get out of the gendered family patterns they’ve internalized to see each other as a whole. Britney “adored having the role of caregiver,” Jamie Lynn writes, seemingly not wondering, even in retrospect, whether Britney ever resented being placed in that position. And whether that’s part of her anger now.“I know it's not your fault and I'm sorry for being so angry at you,” Britney writes to her sister in a text included in the book, seemingly referring to her conservatorship abuse. “Although I'm your big sister, I need you more than you need me and always have.” Both have been failed by the mixing of business with familial self-sacrifice that always seems to leave young women in entertainment specifically vulnerable to exploitation.Britney has been speaking out about her sister on Twitter and Instagram, with both petty and more deeply vulnerable accusations. “You say you love me,” she wrote in one post, “yet your loyalty is still with the people that hurt me the most.” She also implied that she’s now working on her own book. “Shall I start from the beginning?” she wrote. It sounds like she’s already working on the next chapter. ●

23,The new requirements come after allegations of drugging and sexual assault at fraternity houses prompted protest.,"


After a series of suspensions over allegations of drugging and sexual assault, fraternities at the University of Southern California can start hosting parties again in March — if they hire security guards to keep people out of bedrooms.The new, unprecedented policy was announced this week after protests and calls to reform or abolish Greek life on campus last fall prompted the Interfraternity Council to halt all fraternity house events. In October, USC's Sigma Nu chapter was suspended after six students said they were drugged at a party and one student said they were sexually assaulted. Three additional fraternities were placed on interim suspensions and another on a ""modified suspension"" while it underwent an investigation by the university's Office for Equity, Equal Opportunity and Title IX. Advertisement     Last week, just before in-person classes were expected to resume and Greek organizations were expected to start recruiting new members, the university notified them what requirements they will have to meet in order to resume social events in the spring. A working group of fraternity members, student government, faculty, and safety officials drafted the new guidelines during the winter break, according to a statement from USC Provost Charles F. Zukoski.""About 4,000 of our students participate in fraternity and sorority life at USC, and many say that this is a central part of their USC experience,"" Zukoski wrote in a letter to students. ""Developing and strengthening this partnership will be critical to our long term success in meeting our goals.""Fraternities and sororities were already required to hire security guards at the doors of their parties, but the new guidelines will also require them to hire security ""at stairs or hallways leading to bedrooms.""The security will have to be reviewed by the university.
 


All fraternity members will also be required to complete prevention workshops, and if any member doesn't participate, they won't be allowed to host parties at all.The four chapters that remain under suspension will still not be allowed to host parties or recruit until the investigation into the allegations is complete, Zukoski wrote in the letter.In October 2021, USC President Carol Folt acknowledged that the university had acted with ""troubling delay"" after it had received multiple confidential reports about students allegedly being drugged and one sexually assaulted at a fraternity, the Los Angeles Times reported.The school did not share the information broadly until a month after the allegations were made, when a report of a sexual assault at the Sigma Nu fraternity house was posted by the Department of Public Safety.""Our community must work together to end sexual assault on our campuses,"" Zukoski wrote. ""We appreciate everyone who brings forward concerns and reports sexual assault and issues impacting safety and well-being, and we understand how difficult this can be.""

24,"Will a light alarm clock actually help you rise and shine? Here’s what products to look for and how to use them to go to sleep and wake up more easily, according to experts.","

Just so you know, BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them. Oh, and FYI — prices are accurate and items in stock as of the time of publication.Is there a sound that makes you shudder because it reminds you of being jolted out of a deep sleep on countless cold, dark mornings? I have two: the infamous grating beep of OG alarm clocks and that first-ever default iPhone alarm sound that berated me into waking up for 9 a.m. classes in college. Thankfully, there is now a gentler solution: a sunrise alarm clock. Advertisement     These days, we tend to use our phones for everything, which can be hugely convenient. If your handy smartphone provides a certain function, it can be a hard sell to invest in a separate product that serves the same purpose and takes up more space.But if you’re a troubled sleeper or find it difficult to rise and shine, especially before sunrise, a light or sunrise alarm clock may be well worth the buy.What are sunrise alarm clocks?“The key thing that these alarm clocks try to mimic is direct sunlight exposure,” said Rebecca Robbins, an associate scientist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and instructor at Harvard Medical School. “They build on the circadian science that light is a vital input to our internal circadian rhythm.”The part of our brain that guides our circadian rhythm, Robbins explained, is housed behind the eyeballs, making our eyes the receptors of light that kick-starts the awake phase of this 24-hour cycle.That’s why exposing yourself to light in the morning, even if it’s only a simulation of the sun, will help trigger that alertness by suppressing the flow of the hormone melatonin from the pineal gland in the brain. (Darkness triggers melatonin release, while light can halt its production.) Advertisement     These clocks can be especially helpful in certain regions of the world, at times of the year when hours of sunlight vary, or any time you need to artificially replicate sunrise and sunset to signal a proper sleep schedule. Your circadian rhythms can also respond to decreasing light at the end of the day, according to Dr. Raj Dasgupta of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. That means that a dimming function is another helpful component to have in a sunrise alarm clock because it can help you wind down for bedtime.Which sunrise alarm clock is best?When searching for the best sunrise alarm clock for you, the sunset option is key if, regardless of the season, you tend to have issues falling asleep as well as waking up. Robbins adds that warmer colors of light are a soothing effect for bedtime while cool, bright blue tones emulate sunshine for an alerting effect in the morning, so the availability of those varying shades is key. Though many of us tend to depend on a snooze button, the lack of one could actually be helpful if you’re looking to establish healthier sleep habits.“With your first alarm, you’ve extracted likely from your best, most restorative stages of sleep,” she said. “The only sleep you’re getting after interrupting those really deep, rich stages is twilight sleep, which is the worst thing we can do.” (Twilight is stage 1 of non-REM sleep, which is a lighter stage where you can still have some awareness of what's happening around you.)For those who go with a snooze option, Dr. Dasgupta advises keeping the alarm clock out of arm’s reach so that you have to get up to turn it off, which will encourage you to get out of bed instead of further delaying the start of your day. Since sleep preferences in general are quite individualized, he suggests looking for an alarm clock with adjustable features so that you can customize brightness and sound elements to your needs.Do sunrise alarm clocks work?Experts agree that while a wake-up light alone may not give you more restful nights, they can be helpful when used in conjunction with good sleep hygiene, which includes sleeping in a cool, dark room; using your bed only for sleeping (stimulus control); and sticking to set bedtimes and wake times. Advertisement     Shelby Harris, a clinical psychologist specializing in behavioral sleep medicine, also notes that if you tend to bury your head under the covers or can’t resist repeated snooze sessions, this type of alarm clock may not be the right choice. It all depends on your ideal sleep environment and where your sleeping or waking issues are stemming from.Sunrise alarm clocks and seasonal affective disorderIf you tend to struggle to get out of bed when you’re forced to wake up in complete darkness on winter mornings and you experience season-related mood changes in general, you may have seasonal affective disorder.While anyone can have the “winter blues,” about 5% of people have seasonal affective disorder, otherwise known as SAD or seasonal depression, according to the American Psychiatric Association.SAD is a type of depression that’s most common in fall and winter months, when there are fewer hours of sunlight per day, although it can occur in summer in some people. People who have SAD experience symptoms for about 40% of the year, and it’s more common in women than men.One common treatment is light therapy, which often comes in the form of a specific type of lamp.“Light has a physiological direct impact on our mood,” which is why light therapy helps with seasonal depression, Robbins explained.Since many of these sunrise alarm clocks have adjustable brightness settings, it makes sense that they could also help with some symptoms of SAD.That said, light therapy for SAD treatment usually involves 20 to 30 minutes of direct exposure to a lightbox with a brightness of 10,000 lux each morning or a lightbox with a brightness of 2,500 lux for one to two hours.Sunrise alarm clocks tend to have a lux that’s 300 or lower. While gradual light from an alarm clock might help improve your mood and ability to wake up, follow your healthcare provider’s guidance for any light-related treatments if you’ve been diagnosed with SAD.Sunrise alarm clocks and insomniaWhen Dr. Dasgupta thinks about alarm clocks or any other device that’s supposed to help you get good sleep, he thinks of one patient population in particular — those with insomnia. While almost everyone experiences an inability to sleep at some point, he’s referring to those with chronic insomnia, which the American Academy of Sleep Medicine defines as having symptoms more than three times per week for up to three months. Advertisement     Insomnia generally involves difficulty initiating sleep and maintaining sleep throughout the night. While he emphasizes that the mainstay therapy for these issues is cognitive behavioral therapy, sunrise alarm clocks are among the sleep products that may help.“You have to have all the right pieces to complete that puzzle to get that good sleep,” he said. “When people try different things to get good sleep, it really depends on what puzzle piece is missing.”For some, that missing piece may be the comfort of a weighted blanket. For others, a white noise machine may do the trick. But if you’re sensitive to light and creating faux dawn sounds like a nicer way to wake than jarring beeps and jingles, it’s well worth trying out one of the clocks on this list.
 


Hatch Restore
 


Hatch may be the biggest name in sunrise alarm clocks, and for good reason. Though the Hatch Restore comes at a higher price point than some other options, it’s also one of the more aesthetically pleasing, customizable, and multifunctional light-up clocks to keep by your bed. Harris, who wrote The Women’s Guide to Overcoming Insomnia, personally likes a clock that has a white noise component, allows you to choose the intensity of light, and can be set using your phone. The Hatch Restore satisfies those requirements and lets you fully personalize your sleep-to-wake routine with a variety of lights and sounds, all of which can be controlled in the app or with soft-touch buttons on the device.Promising review: “Loved the simple design. So many features rolled into one. Looks great. Helped me sleep so much better on the very first night. The sunrise alarm is such a peaceful way to wake up and the sounds included are exactly what I was looking for.” —Amazon customerWhat else to consider: This clock doesn’t have a snooze button and is quite reliant on the app to control, meaning a reliable Wi-Fi connection is a must. It also must be plugged in to use, so it’s best if you plan on keeping it by your bed, and it doesn’t have a USB port for phone charging.Best for: people who care about design and are willing to invest a bit more in their sleep hygiene. It’s also great for those trying to break free of the snooze button and anyone who enjoys a wide variety of white noise in their alarm clock.You can get the Hatch Restore at Amazon for around $130.
 


Philips SmartSleep Wake-Up Light
 


Another great option for a little bit less is this Philips Wake-Up Light. It helps you wake up easily and with more energy and can improve your morning mood, according to the company. There are 20 light intensities to personalize the brightness, five natural sounds, and sunset as well as sunrise simulations to prepare your body for waking or sleeping by gradually changing the light levels. It does have a tap-to-snooze feature if that’s important to you, though the experts advise against snoozing.Promising review: “I live in Minneapolis where it gets dark very early in the winter and is usually dark when I wake up for work. After the time change this year, I noticed that my depression and willingness to get out of bed went out the door. While I manage my SAD and depression very well, I had heard of these types of lamps and got this one as it was recommended by a friend. I’m not kidding - I have felt better every morning when I wake up because of it. It very gently starts the ‘sunrise’ effect so that you may notice it gently which simulates the summer sunrise. I did start using the beach noise option but my cats thought there were seagulls in my bedroom (lol) so now I use the radio and the volume of the radio gradually increases with the light. The other nature sounds are also very tame and not obnoxious. My overall mood has increased ten-fold.” —Courtney H.What else to consider: Some customers note that the controls can be difficult and that it can be hard to find the button you’re looking for, especially when you’re trying to turn off the alarm. The brightness levels are not drastically different, so if you want something that will dim to complete darkness, it may not be the one for you.Best for: those who appreciate seriously bright light in an orb shape that somewhat resembles the sun and has an aesthetically pleasing design.You can get the Philips SmartSleep Wake-Up Light at Amazon for around $100.
 


Jall Wake-Up Light
 


Similar to the Philips version but even more affordable, this wake-up light gets rave reviews. Not only is the brightness adjustable, but you can also choose from seven different colors, ranging from cool to warm. The sunrise simulation setting increases from 10% to 100% over your chosen time period (anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes) and can be accompanied by one of the seven natural sound options. There’s also a snooze button and a reading light setting in case you like to wind down at night with a good book.Promising review: “I spent a couple weeks looking at different sunrise simulation alarm clocks before deciding to purchase this one and I am so glad I did. The instructions were detailed and very easy to follow, the clock itself has a ton of features (max brightness, alarm sound, alarm volume, time it takes to get to full brightness, different colors, night mode, snooze), and it has worked perfectly since I have received it. It has made waking up so much nicer as I am one to easily oversleep and wake up upset to my loud alarms. I’ve been telling my friends and family about it - 10/10 recommend.” —KimWhat else to consider: Reviewers appreciated that you can completely turn off the alarm digits and display, though some had a hard time setting the FM radio function and dealing with the physical controls, similar to the button design on the Philips SmartSleep.Best for: anyone who needs absolute darkness to fall asleep and/or wants to try out a quality sunrise alarm clock at a lower price point.You can get the Jall Wake-Up Light at Amazon for around $50.
 


Casper Glow Light
 


You may know Casper for its mattresses, but the company has now expanded into the whole universe of sleep products, including this glow light. You can use it with or without the Casper Glow app, which allows you to set your sleep and wake times and customize several other settings on your phone. It lulls you to sleep with a slowly dimming warm light and gently wakes you with soft light in the morning. You can flip it to turn the light on and off, twist it to adjust the brightness, and wiggle it if you need a low glow to guide you to the bathroom. That’s right — it sits on a wireless charging station, and you can pick it up and use it as a portable lantern to navigate your home at night. If you’re looking for something wireless and sleek without too many bells and whistles, this may be the sunrise alarm clock for you.Promising review: “My Glow lights have literally changed my life. I’m a night shift nurse. The time change is always a struggle because I feel like I never see the sun. I’m constantly sleepy and fatigued. It’s so hard for me to wake up in the evening/late afternoon when my room is so dark. Enter Glow. The gentle wake-up timer is so nice. It gives my body a nudge to start waking up without being jolted by an alarm. And because my room slowly gets brighter I don’t have that inclination to just hit snooze and go back to sleep! I am super satisfied with these little guys. They are also just nice lights for when I’m chilling on my nights off and I’m up late. 10/10 would recommend.” —EricaWhat else to consider: Though customers rave about the gentleness of the sleep and wake settings, that also means the light never gets super bright and there aren’t any sound settings, so it may not be the best choice if you’re a very heavy sleeper or want to wake up to chirping birds. There’s also no clock on the device, so you’d need to rely on your phone or another device.Best for: someone who values a warm and gentle glow to ease into and out of restful sleep, could use a light that’s portable and easy to use, and doesn’t need an actual clock.You can get the Casper Glow Light at Casper for around $130.

25,The race offers Democrats a high-profile test at how forcefully they should counter conspiracy theories promoted by candidates like Johnson.,"


Democrats in Wisconsin think they have the perfect chance to take out one of Donald Trump’s closest allies in the Senate. But to do it, they’ll have to find a candidate who can balance knocking back a conspiracy theorist without alienating voters in an intensely polarized state.Four Democrats are considered the candidates most likely to win the nomination and go up against Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who announced he would run for reelection this month despite his long-held promise to only serve two terms. Democrats see him as more vulnerable than other Republicans in an election cycle broadly viewed as favorable to the GOP. Advertisement     The state, which President Joe Biden won in 2020 after it went to Donald Trump in 2016, offers a spread of the dynamics happening on the national level: extreme polarization, a Trumpian foil for Democrats, and a competitive electorate exhausted by the pandemic. The August primary offers Democrats one of their first high-profile tests of just how forcefully they should counter conspiracy theories around the election and COVID-19 that have quickly spread among Trump’s base and that have been mirrored by a number of politicians who’ve received endorsements from the former president.“Wisconsin has a lot of kind of microcosms of national dynamics. There’s a pretty deep partisan division here, but also a very pragmatic streak,” state party Chair Ben Wikler told BuzzFeed News. “Making the case that you’re running as sort of an outcast and being a kind of a practical problem solver is a winning formula in Wisconsin.”Democrats are banking on Johnson no longer being able to make that case. Early messaging from the left is that Johnson, a onetime political pariah who unexpectedly beat out a longtime establishment Democrat and then held him off in his next election, has become deeply entrenched in Washington politics. An ad released by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Senate Democrats’ campaign arm, accuses Johnson of looking out for himself and his megadonors rather than his constituents.But there are additional arguments to be made against him, including his rampant use of conspiracy theories.Here are just a few examples: In late 2020, Johnson, as chair of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, held a hearing that invited witnesses who approached the COVID-19 pandemic in an unscientific way and spread misinformation. After the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, he also falsely claimed that “provocateurs” caused the violence at the Capitol rather than Trump supporters. It’s been a long but not lonely arch for Johnson, from the tea party breakthrough candidate who had never held political office prior to a far-right and high-profile conspiracy theorist during Trump’s presidency. Months before Johnson announced he would run for reelection, he received an endorsement from former president Donald Trump, who encouraged him to go for it: “Run, Ron, Run!” Advertisement     Still months out from the August primary, Democratic candidates are making themselves known to the electorate. The top tier is made up of state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, the Milwaukee Bucks’ senior vice president Alex Lasry, and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson.“I think it is pretty early for them to be trying to distinguish themselves [from each other], and I do think that Democrats in the state of Wisconsin would like to defeat Ron Johnson,” Lilly Goren, a professor of political science at Carroll University in Waukesha, told BuzzFeed News. “They’re maybe not necessarily flinging mud at each other, so much as trying to — even at this point before the primary is over — be sort of attacking Johnson.”Two of the candidates — Godlewski, a former defense contractor, and Barnes, the first Black lieutenant governor in the state and a former state assemblymember — have previously won statewide races for their current positions. Lasry, whose résumé is speckled with past involvement in politics including advising in the Obama administration, is running as a progressive businessperson. And Nelson touts serving as a Bernie Sanders delegate in the 2020 Democratic National Convention.Several national figures have already weighed in on the primary: Barnes has notched endorsements that include Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, as well as House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn. A November poll of Wisconsin likely voters conducted by the progressive think tank Data for Progress showed Barnes leading over the closest competitor by 23 points. (Although 29% of those surveyed also said they weren’t sure who they would vote for if the primary were held the next day.) The Barnes campaign also released an internal poll at the start of the year showing a similar advantage.On the national level, Democrats are looking to make heavy investments in Wisconsin. The DSCC has not made an endorsement (an aide at the DSCC said that they are assessing challenger campaigns and have not made endorsements in any of them), but already made an ad buy pegged around Johnson’s announcement that he would run. The state is also part of the DSCC’s “Defend the Majority” program, a $30 million investment targeting nine states and aimed at ground field organizing, which the DSCC has boasted as the biggest investment of its kind made this early in a campaign cycle. Advertisement     It will not be easy for whoever ends up the Democratic nominee. The Cook Political Report has the race listed as a toss-up, and it will undoubtedly be an expensive and exhausting one. But neither party will want to leave anything to chance: According to statewide race data compiled by Joe Zepecki, a Democratic consultant in the state, 4 of the last 11 statewide races with more than one candidate have been within 30,000 votes, including the presidential race between Biden and Trump.“There are benefits to polarization,” Zepecki told BuzzFeed News. “Both sides have gotten so good at knowing where their base is and how to turn them out, and [that’s] why you see so many close elections.”Democrats have had a good recent streak in getting their candidates elected to statewide office. Currently, Tony Evers, who is up for reelection this year, holds the governor’s office, and Tammy Baldwin, reelected in 2018, has the state’s other Senate seat. Prior to Johnson, a Republican hadn’t held a Senate seat in the state since 1993.But they don’t need to look any further than Johnson’s presence in the Senate, Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton, and Scott Walker defeating his recall election in 2012 for evidence of the strong Republican presence.“I think this could easily swing to the Democrats. I think Ron Johnson will also be a tough opponent,” Ben Nuckels, a Democratic consultant in Wisconsin, told BuzzFeed News. “The US Senate race is going to be very close, and the reason Democrats want Ron Johnson as the GOP nominee is because he is far easier to beat than some of the other candidates who were considering running.“The national trends could dramatically affect the race here.”

26,House members pushed back on crypto CEOs’ assertion that Bitcoin’s energy consumption is actually a “feature not a bug.”,"


For years, cryptocurrency has rivaled entire nations in terms of energy use, and US lawmakers are just now starting to investigate how crypto mining operations could be undermining global efforts to combat climate change.This question was the subject of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing on Thursday that broadly examined the carbon footprint of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum. The panel addressed a growing refrain that certain types of crypto transactions are catastrophically energy intensive and are extending the lifetime of fossil fuel resources. Committee members also questioned some of the promises made by crypto boosters, such as the claim that miners can actually help stabilize energy grids. Advertisement     “Our focus now needs to be reducing carbon emissions overall, and increasing the share of green energy on the grid,” subcommittee Chair Rep. Diana DeGette said during introductory remarks. While the unique demands of crypto “present potential benefits,” DeGette continued, “it’s important to understand the degree to which this is actually being done.”The hearing marks one of the few times that lawmakers have discussed crypto’s climate implications on a bipartisan stage. Last year, six crypto company executives testified before the House Financial Services Committee; one of those CEOs, Bitfury’s Brian Brooks, appeared again on Thursday as a panel witness alongside other crypto CEOs and former government officials.“Crypto’s energy consumption is a feature, not a bug,” said witness John Belizaire, CEO of data center developer Soluna Computing, claiming that “the narrative of [crypto’s] threat to the grid is wrong.”The crypto CEOs on the panel unanimously testified that mining operations can incentivize the production of clean, renewable energy. This approach is currently playing out in Texas, where crypto businesses, with the blessing of Sen. Ted Cruz, are flooding the state’s power grid in exchange for renewable energy support. As part of these deals, crypto operations have been agreeing to voluntarily power down when energy demands are at their highest. Advertisement     But whether that approach is sustainable or even realistic is up for question. Witness Steve Wright, former CEO of a consumer-owned power utility in Chelan County, Washington, encountered similar promises in 2014 when crypto miners flocked to the area due to low electricity rates and the availability of high-speed internet. While the “ability to modulate usage would be valuable,” Wright said, “Chelan did not receive serious modulation offers — maybe because of the desire to run [operations] continuously due to the short lifetime of mining machines.”Committee members stressed concerns that despite these possibilities, miners are still incentivized to use cheap, dirty energy over sustainable power, noting the recent example of bitcoin miners resuscitating coal power plants in Venango County, Pennsylvania.For years, researchers studying the environmental effects of cryptocurrency have warned of its ability to accelerate ecological decline. Scientists writing for the publication Nature theorized that continued bitcoin usage, if mirroring the growth rates of other broadly adopted technologies, could produce enough emissions to raise global temperatures by 2 degrees Celsius within the next two decades. (The goal of the Paris Accords is to limit global warming to well below 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial levels.)“To achieve these [climate] goals we cannot bring retired fossil fuel plants back online in support of [energy intensive crypto mining],” said Rep. Frank Pallone, chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.At the core of regulatory concerns are “proof of work” (PoW) algorithms used by currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum to mine new tokens and validate transactions. Because PoW involves miners competing to correctly solve a mathematical puzzle in exchange for newly minted coins, it can demand huge amounts of computing power. “This system is inherently inefficient,” said Claudia Herbert, a PhD candidate at the University of California, Berkeley who studies carbon markets and the emerging overlap with cryptocurrency projects.According to Digiconomist, a digital trends platform that maintains a Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, bitcoin consumes 204.50 terawatt-hours of electricity annually, comparable to the power consumption of Thailand, and boasts a carbon footprint equaling that of Kuwait. Much of that energy use is concentrated in the US, which accounted for roughly 35% of the world’s bitcoin mining last year — the highest share for any single country, according to Cambridge University. Digiconomist’s consumption index for ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency behind bitcoin, estimates that its electrical usage is equal to that of the Netherlands, and that its carbon footprint is roughly the size of Sweden. Advertisement     PoW “needs to be intensely regulated,” said Zane Griffin Talley Cooper, a doctoral candidate at the University of Pennsylvania who has researched the energy costs of crypto in places like Iceland and Greenland.Alternatively, the committee’s memo cited “proof of stake” (PoS) algorithms as evidence that some mechanisms “can provide secure, trusted transaction infrastructure without the same energy intensity as popular [proof of work] blockchains.” By comparison, PoS demands fewer computing resources by selecting who gets to validate a transaction based on the amount of crypto they’ve put up as collateral. Ethereum has said it will transition to PoS this year, noting its “better energy efficiency.”While the US contemplates how to lower crypto’s energy consumption, other countries are actively focusing on reining in mining, in part due to environmental and energy concerns. In 2021, China enacted a ban on all bitcoin transactions after having mined two-thirds of the world’s bitcoins the year prior. Neighboring countries like Kazakhstan saw the cascading effects of China’s crackdown as mining operations flooded their borders and energy grid, taking advantage of empty warehouses and low electricity costs. Swedish regulators are now calling for a ban on PoW mining throughout the European Union.At the hearing, no committee member suggested a similar ban. Some instead hinted at potential solutions like legislation requiring crypto companies to use a certain mix of renewable fuels, but members mostly emphasized their desire to make space for blockchain technologies while also prioritizing US climate goals or energy interests.“While the industry has matured and there are now responsible actors in this space, we should be ready to collaborate and encourage innovation and investment in cleaner renewable energy,” Pallone said.

27,“I’m too short to see anyone’s yarmulkes.”,"


Rep. Lauren Boebert left a group of Jewish visitors to the Capitol bewildered Thursday morning when she asked them if they were doing ""reconnaissance"" after seeing them at an elevator at the Capitol.Members of the group, which was meeting with Rep. Tom Suozzi, were wearing yarmulkes, and the person coordinating the group is Orthodox, with a traditional beard.One witness said the group, along with other members of Congress, was waiting for an elevator. When the doors opened, Boebert stepped out of the elevator and looked the group of visitors “from head to toe,” the witness said. Boebert then asked if they were there to conduct “reconnaissance.” Advertisement     “When I heard that, I actually turned to the person standing next to me and asked, ‘Did you just hear that?’” a rabbi who was with the group told BuzzFeed News.“You know, I’m not sure to be offended or not,” the rabbi said. “I was very confused.” The rabbi added that “people are very sensitive” now, especially after what happened in Texas this past weekend, when an armed man held four people hostage at a synagogue.Boebert told BuzzFeed News that she was referencing the many comments that have been directed at her from Democrats about Capitol tours prior to the Jan. 6 attack, adding that some people present “got it.”“I saw a large group and made a joke. Sadly when Democrats see the same they demonize my family for a year straight,” she said in a text.“I’m too short to see anyone’s yarmulkes,” she added.Suozzi brought the group to the US Capitol to commemorate the 41st anniversary of the end of the Iran hostage crisis. Members of the group have been backing Suozzi’s efforts to recognize the hostages with a Congressional Gold Medal.""The bottom line is that everyone, especially members of Congress, have to be very, very thoughtful in the language they use,” Suozzi said in a statement about the incident. “Because when you're a member of Congress, you have an important role to play in society. You can't be cavalier in the comments you make especially if they could be perceived as being antisemitic, or discriminatory.""Boebert has repeatedly come under criticism from Democrats and others for her comments in the year she’s been in office. In November, anti-Muslim remarks she directed at Rep. Ilhan Omar led to a flurry of debate among House Democrats over whether or not to formally reprimand her.She has, at the same time, grown in influence in the right wing of her party. Boebert was tapped as the communications chair of the House Freedom Caucus. In her announcement, she said she’ll “work diligently to make sure the caucus’s message, and the powerful messages of each member, are delivered to the American people.”

29,"Current fighting between Ukraine and Russia has been more frequent and intense than previously known. Here’s how soldiers are avoiding sniper fire, digging trenches, and preparing for war.","


NIU-YORK, Ukraine — In this little town in eastern Ukraine, where residents on the front line of Russia’s eight-year-long war never sleep a sound night, it was soldier Ihor Tychyna’s turn to keep watch.It was just after 2 a.m. on Dec. 27, and light snow was falling. The lanky 20-year-old of the 95th Air Assault Brigade was stomping through the neck-deep maze of trenches when he reached a shallower segment of the channel. With the mud squishing beneath his feet, he almost certainly didn’t hear the quiet chirp of a sniper’s bullet, fired from a bluff 800 meters away before it penetrated the left side of his head just 1 inch below his helmet. Advertisement  “It was a Mission Impossible kind of shot,” Denis Ivashchenko, a 21-year-old officer to whom Tychyna reported, told me this week when I visited his brigade’s positions. “It was dark and snowing, and he was moving. The sniper had to be a professional.”Ivashchenko found Tychyna moments later, slumped over. There was a hole in his skull and blood was pooling beneath him in the fresh snow. Tychyna was rushed to a nearby hospital but died New Year’s Day, the first Ukrainian soldier to do so in 2022. He’s now one of the roughly 14,000 people killed since the war started in spring 2014.Three weeks later, Andriy, a 21-year-old soldier with a carefully trimmed beard, was digging with a pickax and shovel at the spot in the trench where Tychyna was shot.“It should be deep,” Ivashchenko said, monitoring Andriy’s work.Andriy shoveled dirt and tossed it over his shoulder. Now, the top of his helmet was nearly a foot below ground level. Advertisement  
 


This is what the war in eastern Ukraine, a region known locally as the Donbas, has been like since an uneasy stalemate took hold in winter 2015, following nearly a year of all-out war. It is grinding, bloody, and senseless. Nobody here has been on the offensive for years. Most battlefield deaths lately have been from sniper fire and landmines. A handful of soldiers die every month. But danger still lurks around every trench corner. Soldiers here know to never let their guard down. But after eight years of this, sometimes they do.It is Ukraine’s forever war, where generations have fought and come of age. Fathers who first took up arms in 2014 now have sons like Andriy, Denis, and Ihor who were teenagers when Moscow annexed Crimea and invaded the Donbas eight years ago. (Andriy, who comes from a military family, said his father fought in Debaltseve, a 2015 battle that saw the Ukrainian military encircled and pounded by heavy artillery and that turned the tide of the war in Russia’s favor. Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers died in what was one of the biggest single-battle losses for Kyiv. Andriy’s father was lucky to escape.) Today, these young men are the first line of Ukraine’s defense at the front.I spent a week embedded with Ukraine’s military in three strategic positions along the 250-mile front line — in Niu-York, Avdiivka, and Opytne — to find out what they have seen and how they are preparing for an attack. I found that the fighting in the Donbas has been more frequent and intense than has been reported by both sides, with daily skirmishes using small arms, sniper duels, and provocations with smaller mortar systems. Soldiers in three different positions all noted the return of heavy artillery to Russia-backed positions. In some locations, fresh trenches are being dug.
 


The United States and its NATO allies warn that they may soon face the full force of the Russian military and renewed fighting likely on a scale greater than what’s been seen so far, as the Kremlin gears up for what appears to be a new invasion of Ukraine.“My guess is he will move in, he has to do something,” President Joe Biden said about Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. A full-scale invasion of Ukraine would be “the most consequential thing that’s happened in the world in terms of war and peace since World War II,” Biden added, with the risk of it spreading beyond the Ukrainian borders where it “could get out of hand.”For weeks, Russia massed more than 127,000 troops and tons of military equipment along Ukraine’s border, a Ukrainian intelligence official told me Wednesday, ratcheted up its rhetoric and disinformation campaigns against Kyiv, and allegedly hit government agencies with cyberattacks. Satellite images and posts on social media have tracked the buildup in almost real time.“Ukraine does not want a war, but Ukraine must always be ready for it,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday in a televised address during which he urged Ukrainians to remain calm. “We are not afraid because we protect our land. We will not give up because there is nowhere to run.” Advertisement  For its part, the Kremlin has denied any plan to invade Ukraine anew, saying that what it does with its military forces on its own territory is its business. But it has also delivered a list of demands to the US and NATO that it said must be met or else it will respond militarily against Ukraine. Diplomacy has so far failed to de-escalate the situation. Almost nobody believes that Moscow wants to find a peaceful solution.And so Ukraine is bracing for what could be a devastating new war.
 


Many soldiers said that Russia’s latest military moves make them nervous; there’s palpable anxiety mounting on the front. But Ukraine’s troops have been preparing for this moment for several years.“We’re not scared. We’ve had time to grow stronger. We’re real soldiers now,” 24-year-old Platoon Commander Valentin Trusov told me in the village of Opytne, where just about 28 residents remain, living without electricity and heating.I reached him from a desolate road where it’s necessary to race at high speed in order to avoid fire. In peacetime, this drive would be an idyllic one, with golden fields of sunflowers and tall grass lining the highway. Now soldiers here refer to it as a “road of life” as it offers an escape from danger. But sometimes it’s also the “road of death.” Two troops were killed by an anti-armor missile on it last summer while on a supply run.
 


Shortly after I arrived, a small volley of grenades fired from an automatic grenade launcher came in. Trusov told me to keep my head down as we toured his unit’s forward-most positions. The destroyed Donetsk Airport, once a glimmering symbol of progress in the rough-and-tumble coal mining region, was just 600 meters away. Through a scope, I could make out craters on the runway left from fighting more than seven years ago.“They fire on us all the time. Every day,” he said, contradicting reports in recent days that there have been no violations of a ceasefire that has existed in name since February 2015.Trusov said that lately his troops have increasingly been targeted with 82mm and 122mm artillery. Pointing southeast toward the airport, which Russian proxy forces hold, he said enemy battle tanks were positioned behind a tree line.The Ukrainian military is indeed significantly stronger and much larger than it was in 2014, when Russian forces seized the Crimean peninsula without a fight and then used special forces and separatist proxies to take over a swath of the Donbas roughly the size of New Jersey. Today, with more than 200,000 active-duty troops, Ukraine’s army is among the largest in Europe. Western weapons deliveries and NATO training have also helped to modernize Ukraine’s military. Advertisement  But it’s still dwarfed and outmatched by Russia. Should Putin launch an all-out offensive with the estimated 100 battalion tactical groups, including soldiers from his ground forces, airborne brigades, and the marines positioned nearby, there is little that Ukrainian forces could do to stop them.Nevertheless, Ukrainians say they are willing to try and even to die to ensure the survival of their country.Amid the ruins of a former tire factory on the outskirts of Avdiivka, I linked up with the 25th Airborne Brigade and First Lt. Ivan Skuratovsky, a 30-year-old married father of two. After an unsuccessful hunt for an engineering job, he had the unfortunate luck of joining the army just months before the war broke out.As a 22-year-old in 2014, Skuratovsky fought in some of the fiercest battles as a gunner on a Ukrainian version of the US Bradley Fighting Vehicle. He survived, but his unit lost seven soldiers and the battalion another 25 between August and November that year. Now he’s one of the most senior people in the brigade. Advertisement  The 25th has been positioned in Avdiivka since August. Known as the Promzona, the area has been the site of some of the most intense fighting over the years. Almost everything here is pockmarked from artillery shells, shrapnel, and machine-gun fire. It’s a Mad Max–like scene with the burned husks of cars and machinery littered across the grounds. Feral dogs roam the wreckage, and other than their growls and the whipping winds, the only sounds you hear between the sporadic cracks of gunfire and thuds of mortars is the eerie creak of sheet metal.
 


I followed soldiers here through a maze of trenches and found Oleh, a 43-year-old commander, fiddling with his machine gun as I approached his dugout. A sign at its entrance read, “Hell is empty. All the devils are here.” Dressed in snow-white camouflage, he pointed through a small wooden cutout to where his enemy stands just 50 meters away. Through a scope, he can sometimes see their breath rise above their open trenches. It’s so close that he can also hear the clanking of weapons and conversations being had by the very people who are trying to kill him.“We can hear them prepare their provocations,” he said. Russia-backed fighters often take potshots at the Ukrainian soldiers in hopes of getting them to return fire and, as Oleh put it, “pick a fight.”He can also hear them “curse and complain” when they’re given orders to dig new trenches or carry out other commands, giving the impression that morale among the local Russia-backed forces is low.I’ve seen evidence of that in photos provided by a source and on social media accounts of those still living in the occupied city of Donetsk: advertisements offer monthly payments of around $300 for new recruits to join the “Armed Forces of the Donetsk People’s Republic” — which is essentially an arm of Russia’s military. Composed mainly of local Ukrainians who chose Moscow’s side, they have been used as cannon fodder in key battles, sustaining most of the casualties, while Russia’s regular forces are used sparingly, often when their proxies are losing a fight in order to turn it around.Lately, however, there has been an uptick in sniper fire, as well as an increase in reconnaissance and sabotage.
 


“At this moment, snipers fire and machine guns cover his position” by masking the sound of the shot, Skuratovsky told me.On Dec. 31, three hours before midnight, Junior Sgt. Stanislav Bohuslavskiy, 23, was on patrol when he was hit in the head by a sniper’s bullet. “He made a mistake” by letting his guard down for just a moment, Skuratovsky said. “It was a really good sniper. And we think he had thermal vision on his rifle.”Bohuslavskiy, who was remembered by his comrades as a funny guy who was built like a club bouncer, was the last soldier killed in 2021.To Skuratovsky, the manner of his death suggests real professional soldiers may have returned to the front here, possibly in preparation for a new attack. Advertisement  But until that happens, Skuratovsky’s men are unable to freely return fire. For the past several months, they have been under orders to not fire back except in serious circumstances when they’re under direct threat. If it’s just a potshot, they are supposed to let it go. The order, which trickled down from Zelensky to the military’s top brass, is meant to try to keep down the intensity of the fighting here and elsewhere along the front so that Russia cannot find a pretext to attack.The soldiers hate this. When asked about it, they clench their teeth and complain.“It’s hard for our guys to understand,” Skuratovsky said, recognizing the frustration of his soldiers.
 


In September and October, Skuratovsky said, they did meaningfully return fire after being bombarded by “really heavy artillery,” including 122mm shells.Most days, though, they take much more than they give. Lately, it’s been a lot of grenade fire from automatic systems and underbarrel launchers. “They’re like little mortars,” Skuratovsky said. “But they can do a lot of harm.”Inside a bunker made of logs and adorned with children’s drawings sent from across Ukraine to keep up the troops’ morale, Skuratovsky stood among several computers and printers. He complained that he and his soldiers push more paper than they pull triggers at the moment.“We have a joke,” he told me. “A soldier calls on the phone and says, ‘Commander, they are attacking us. Can we return fire?’ And the commander says, ‘Wait, we must file a report first.’” Advertisement     If US and NATO intelligence assessments are right and Russia is about to move into Ukraine anew, the soldiers may very soon have no choice but to fire.Mykhailo, a gravelly voiced 25-year-old commander and father who is expecting his wife to give birth to their second child in the coming weeks, said he’s going to stand his ground no matter what comes at him from across the front line. A religious man who recounted surviving an attack when a hail of bullets all hit a narrow cement column he took cover behind, completely missing him, he wants to ensure that Ukraine will continue to exist for his children.“We will be motivated to fight until the last of our land is liberated,” Mykhailo said, “and not before we can again stand on the borders of all of independent Ukraine.”●Inna Varenytsia contributed reporting.

30,"Out with millennial pink, in with the peri wink","


How much do I love periwinkle? Let me count the ways. Pantone, a color matching company now widely considered to be a fashion industry tastemaker for its color trend forecasts, announced its color of 2022 in early January. Pantone #17-3938, Very Peri, is a purply blue lavender hue, and Pantone predicts that the color will influence what we will buy, what we wear, and what we find appealing before we even know why we're attracted to it.At first, I was sure I'd seen this color only recently — periwinkle and its lighter-colored sibling lavender had taken over my Instagram feed in the last year. The more I started to look for it, the more I saw periwinkle everywhere. Princess Diana was seen in periwinkle more than once, as was Queen Elizabeth, and it has shown up multiple times on the red carpet over the years.In the company’s announcement, Pantone said: ""We are living in transformative times. Very Peri is a symbol of the global zeitgeist of the moment and the transition we are going through."" Advertisement  According to Pantone, the color will help us bridge the gap between technology like the metaverse and other online worlds as it ""illustrates the fusion of modern life and how color trends in the digital world are being manifested in the physical world and vice versa.""We put together some photos of periwinkle (and maybe also some violet) to bring you some inspiration for the coming color year.

31,“Just a friendly reminder that love is NOT pain. That’s a damaging message that allows abuse & toxicity to be misinterpreted for love.”,"Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly have sparked a conversation about the glamorization of pain after revealing an unusual design feature of Megan’s engagement ring. Last week, after months of speculation, Megan and Machine Gun Kelly — whose real name is Colson Baker — announced their engagement on Instagram. “Having walked through hell together, and having laughed more than I ever imagined possible, he asked me to marry him,” Megan wrote. She concluded by announcing that she and Colson celebrated by drinking ""each other’s blood"" — whether or not she was speaking literally remains unclear. Their ~unconventional~ proposal certainly raised eyebrows, but it wasn’t until Colson opened up about the very specific design of Megan’s engagement ring that fans’ shock morphed into concern. If you’ve not seen it, the ring consists of two jewels, corresponding with his and Megan’s respective birthstones, placed on two separate “bands of thorns” which are connected by magnets. Explaining the intricate design to Vogue on Monday, Colson said: “The ring can come apart to make two rings. When it’s together, it’s held in place by a magnet. So you see how it snaps together? And then it forms an obscure heart.” He went on to point out that the “band of thorns” is embedded with sharp spikes, meaning that if Megan were to try to remove the ring, the thorns would dig into her finger and cause pain. “And you see this right here?” he said, seemingly directing the writer’s attention toward the hidden detail. “The bands are actually thorns. So if she tries to take it off, it hurts…” Perhaps with an air of confusion, the writer responded by calling the design feature “very nice,” which prompted Colson to say: “Love is pain.” And while the concept of a painful engagement ring is admittedly very on brand with Megan and Colson’s notoriously dark and grungy romance, it didn’t stop people from questioning the potentially harmful messaging behind the design. In light of the fact that engagement rings originated as a symbol of male ownership, some people suggested that the act of Colson giving Megan a ring that is physically painful to remove seems “possessive and controlling.” Elsewhere on Twitter, writer and producer Kim Caramele honed in on the underlying message behind the design, suggesting that Colson’s “love is pain” reasoning plays into a damaging and complicated narrative that normalizes abusive behaviors in relationships under the guise of intense love. “Just a friendly reminder that love is NOT pain,” she wrote to her followers. “That's a damaging message that allows abuse & toxicity to be misinterpreted for love. Love is wanting each other to be happy & to feel good … Pain is never the barometer. I promise.” Echoing a similar response, another Twitter user accused the couple of “normalizing abuse for attention.” It’s important to discuss the factor of consent here too. Plenty of fans were also quick to point out that given everything we know about their far-from-ordinary relationship, the design sounds like something Megan would likely be on board with. However, many others highlighted that even if the design was entirely consensual, it still isn’t really practical for day-to-day life, nor does it lessen the potentially harmful messaging. “Like, even if you’re into that, this is just impractical,” one reader said. “You need to take your ring(s) off all the time to do basic tasks. Plus I imagine she can’t be wearing it while acting? Like consenting adults can do what they like, but they don’t really need to tell everyone and there should be at least a little thought behind it.” In agreement, another person wrote: “I take my wedding ring off to protect it, like when I wash my hands or work with chemicals. So Megan can’t take it off for basic things like that without being stabbed? How romantic.” However, if you know anything about Megan and Colson, you’ll know that their approach to romance is hardly conventional. Having transcended the limits of simply being “soulmates,” Megan and Colson prefer to identify as “twin flames,” which — according to Megan — is “where a soul has ascended into a high enough level that it can be split into two different bodies at the same time.” If that raised your eyebrows, then you’ll also probably be shocked to hear that last year Colson revealed that he wears a vial of Megan’s blood around his neck. Speaking to Ellen DeGeneres about this at the time, the singer said: “Some people give a handkerchief to their partner. She gave me her DNA.” It was probably this statement that first sparked comparisons between Megan and Colson and Billy Bob Thornton and Angelina Jolie, who were also known for wearing vials containing each other's blood during the early 2000s. Inevitably, the addition of the unusual new ring did little to slow these comparisons, with hundreds of fans online suggesting that Megan and Colson might be taking inspiration from the ~edgy celeb couple~ that walked before them. “This screams Billy Bob & Angelina in the early 2000s,” someone commented on this week's reports. “They're sending off strong Angelina Jolie/Billy Bob Thornton vibes here,” said another. And while Angie and Billy Bob — who divorced in 2003 — seem unfazed by the comparisons, Harry James Thornton, Billy Bob’s son, recently agreed that Megan and Colson might have been inspired by his dad’s past antics. “Ah, they’re copycats!” Harry told Page Six on Thursday, speaking about his dad’s decade-spanning influence. “He’s set trends. I think that’s awesome. I can appreciate that.”"
32,"Pete called himself “a steal” and a “diamond in the trash” amid all the continuous questions around him and Kim Kardashian dating, days after Kanye said he wanted to “beat” him in harsh new lyrics.","It looks like Pete Davidson is making light of the ongoing fuss around his love life — and seemingly hinting at his romance with Kim Kardashian. As you might be aware, Pete has long been faced with people questioning his notorious dating success with some of Hollywood’s biggest names, including Ariana Grande, Kate Beckinsale, and Kaia Gerber, to name a few. Most recently and surprisingly, Pete — who is known for his cutting sense of humor — has been linked with Kim. When Pete and Kim reportedly started dating last November, social media sites were flooded with people questioning the spark between the unlikely couple. In fact, Pete’s ex Kate even subtly chimed in on the conversation back in November, hinting that it’s his “nice personality” that makes him so charming. Well, the Saturday Night Live comedian has now taken it upon himself to answer everyone’s questions about his appeal with a series of jokes made during a stand-up show in New York on Jan. 18. “There seems to be a curiosity about me, is what my friends tell me,” said Pete during his set at the 9th Annual Patrice O’Neal Comedy Benefit Concert. “I was trying to figure out how to explain myself to someone because I was doing an interview,” he said, before comparing himself to a discounted DVD bin full of movies like Shrek Forever and Tropic Thunder. Pete joked that the film Tropic Thunder was a “classic” that “doesn’t belong in the trash” before likening himself to that exact description. “I’m Tropic Thunder,” he said. “I’m the diamond in the trash. It’s a steal.” Pete’s lighthearted quips came after a somewhat rocky week, during which he was faced with a few jabs from Kim’s ex husband, Kanye West. Things got messy last Friday after Kanye — who now legally goes by Ye — said he’d been denied access to Kim’s home to see their children, claiming it was because Pete was inside. “Earlier this week, Monday, when I went to go pick my kids up from school, the security stopped me at the gate. So at that point, security was in between me and my children and that's what was not going to happen,” he told Hollywood Unlocked. “My daughter wanted me to go inside. I was like, I am the richest Black man and North's father, right, and the security was able to stop me from going into the room with my daughter, and that had not been defined,” he said. “I am hearing that the new boyfriend is actually in the house that I can't even go to,” he added. Ye went on to accuse Kim of “playing games” with him before frankly putting her and Pete’s romance on blast. Looking back on Kim and Pete’s joint Saturday Night Live appearance from October — during which they shared a steamy kiss in a sketch — Ye made it very clear that he wasn’t too pleased with the whole thing. “How you gonna bring me to SNL and kiss the dude you dating right in front of me, and everybody’s like, ‘Aw, that’s cool’?” he questioned, referencing the fact that Kim had enlisted his help ahead of her hosting debut. However, Ye’s claim was quickly shut down by Kim’s lawyer, who told Page Six that the rapper isn’t being kept away from his children “by security or anyone else.” Sources close to Pete also refuted the claim, saying that he’s “never been” to Kim’s house. But on top of all that, Ye also called Pete out directly in a new song released just days prior. In his latest hit titled “Eazy,” which features rapper The Game, Ye drops a couple of lines mentioning Pete by name. “God saved me from that crash / Just so I can beat Pete Davidson's ass,” he raps, followed by an unidentified person saying, “Who?” Ye also criticized Kim and her parenting style in the lyrics before referring to himself as a “noncustodial dad.” But despite the huge stir caused by Ye’s lyrics, Pete simply laughed the whole thing off during an episode of SNL that aired shortly afterward. Posing as President Joe Biden from a parallel universe, Pete joked that there was only one man better off in our real world. “Everyone on Earth is better off in the real world, except one man named Pete Davidson... Your world is maybe more fun for him,” he quipped. What’s more, just a couple of days ago, sources close to the comedian claimed that he actually finds the dig “totally hilarious.” “Pete thinks it’s totally hilarious,” an insider told Page Six. “Not just that — he thinks the whole [tabloid drama with him, West, and Kardashian] is hilarious. He loves it.” Another source added, “The whole craziness with Kanye last week has brought Kim and Pete closer.”"

34,"Fans were especially outraged after spotting a pair of second-hand Cat and Jack tights being sold by Khloé for $20, despite being available for just $6.99 at Target.","Khloé Kardashian has been criticized by fans after revealing she’s selling her 3-year-old daughter True’s clothes online. As you might be aware, the Kardashian/Jenners have a clothing website known as their “Kloset,” where they each sell a range of secondhand clothing items, some of which have previously been worn by the family themselves. The website claims, “Each authentic item has been hand selected and is now available exclusively for the public to purchase here.” After a bunch of pieces were restocked recently, fans quickly learned that Khloé was offering up a range of her daughter’s clothes. Tweeting out the link to the Kloset on Friday, Khloé wrote, “Omg I miss seeing True in these outfits.” But several users were quick to condemn the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star after realizing that many of the clothes in question are being sold for hundreds of dollars. The most expensive item listed at the moment is a dress by the luxury children’s apparel brand Aristocrat Kids. The secondhand piece was originally being sold by Khloé for $695, though it’s now going for $556. The website also lists a pair of Fendi jeans costing $495. Another pair by the same designer is going for $275. A Givenchy sweater and Balmain skirt were originally priced at $495 each, though these are now both going for half the price in a sale. An Oscar de la Renta dress is also up on the site for $395, while a pair of pink Gucci tennis shoes are listed for $250. In light of the Kardashians being multimillionaires — and the fact that they’re often gifted designer pieces in promotional packages — many fans were shocked to discover the prices listed by Khloé and quickly called the reality star out on Twitter. “Who would pay thar much for children's clothing let alone used,"" one user wrote. ""Who gives a damn about brand names. So disgusted when these clothes could be donated to people I'm need."" “I see why they're Rich... people buy anything and for a ridiculous price,” another added. “The Kardashian/Jenner family resells items of their clothing on their website all the time: Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, Kris, Kendall, and Kylie all have clothes and more from their closets on the website, and in the event, you believed they’d be inexpensive but think again. #greedy,” one person tweeted. But in all the outrage, it was one non-designer item in particular that really got people talking. Several fans pointed out that True’s old Cat and Jack tights were being sold by Khloé for $20, despite going for just $6.99 at Target — and the original price tag can be seen in one of the pictures on the site. “Ummm the cat and Jack tights sell for $6.99 at Target, why are you listing them at $20 ?” one user wrote. “Target brand tights for 20 dollars??? They are 6.99 at the store,” another echoed. “You really deadass reselling some target kids tights for $20 when they $7,” another person said. Some pointed out that the price was listed at $20 due to a shipping rate of $14.95. However, a reader contacted BuzzFeed News to say that when they went to purchase the product, the $14.95 shipping charge was still added on top of the sale price, meaning the original $6.99 leggings cost a total of $34.95 with shipping. As well as calling Khloé out, many fans urged her to donate the clothes to charity — especially given how vocal she's been about the philanthropic work she does behind the scenes in the past. “I cannot believe Khloe K is selling her baby’s clothes bc she’s growing..? She could donate those clothes to the poor or some charity like why would she need a consignment store for a baby??? This is weird,” one user wrote. “It's actually embarrassing to be mega rich and selling your kids clothing for premium prices and no mention of a children's charity or a impoverished family charity,” another tweeted. “I don’t understand reselling the clothes when you clearly don’t need the money and someone else in need could use them,” one person added. On the flip side, however, several users came to Khloé’s defense amid all the backlash. In response to someone who said Khloé should be giving the clothes to charity, one person argued that she shouldn’t be obliged to do anything because of her wealth. “O please! She's done more for charities and people in a month then you probably have. Why shouldn't she sell them? O cuz she's rich?! So that means she has to give her stuff away? I sell my stuff AND I give stuff away. Stop bashing her,” they wrote. Another suggested that the ongoing criticism on Khloé was unfair, claiming she's ""dammed if she do... dammed if she don't,"" perhaps in reference to several other scandals she's been caught up in recently. “No matter what! She dammed if she do ….,.she dammed if she don’t ,there’s nothing wrong with selling her daughters clothes, she’s a good person just keep getting a bad rap. I’m so glad she had her own mind,” the user tweeted. One person wrote, “I don’t see anything wrong with her selling The clothes her daughter no longer is going to wear. A lot of those do the same in yard sales the problem is the price is too high for used clothes no matter who it’s from or what brand it is."" Defending the expensive prices, one fan suggested that it’s likely True had “never worn” these clothes or had only “worn them once.” And while it’s not confirmed, many people speculated that Khloé may have been sent these clothes by various designers — a practice common among the KarJenner bunch — especially because she's been called out for selling gifted pieces in the past. As fans might recall, Khloé came under fire back in June 2020, after designer Christian Cowan publicly criticized her for selling an apparent loaned runway sample on her family’s Kloset. Khloé listed the luxury dress — which was a part of the designer’s 2019 Powerpuff Girls collaboration — for $1,300 on the website, though was quickly put on blast by Christian in a public Instagram story. He wrote, “Why are my runway samples I loaned you being sold on your website?” alongside a screenshot showing the dress available to buy on the Kardashians’ website. Though Khloé never publicly addressed the scandal, eagle-eyed fans noticed that the dress was unavailable on the site shortly after Christian’s post."
35,"Amid rising tensions and the approaching Beijing Olympics, the US banned Xinjiang cotton last year. But Hugo Boss still took shipments from Esquel, which gins cotton in Xinjiang.","


This project was supported by the International Women’s Media Foundation.
 


On a balmy day in March, a container ship called the One Munchen docked in Savannah, Georgia. On board was a shipment of button-down shirts made of “peached cotton,” a fuzzy fabric meant to feel as soft as the skin of the fruit. Embroidered on their pockets was the Hugo Boss logo.Now on sale for $82, the shirts feature a slim fit, an embroidered placket, and a promise: Hugo Boss had not sourced its cotton from China’s Xinjiang region, where forced labor is rampant. But these button-downs — along with dozens of other clothing shipments brought into the United States within the last year by Hugo Boss, Tommy Hilfiger, and other clothing brands — were produced by a large Chinese company called Esquel Group. And that’s a red flag.
 


Forced labor is so pervasive in China's far west region of Xinjiang — and government control over information is so absolute — that it is nearly impossible to establish if forced labor is being used in supply chains there. But here’s what is known:Esquel Group gins and spins cotton in Xinjiang.In July 2020, the US government placed trade restrictions on one of its Xinjiang subsidiaries, Changji Esquel Textile Co., citing concerns over forced labor.In January 2021, US regulators banned all Xinjiang cotton from entering the US, again citing forced labor.Since the cotton ban, a different Esquel subsidiary located in Guangdong — hundreds of miles away from Xinjiang — has continued exporting its clothes to brands in the US. But procurement records and company statements reviewed by BuzzFeed News show that Esquel’s Guangdong branch works together with its Xinjiang-based cotton spinning factories. When asked repeatedly, neither Hugo Boss nor Tommy Hilfiger nor Ralph Lauren would say where the cotton in their Esquel shipments comes from.Esquel’s own public statements make clear that its Xinjiang cotton production is deeply intertwined with its worldwide clothing operation. The company describes itself as “vertically integrated,” meaning that it owns factories for each stage of the cotton supply chain: Esquel’s gins separate cotton fibers from seeds, and those fibers are later spun into yarn in Esquel’s spinning mills. Esquel’s Guangdong factories knit and weave cotton yarn to make cloth, then use this to manufacture clothing that can be exported to the rest of the world via the Hong Kong–based Esquel Enterprises. The company owns at least two cotton ginning companies in Xinjiang, where the bulk of China’s cotton is grown — but makes no public reference to owning any cotton ginning facilities outside the region.Since the US ban against all Xinjiang cotton began last January, at least 16 Esquel shipments have arrived in the US for Hugo Boss, trade records show, the latest one in mid-December. One shipment has arrived addressed to PVH, the parent company of Tommy Hilfiger, containing Tommy Hilfiger–branded goods; four for Ralph Lauren; and one for Polo, a Ralph Lauren subsidiary. Guangdong Esquel, along with other Esquel companies, is still listed as a supplier in Hugo Boss’s most recently published supplier list. PVH had included Guangdong Esquel on its supplier list, as well as Esquel subsidiaries in Vietnam and Sri Lanka, but in late December — after BuzzFeed News reached out for comment — PVH released an updated version of its list, and no Esquel subsidiaries were on it. No Esquel companies appear in Ralph Lauren’s latest list, which was published in November.Hugo Boss said in a statement that it had contacted Esquel, and the company had replied that “all our specifications and standards, including the observance of human rights and fair working conditions, have been and are being complied with.” Hugo Boss also said its own audits at Esquel production facilities revealed no evidence of the use of forced labor.PVH and Ralph Lauren did not respond to requests for comment.In response to a list of questions, Esquel said it had never used and would never use coerced or forced labor. It added that it follows all national import and export laws, and that it does not sell products banned in specific jurisdictions.Asked what regions it sources cotton from other than Xinjiang, Esquel did not give any specifics, saying only that it sources from “most of the key cotton producing countries globally.”The Esquel shipments raise questions not only about whether these brands continue to sell products that use cotton grown in Xinjiang but also about whether the US ban is truly enforceable.“Cotton is grown in Xinjiang, but then it is sold to warehouses, processors, and suppliers all over China,” said Laura Murphy, professor of human rights and contemporary slavery at Sheffield Hallam University, who has conducted research on forced labor in Xinjiang. And then it moves on as raw cotton or as yarn and fabric to the rest of the world. “Every time it moves, its provenance is increasingly obscured. There are many ways to track it, but so far most companies don’t seem invested in knowing where their raw cotton comes from.”A Customs and Border Protection spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that under US law, importers must take “reasonable care” in ensuring their supply chains are free of forced labor. Asked what constitutes “reasonable care,” the spokesperson said companies are encouraged to “become familiar with applicable laws and regulations” and work with the agency to protect consumers from “harmful and counterfeit imports.”As part of its campaign targeting Muslims, the Chinese government has put in place labor programs in which Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities are made to work on farms and in factories. The US has labeled the campaign a genocide and has applied increasing pressure on the Chinese government, including a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. The US has continued to escalate trade prohibitions during that time: The US banned cotton and tomato imports from the region in January 2021, but last month Congress passed a law mandating that all goods from Xinjiang must be stopped at the border on suspicion that they are made with forced labor, placing the burden of proof on importers.The region has long been a top source of cotton for international companies. China is currently the world’s leading producer of cotton, with over 87% of that coming from Xinjiang. Research shows that forced labor in the region is not restricted to factory work — there is also evidence of forced labor in cotton picking in southern Xinjiang.The Xinjiang cotton ban has become a flashpoint in the larger diplomatic row between the US and China, with the Chinese government, along with Chinese consumers and celebrities, pressuring international clothing brands to continue sourcing in the region as a show of patriotic support.Human rights groups welcomed the ban but were skeptical it could be fully enforced. They say forced labor by Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minority groups, underpinned by government programs, is so widespread in Xinjiang that it’s nearly impossible for any companies that source there to ensure their suppliers don’t use it. The political sensitivity of the issue, combined with the government’s other repressive measures targeting minority groups, has made it even more difficult for foreign companies to audit their supply chains.The Better Cotton Initiative, an industry group that promotes sustainability by auditing its supply chains, stopped its reviews in Xinjiang altogether in October 2020, citing “an increasingly untenable operating environment.” Five firms did the same.Esquel is the world’s largest maker of woven cotton shirts, providing major brands with more than 100 million every year, earning the company more than $1.3 billion in yearly revenue. Esquel operates two cotton ginning mills in Xinjiang and three spinning mills, where cotton is spun into yarn. BuzzFeed News was able to geolocate the three spinning mills in Xinjiang and the garment factories in Guangdong, matching images of these facilities on Esquel’s website with satellite imagery and street-level imagery from Baidu Total View and confirming their locations. The book Esquel produced to celebrate the company’s 40th anniversary describes how its spinning mill in Xinjiang’s Turpan prefecture was established specifically to supply the Guangdong factories. By 2018, the book adds, Esquel’s investment in Xinjiang amounted to $100 million, including charitable donations. The company did not answer a question about whether that supply route has changed.
 


Esquel has said publicly that it uses long-staple cotton, which is prized in the industry for its durability and luxe feel. About a fifth of the world’s long-staple cotton is produced in Xinjiang’s Aksu prefecture, and according to the company’s website, Esquel has two subsidiaries based in Aksu: Akesu Esquel Agricultural Development Company Ltd. and Akesu Esquel Cotton Industrial Company Ltd. Esquel’s own literature describes Awati County in Aksu as the “Home of China’s ELS Cotton,” referring to extra-long-staple cotton, and said it became “a major plantation site of Esquel’s quality cotton” starting in 2002. In addition to China, the company has cloth and garment production facilities in Vietnam and Sri Lanka.Hugo Boss is a member of the Better Cotton Initiative and says that 86% of its purchased cotton is “sustainable,” citing environmental standards as well as “socio-economic factors.”
 


In July 2020, following a report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute on Uyghur forced labor, the US announced sanctions against 11 Chinese companies including Changji Esquel Textile, one of the five Esquel subsidiaries based in Xinjiang. The sanctions announcement described these companies as being “implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and high-technology surveillance against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.” These sanctions made it difficult, but not impossible, for US brands to trade with the companies outright — but the reputational damage meant that brands were reluctant to be seen working with them.Nike, which the ASPI report had named as working with Changji Esquel, issued a statement denying any relationship to the company. Hugo Boss said that it was asking all of its suppliers whether they were using any products made in Xinjiang. (Esquel launched an appeal, saying that the company “does not use forced labor” and “never will use forced labor.” But in October, a federal judge refused to lift trade curbs on the company.)
 


The January 2021 ban on all Xinjiang cotton added a further layer of restriction and put major clothing brands under a fresh spotlight. Hugo Boss posted conflicting promises about what it would do next.In Chinese, on the company’s official Weibo account, Hugo Boss said, “we will continue to purchase and support Xinjiang cotton … For many years, we have respected the one-China principle, resolutely defending national sovereign and territorial integrity.” Around the same time, the company said in an English-language statement that it had “not procured any goods in the Xinjiang region from direct suppliers.”Hugo Boss later walked the Chinese language statement back, saying it had not been authorized. That led Chinese celebrities to cancel deals with the brand as part of a pressure campaign to keep it from backing down.With the Xinjiang bans in force, Esquel continued to export clothes through its other subsidiaries based in Guangdong province and Hong Kong. Trade records on the Panjiva platform, the supply-chain research unit at S&P Global Market Intelligence, show 36 Esquel Enterprises shipments have arrived at US ports since the introduction of sanctions, including Seattle; Savannah, Georgia; Newark, New Jersey; New York; Los Angeles; Long Beach, California; Pittsburgh; Baltimore; and Boston. According to the trade records, their combined value was $1,473,490. Hugo Boss’s most recent shipment arrived at the Port of Seattle on Dec. 18, bound for Hugo Boss Canada. Advertisement  Sixteen of those shipments went to Hugo Boss. BuzzFeed News was able to identify 30 different clothing products from these shipments — including white button-down blouses branded as “organic cotton poplin.” BuzzFeed News then found these items being sold under the Hugo Boss brand both by the brand’s own website and by other retailers, including ModeSens and Amazon. ModeSens did not respond to a request for comment, and Amazon declined to comment.
 


BuzzFeed News matched items of clothing sold online with those described in shipping records using the eight-digit numerical “style codes” associated with them, which also appear on the websites where they are being sold. Hugo Boss also named three Esquel factories in Guangdong in its most recently published supplier list in May 2021. Advertisement  
 


A document seen by BuzzFeed News shows how Esquel’s Xinjiang branch works with its Guangdong operation. At the start of August, Xinjiang Esquel issued a joint tender with the Guangdong branch, requesting bids for the transport of cotton materials. The winner of the bid would go under contract with the two Esquel branches between Aug. 1, 2021, and Jan. 31 of this year, according to the document. The companies sought suppliers that had recently gone through qualification inspections that year.On Dec. 2, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights launched a criminal complaint in the Netherlands against Dutch apparel brands that source from Esquel companies among other Chinese suppliers with Xinjiang ties. The group argues that Esquel’s “vertically integrated” structure all but ensures that the cotton it gins in Xinjiang ends up with its other subsidiaries that export clothes to Western countries. “It is unacceptable that European governments criticize China for human rights violations while these companies possibly profit from the exploitation of the Uyghur population,” said Corina Ajder, a legal adviser at ECCHR. “It is high time that responsible corporate officers are investigated and — if necessary — held to account.” The group filed a similar complaint in France in April and in Germany in September. The German filing named Hugo Boss, along with other German-registered companies. Hugo Boss has said it rejects the claims made by ECCHR. Advertisement  Tommy Hilfiger’s owner, the American apparel giant PVH, also owns brands including Calvin Klein. PVH told the New York Times in July 2020 that it would end its relationships with fabric producers in Xinjiang, as well as cotton suppliers from the region, within a year.An examination of trade records shows that the Chinese Esquel factories exported at least 12 different styles of Tommy Hilfiger–branded clothing to the United States in February. Several of these items are still on sale on the brand’s website, albeit currently sold out.Matching the products’ style codes to Tommy Hilfiger products sold on its website shows they range from sweaters and pullovers to knit skirts and dresses. One cream-colored crewneck sweater, which bears the brand’s logo, is advertised as being made with “organic cotton,” as were other products. The clothing sells for between $68 and $150.●

37,Democrats failed to pass a voting rights package they repeatedly touted as necessary to stamp out voter suppression after Republicans successfully filibustered the bill.,"


WASHINGTON — Democrats failed to change Senate rules on Wednesday to pass a voting rights package that they repeatedly touted as necessary to stamp out voter suppression.The votes on the bill and the rule were a culmination of two major political issues facing the country: Whether the federal government should step in to reverse state-level laws seen as restricting access to the polls, and whether a minority party in the Senate should have effective veto power over almost all legislation moving through Congress. Advertisement     Democrats lost on both fronts, marking a disappointing final day of Biden’s difficult first year in office. State governments will continue to have broad authority to taper voting laws and Republicans in the minority will continue to have the power to block progressive legislation.It was a foregone conclusion that the bill would fail. Biden conceded as much last week. But in a rare move, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer pushed the votes forward despite it being a divisive issue for his party. Ultimately Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia both voted to advance the voting rights bill, but against making the necessary change to Senate rules to allow it to pass.With all Republicans opposed, the move to change the filibuster rules failed in a vote of 48–52.Manchin said he could not support one party changing Senate rules “through raw majority power” without the cooperation of the full Senate. “Let the change happen this way and it will be a body without rules,” he said. Advertisement     Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor just before the final vote that he was seeking a modest, one-time exception to the rules in order to reverse voter suppression across the country.“The only way to achieve our goal of passing voter rights, ending dark money, and ending partisan gerrymandering is by changing the rules,” he said. ""Because our colleagues from the other side of the aisle don’t want to join us in these noble endeavors.""Biden said in a statement after the vote that he was ""profoundly disappointed that the United States Senate has failed to stand up for our democracy,"" but that he was not ""deterred.""In an afternoon press conference, the president refused to give up on making progress on voting rights through the rest of his term. “We’re not there yet. We’ve not run out of options yet,” he said. ""We’ll see how this moves.""Named after the late civil rights icon and member of Congress John Lewis, the voting rights package would have rolled back dozens of state-level access restrictions, mandated at least 15 days of early voting, made Election Day a federal holiday, and allowed the courts and federal government to intervene if a state passes restrictions that target voters of ethnic and racial minorities.Last year, Republicans put in place 33 laws across 19 states to make voting more restrictive.The Senate filibuster evokes the image of senators talking for hours to block legislation, but in fact senators can filibuster a bill just by staying home. The Senate rules require at least 60 votes in the 100-seat chamber to end debate and move to a final vote. This allows for a minority of senators to block legislation.In the current 50–50 split Senate, with Democrats only in control because Vice President Kamala Harris casts tiebreaking votes, there was no chance of bypassing the filibuster. But while it takes 60 votes to pass a bill, a simple majority of senators can vote to do away with the filibuster — either entirely or in certain circumstances. This process is often referred to as the “nuclear option.”While many Democrats support getting rid of the filibuster altogether, Thursday’s vote would have carved out an exception for this bill only.The Senate initially voted on whether to end debate on the voting rights bill. That deadlocked along party lines, well short of the 60 needed. Schumer then put forward a vote to change the rules so that senators could continue to filibuster by talking, but eventually debate would end and a vote would commence. That fell 48–52, with Manchin and Sinema defecting. Advertisement     The filibuster has become a powerful tool of obstruction. When he was majority leader, Mitch McConnell boasted about turning the Senate into a graveyard of progressive legislation. Thanks to the filibuster, he can maintain that status quo in the minority.At the same time, frustration with the rules has caused both parties to pass exemptions when they have been in the majority. Former Democratic Senate majority leader Harry Reid nuked the filibuster, via a majority vote, for some judicial nominations during the Obama years. He said it was necessary to bypass Republican obstruction.When Donald Trump was president, McConnell erased the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations when Democrats blocked him from getting 60 votes to confirm Neil Gorsuch.McConnell also took an aggressive approach to budget reconciliation bills, which are exempt from the filibuster. Typically used to simply authorize spending for the year, Republicans tried to use budget reconciliation to repeal the Affordable Care Act.That ultimately fell short, but Democrats are now attempting to use budget reconciliation to pass practically all of their domestic and climate change agenda via the Build Back Better Act. That bill currently remains stalled in the Senate due to opposition from Manchin.The filibuster now sits on odd historic ground. Both parties aggressively use the filibuster and aggressively circumvent it. Many believe its days are numbered.The filibuster is not mentioned in the Constitution and in fact arose from a gap in the country’s founding documents. There was no mechanism for ending debate in the Senate until 1917, when senators voted to adopt a rule to close debate with a vote of two-thirds of the chamber. In 1975 that threshold was lowered to 60 votes.McConnell on Wednesday night accused Democrats of hypocrisy for using the filibuster when they were in the minority. “That’s why many of them look so foolish, because they’ve been on the opposite side of this. Not long ago but quite recently,” he said on the floor.While Republicans were unanimously opposed to the broader voting rights package, some have expressed openness to reforming the Electoral Count Act of 1887. That law lays out how Congress counts and certifies Electoral College votes in a presidential election. Advertisement     Trump and his allies had hoped to exploit ambiguities in that law to overturn the results of the 2020 election. That would have involved then–vice president Mike Pence rejecting the state-approved slate of electors and potentially replacing them with pro-Trump slates. Pence did not go along with the idea and approved the state electors who confirmed Joe Biden won the presidency.Some senators have talked about rewriting the bill to make it explicit that the vice president plays only a procedural role and does not have the discretion to reject the electors sent by the state. It is not clear whether there is enough Republican support to amend the law.

38,"The move comes weeks after Starbucks employees from a Buffalo, New York, shop walked out after growing concerns for their health and safety.","


Starbucks will no longer require its US employees to be vaccinated or submit weekly tests for COVID-19 after the Supreme Court blocked the Biden administration's vaccine-or-test rule for large corporations.John Culver, the president of North America and chief operating officer for Starbucks, announced the decision in a memo sent to staff Tuesday.“I want to emphasize that we continue to believe strongly in the spirit and intent of the mandate,” Culver wrote in the memo. He added that ""the health, safety and wellbeing of every partner remains our top priority."" Advertisement     Last week, the Supreme Court voted 6–3 to pause the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's emergency temporary standard that instructed businesses with 100 or more workers to require them to be vaccinated or submit weekly COVID test results. However, the ruling does not prevent businesses from enforcing their own vaccine requirements.According to Culver's memo, 90% of Starbucks employees have disclosed their vaccine status, and the ""vast majority"" are fully vaccinated. A Starbucks spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that they did not have an exact number of fully vaccinated employees.In his memo, Culver wrote that Starbucks ""strongly"" encourages its employees to get vaccinated and boosted.""We will continue to follow the facts and science as we make our decisions and ensure partners understand their options,"" he added.The decision comes as Starbucks deals with a unionization effort among its ranks. In December, one store in Buffalo, New York, successfully unionized, and another in Cheektowaga unionized earlier this month. On Jan. 5, the Buffalo Starbucks workers walked out to protest workplace safety measures as COVID cases surged.""Starbucks reversed their vaccine mandate without discussing the issue, or negotiating about it, with the unionized partners at the Elmwood and Genesee stores,"" a spokesperson for Starbucks Workers United said in a statement. ""This comes after partners at Elmwood raised COVID safety concerns that the company rebuffed. Once again, this shows why Starbucks partners need a union to have a voice in these critical matters.""In March 2020, BuzzFeed News reported that Starbucks employees felt unsafe working through the beginning of the pandemic, describing ""chaos, fear, and confusion"" at stores around the country. In Culver's memo to staff on Tuesday, he wrote that Starbucks will ""prioritize safety at work by continuing to emphasize our health and safety protocols and modifying store operations when and where needed"" and ""provide partners access to meaningful benefits like self-isolation pay, vaccine pay, booster pay and side effect pay.""

39,Only Justice Clarence Thomas made clear that he would have intervened on Trump’s behalf.,"


WASHINGTON — The US Supreme Court on Wednesday denied former president Donald Trump’s effort to stop the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection from getting nearly 800 pages of White House records he’d tried to claim were protected by executive privilege.A majority of justices refused to intervene and disturb lower court decisions that had cleared the way for the National Archives to turn over the collection of contested documents to the committee. Only Justice Clarence Thomas noted a dissent from the court’s decision, indicating he would have granted Trump’s request for a longer-term injunction blocking the committee from getting the documents as the legal fight went forward. Advertisement     The only thing stopping the Archives from turning over the documents to the committee at this point was a temporary order from a federal appeals court from December that had kept the documents in limbo while Trump tried to convince the justices to step in. That lower court injunction was set to expire once the Supreme Court ruled on Trump’s latest motion.The Trump-era White House records at issue include presidential diaries, schedules, call logs, handwritten notes, drafts of speeches and correspondence, proposed talking points, “a draft Executive Order on the topic of election integrity,” a memo about potential legal action the federal government could take to challenge President Joe Biden’s wins in key states (the Justice Department filed no such case), and an email chain that involved a state official “regarding election-related issues,” according to descriptions of the documents submitted as part of the legal fight.Just over two hours after the Supreme Court released its order, Democratic committee chair Bennie Thompson and Republican vice chair Liz Cheney put out a joint statement appearing to confirm that they'd already started receiving documents.""The Supreme Court’s action tonight is a victory for the rule of law and American democracy,"" Thompson and Cheney said. ""The Select Committee has already begun to receive records that the former President had hoped to keep hidden and we look forward to additional productions regarding this important information. Our work goes forward to uncover all the facts about the violence of January 6th and its causes."" Advertisement     Former presidents can try to assert executive privilege over their archived White House records, but the incumbent has to back that claim for it to have legal effect. Biden refused to do so when Trump claimed the privilege in response to the committee’s requests to the Archives. At each stage of the fight in the lower courts, judges were skeptical of Trump’s argument that former officeholders should have broad discretion to take a sitting president to court to challenge their refusal to invoke executive privilege on the predecessor’s behalf.To fulfill the committee’s request for White House records leading up to the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 insurrection as well as the period immediately after, the national archivist identified sets of records on a rolling basis in what are referred to as tranches. The fight in the district court and the DC Circuit had focused on the first three tranches. Trump didn’t object to all of the documents going to the committee — some have already been turned over — but claimed 763 pages from those three sets of records should be shielded by executive privilege. The Archives was also poised on Wednesday to produce another four pages from an additional tranche over Trump’s objection; the Supreme Court’s decision clears the path for those documents to go to the committee as well.Trump lost twice in the lower courts in his bid to stop the Jan. 6 committee from getting various categories of his White House records that he maintained should be protected by executive privilege. On Nov. 9, a federal district judge in Washington, DC, rejected Trump’s request for an injunction that would stop the National Archives from turning over the documents. A month later, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit again sided against Trump, upholding the district court’s decision in a 3–0 order.“On the record before us, former President Trump has provided no basis for this court to override President Biden’s judgment and the agreement and accommodations worked out between the Political Branches over these documents,” DC Circuit Judge Patricia Millett wrote for the appeals court. “Both Branches agree that there is a unique legislative need for these documents and that they are directly relevant to the Committee’s inquiry into an attack on the Legislative Branch and its constitutional role in the peaceful transfer of power.” Advertisement     The Supreme Court’s Wednesday order stated that because the DC Circuit had concluded that Trump’s legal challenge would fail regardless of his status as a former president, anything that the appeals court had to say about when a former president could sue over executive privilege wasn’t binding going forward. The questions that Trump’s case presented “are unprecedented and raise serious and substantial concerns,” the majority wrote; the order wasn’t signed by any specific justice.Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote separately to say that he believed there had to be circumstances where a former president could successfully invoke privilege over their administration records even if the incumbent refused to back it. “Concluding otherwise,” Kavanaugh wrote, “would eviscerate the executive privilege for Presidential communications.”Although Trump repeatedly lost the legal arguments his lawyers tried to make in court, he succeeded in delaying the committee from getting his records. The Archives were originally set to begin turning over documents on Nov. 12, 2021. Trump filed suit in mid-October, and while he appealed his loss in the district court, the DC Circuit agreed to temporarily block the Archives from taking action. The panel then gave Trump another 14 days to petition the Supreme Court to step in, and once he did that, it extended the pause even further until the justices ruled.Trump filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court in late December asking for an immediate injunction to stop the Archives from turning over any records he’d claimed executive privilege over until the justices fully considered the case. His request noted that the DC Circuit had specified that its temporary pause only applied to the first three tranches of documents, and that the archivist had identified a fourth tranche and planned to give it to the committee on Jan. 19 barring a court order.Trump had claimed executive privilege over six pages in the fourth tranche, which featured approximately 550 pages. His lawyers argued that the Supreme Court should block any production of contested documents “for the sake of judicial efficiency and because of the similarity of the legal issues between the various tranches.” Advertisement     The final brief was filed in the Supreme Court on Jan. 13. On the evening of Jan. 18, the Justice Department submitted a letter to the DC Circuit confirming that the Archives planned to turn over the fourth tranche at the end of the next day unless any court told the agency not to do so. The government’s lawyers wrote that the archivist had been poised to produce that collection shortly after the DC Circuit’s decision in December, but Biden ordered a delay to give Trump time to go back to the lower courts to argue for another injunction.The Justice Department specified that the archivist was prepared to turn over four of the six pages that Trump had objected to, since two were similar to documents in the first three tranches that remained in limbo.Trump’s lead attorney Jesse Binnall did not immediately return a request for comment, nor did a spokesperson for the National Archives.

40,"“What are they for? Name me one thing they’re for,” Biden said during a press conference.","


One year after taking office and seeing Senate Republicans block most of his policy agenda, President Joe Biden said he “did not anticipate” their obstructionism and conceded that he will need to break up his wide-ranging social program and climate change bill to get it passed.""I did not anticipate that there'd be such a stalwart effort to make sure that the most important thing was that President Biden didn't get anything done,"" Biden said in a press conference on Wednesday, marking his first year in office. Advertisement     Biden has in recent weeks more bluntly criticized Republicans stymying his policy agenda, particularly as he has come under pressure from voting rights leaders to push through voting reforms before the midterm elections, and contends with ongoing low approval ratings. The White House has said for months that the American people will ultimately judge Democrats on what they’ve achieved in terms of legislation that affects their daily lives.“Think about this: What are Republicans for? What are they for? Name me one thing they’re for,” he said on Wednesday.Earlier this month, he directly called out former president Donald Trump for pushing election conspiracy theories, and last week he criticized Senate Republicans for blocking voting rights legislation. On Wednesday, he admitted that he had hoped to be able to foster greater cooperation between the two parties than he has.""One of the things I haven't been able to get done is to get my Republican friends to get in the game of making things better in this country,” he said, denying that he had overpromised on his agenda early on. Advertisement     Running for office on the heels of a president who frequently pushed divisive rhetoric and inflamed tensions between Americans, Biden ran on a platform of being able to bridge partisan gaps and get things done in Washington. On the campaign trail, he often referred to his 36 years in the Senate working across the aisle and took pains to reiterate his view that Republicans at large were not the enemy.In his victory speech in November 2020, Biden made the case that Americans across the political spectrum — including Democrats and Republicans in Congress — should learn to cooperate again.“The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control,” Biden said. “It’s a decision. It’s a choice we make,” he said in that speech.On the campaign trail, he struck an even more conciliatory tone, telling reporters in December 2019 that he didn't want the Republican party to be totally ""clobbered.""""I'm really worried that no party should have too much power,"" he said. ""You need a countervailing force,” he said at the time.Black voting rights advocates have been frustrated to see the administration’s lack of progress on federal protections while Republican-led state and local governments enact dozens of restrictive voting laws across the country. In particular, grassroots advocates have felt that Biden has neglected an issue of vital importance to the same people — Black voters in the South — who helped him gain office in the first place.“You had President Biden saying that he understood that Black people were the reason why he was elected, and in fact, Black people turned out to vote in huge numbers,” said Amara Enyia, policy and research coordinator for the Movement for Black Lives, calling Biden blaming Republicans for not getting voting rights passed “kind of a cop-out.”“It's quite disappointing considering the rhetoric that they use to get people engaged in the process during election season,” she said.“Now we find we’re in this 11th hour with these debates happening and it’s not looking promising. It’s really disappointing. But I think it’s pretty illustrative of the Biden administration’s term so far,” she said.Another voting rights advocate, Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson, a Movement for Black Lives spokesperson and director of the Highlander Research and Education Center, said the White House’s messaging that advocates on the ground aren’t aware of the difficulty of passing voting rights is “insulting.” Advertisement     “Prioritizing bipartisanship over the very lives of the people that fought to get him into office, right, and I worry that if he doesn't put up, what it's gonna look like in the midterms for our people,” she said.Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party, said that while the American Rescue Plan and other initiatives did provide relief for Black communities in the midst of the pandemic, voting reform and criminal justice reform are central to the promises Biden made to the Black voters who helped him win the presidency.Biden, asked about these criticisms from Black voters on the ground on Wednesday, was defensive — and put their frustration down to a lack of communication on his part to the public about his conversations behind the scenes to shore up Democrat support for the legislation.“I've had their back, I've had their back my entire career, I’ve never not had their back,” he said.“I’m sure there are those who are saying ‘Why didn’t Biden push the John Lewis bill as hard as he pushed it last month? Why didn’t he push it six months ago as hard as he did now?” Biden said. “The fact is that there is a timing that is not one’s own choice, but dictated by events happening in-country and around the world on what the focus is.”“I find myself in a position where I don't get to go out and look people in the eye … to connect with people, to let them take a measure of my sincerity,” he added.Mitchell said that while he appreciated Biden and Harris traveling to Georgia last week to speak on voting rights, and that those kinds of pushes are also important, for Black voters “it's only as important in the context of action.”

41,"Though Britney Spears is now free of the conservatorship that controlled her life for almost 14 years, a legal fight is continuing over attorneys’ fees and other money matters.","


LOS ANGELES — Britney Spears’ attorney accused her father of wasting her fortune, revealing new details about how Jamie Spears’ oversight of her conservatorship allegedly allowed him to enrich himself and his friends.A Tuesday court filing, which is aimed at blocking Jamie Spears’ request that the 40-year-old pop star continue to pay his legal fees even though she is no longer in a conservatorship, details years of alleged financial misconduct and abuse. Among the accusations, Spears’ attorney Mathew Rosengart claims that Jamie Spears paid himself more than $6 million from his daughter’s estate, used his role as her conservator to benefit his own career as a chef, and isolated the singer by silencing and removing those who disagreed with him or the court-mandated arrangement. Advertisement     And during a heated court hearing on Wednesday, Rosengart said he is now seeking more information on alleged surveillance, including whether Jamie Spears read his daughter's communication with her then-lawyer and then-therapist.“These are significant, serious, credible allegations,” Rosengart told the judge.Among the documents filed this week was a 27-page declaration from former FBI special agent Sherine Ebadi, now a forensic investigator at Kroll Associates Inc., who corroborated, among other things, the alarming allegations revealed by the New York Times’ Controlling Britney Spears documentary that Jamie Spears monitored ​​all communication on his daughter's phone and instructed her security team to place an audio recorder in her bedroom. The efforts to surveil Britney Spears included her romantic interests, her mother Lynne Spears, and even her massage therapist, according to the documents.The new details came as Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny works to resolve pending requests to pay the attorneys who represented Spears and her conservators, as well as reports accounting for the money that went into and came out of her estate in 2019 and on. On Wednesday, Penny approved a petition to pay Spears' former conservator Jodi Montgomery, who oversaw the singer's personal affairs for two years, and her attorneys. The judge also heard arguments related to Jamie Spears’ petition asking that his daughter’s estate pay for his new attorney, Alex Weingarten, who charges $1,200 an hour. Advertisement     “Plainly, giving James Spears’s new lawyers a blank check to be paid 80% of their fees for defending his misconduct—and leaving Britney in the unenviable position of having to litigate to [claw] back waste—is not in Ms. Spears’s best interests,” Rosengart wrote in his filing Tuesday. “Instead, it would open a Pandora’s box of mischief.”Jamie Spears' attorneys did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News' request for comment. But during Wednesday's hearing, Weingarten called the misconduct allegations against his client ""bogus.""""They're all nonsense, they're either demonstratively false or taken out of context,"" he told the court. ""It's important [to say] because these are hearings that are being covered and watched by the world.""He also accused Rosengart of leaking sealed reports to the press and said that the pop star was spreading false information in her Instagram posts.""Lies!"" Rosengart retorted as he denied sharing confidential documents with reporters.During the hearing, Rosengart called for the judge to consider the matter of attorneys' fees in a new hearing that would include evidence of the newly alleged misconduct. A court date of July 27 was set to deal with those issues.Attorneys for Britney Spears and Lynne Spears also agreed to return on March 16 to discuss the mother's request that her daughter's estate cover approximately $650,000 in legal fees that her attorneys say were incurred fighting the conservatorship.Jamie Spears was removed by the court as conservator of the pop star’s estate in September, and the conservatorship was ultimately terminated in November. The unraveling of the legal arrangement, which allowed him and others to control her life and finances for more than 13 years, came after Britney Spears publicly denounced the conservatorship as “abusive” in an explosive hearing last summer.
 


Since then, the singer's new legal team has been investigating her father's administration of her affairs. In previous court filings, her attorneys raised objections to a number of payments that Jamie Spears had made in recent years. If they find evidence that he misappropriated his daughter’s money or engaged in any other misconduct, as Tuesday’s filing suggests they have, Rosengart has said she will sue.According to the documents, Jamie Spears’ misconduct goes all the way back to 2008, when he first petitioned the court to create the conservatorship. At the time, he did not have a steady income and owed at least $40,000 to Tri Star Sports & Entertainment, the business management firm run by his friend Lou Taylor, for a loan the company had provided him, the documents said. Still, despite the inherent conflict of interest, Jamie Spears hired Tri Star to manage the conservatorship, an arrangement that allegedly allowed the company to reap millions of dollars from Britney Spears’ estate.According to the documents, Jamie Spears later authorized $153,759 from Britney Spears’ estate to pay for Taylor’s legal fees in a lawsuit she filed against a #FreeBritney supporter who created a parody site under her name. He did this even though his own attorneys concluded that there was “no connection” between the pop star and the lawsuit and that having her estate pay for Taylor’s legal fees was a “tenuous” request, according to the filing.Britney Spears’ legal team also claimed that Jamie Spears had used her money to pay for his personal legal fees related to the domestic violence restraining order issued against him after he allegedly physically attacked one of her sons, then–13-year-old Sean Preston, during a custody visit in 2019.The documents also allege that Jamie Spears engaged in “self-dealing” with regard to properties his daughter owned in Louisiana and his attempts to restart his career as a cook. In one instance, he allegedly sold parcels she owned at a loss of $800,000. Britney Spears’ legal team also alleges in the filing that her father had persuaded his daughter’s tour staff to help him pitch a television show called “Cookin’ Cruzin’ & Chaos With James Spears” and used money he took from her estate to retrofit a tour bus for his catering business. Advertisement     The investigation into this issue and other allegations of misconduct is ongoing, according to the documents, but Rosengart contended that had it not been for the money Jamie Spears reaped from his daughter’s estate he would not have been able to afford the bus.“If Mr. Spears could afford to buy himself a tour bus worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, using money that—one way or another—came from Britney’s Estate, he can afford to pay his attorneys to help him satisfy his limited remaining fiduciary duties,” Rosengart wrote.

43,A common theme popping up in violations among those on pretrial release has come from defendants who are reluctant to give up access to firearms.,"


WASHINGTON — Joshua Pruitt’s curfew violations had stacked up in the year after he was charged with participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection and allowed to go home on strict conditions. The final straw for the judge was a string of seven violations around the holidays, with Pruitt’s GPS monitor repeatedly showing that he was not where he was supposed to be, sometimes for hours overnight.US District Judge Timothy Kelly last week granted the prosecutor’s request to place Pruitt in jail as his case went forward, concluding the Tennessee man had “abused” the numerous opportunities he’d been given to come into compliance. During the hearing, Pruitt’s tearful pleas for another chance morphed into angry objections and interruptions over the judge’s repeated warnings to be quiet, and threats to complain about the judge to the press. Advertisement     
 


Pruitt is one of 11 people charged in connection with the attack on the US Capitol who were ordered into custody after initially being released; eight of those cases involved defendants who violated conditions of their pretrial release. Prosecutors have a pending request to put another defendant behind bars, and BuzzFeed News identified at least 16 cases where judges tightened restrictions or issued warnings after finding defendants failed to be in full compliance with the letter, or spirit, of their release conditions.The vast majority of people charged in the Jan. 6 investigation have been allowed to go home while their cases are pending; there are more than 550 defendants with active cases on pretrial release. Most have stayed out of trouble. The small but steady trickle of problems that have cropped up speak to some of the broader challenges judges have faced in deciding when it’s appropriate to send someone back into the community who is accused of being part of the insurrection but isn’t charged with a specific act of violence or a more serious crime.Some judges have expressed concern that evidence of a person’s enthusiastic participation in the insurrection showed, in one judge’s words, “a total disregard for the law and for officials' directives,” even if they weren’t charged with violence. Some judges have been worried about the sway that former president Donald Trump continues to have over his supporters, given his ongoing efforts to promote the lie that the election was stolen. Douglas Jensen of Iowa was returned to jail in the fall for violating a prohibition on internet access after he was caught streaming election fraud conspiracy theory content.A common theme of pretrial release violations in the Jan. 6 cases has been defendants reluctant to give up their access to firearms. At least two people have been accused of trying to interfere with potential witnesses. In the latest case where the government wants a defendant placed in custody, prosecutors claimed that William Norwood III of South Carolina tried to pressure his estranged wife to lie.“I will tell the whole truth,” Norwood’s wife had messaged him, according to the government. “No you won’t,” he allegedly replied. “Do not throw me under the bus … What part of spousal privilege don’t you get???” Norwood has until Feb. 2 to respond; a judge scheduled a hearing for Feb. 23, and he’ll be allowed to remain at home in the meantime. Norwood’s lawyer Peter Cooper declined to comment.Incarcerating a person who hasn’t been convicted of a crime is supposed to be a last resort. It’s common for people charged with misdemeanor offenses or nonviolent crimes to be allowed to live at home while their cases are pending, especially if they have little to no previous criminal record. Last March, a federal appeals court made clear that the bar would be high for the government to win detention for alleged Capitol rioters who weren’t charged with more serious crimes. Prosecutors in the Jan. 6 cases have mostly narrowed pretrial detention requests to people charged with violence and conspiracy; even then, they haven’t always pushed for jail.But violating a judge’s orders, regardless of the underlying charges, opens up new avenues for consequences.
 


Many Capitol riot defendants have temporarily given up their right to own or possess firearms as part of their release conditions. There are at least seven cases where the government identified a gun-related violation. Earlier this week, a judge granted the government’s request to put James Grant of North Carolina in jail. Grant is charged with joining other rioters in using metal barricades to assault police officers at the Capitol. The government didn’t seek detention when he was arrested in October. But a prosecutor returned to court a few months later to ask the judge to revoke Grant’s release, citing multiple violations.In early December, police officers responding to a call of a suicide threat encountered Grant intoxicated in a car, according to the government; they found an assault rifle and 60 rounds of ammunition in the vehicle. The pretrial supervision office had previously alerted the court that Grant tested positive twice for amphetamines after being allowed to go home. The prosecutor also noted that before Grant’s arrest in the Jan. 6 case, he’d been charged in September with driving under the influence and carrying a concealed firearm; that case is pending.Kelly said that Grant’s actions showed he was unwilling or unable to comply with his release conditions, and that he posed a danger to the community. The judge described substance abuse, potential mental health issues, and firearms access as a “toxic combination.” Cooper, who also represents Grant, declined to comment.A judge ordered Thomas Robertson, a former police officer from Virginia, to report to jail in July. The government successfully made the case for detention after discovering that Robertson had been ordering firearms online after being indicted for a felony in connection with the Capitol riot — a potentially chargeable crime on its own — and found a loaded assault rifle and ammunition during a search of his home. In October, Robertson’s lawyer asked the judge to consider releasing his client, writing that jail had taken a toll on his health and that after three months behind bars, the judge could “rest assured that Mr. Robertson completely understands his obligation to the Court now.”US District Judge Christopher Cooper denied the request. He wrote that Robertson hadn’t presented specific information about any health problems and that the “mere passage of time” wasn’t enough.Not everyone who got in trouble for gun-related violations was put in jail. Patrick Montgomery of Colorado was on the cusp of incarceration after the government reported he’d used a handgun to shoot and kill a mountain lion at a park in Denver. A judge ordered him jailed but then accepted an agreement that the government reached with Montgomery to instead place him on strict home incarceration. Matthew Loganbill, who owns a gun store in Missouri, was originally allowed to handle guns in limited circumstances associated with his business. A judge revoked that allowance after learning he’d entered a shooting contest, according to local media reports. Advertisement     Prosecutors opposed Tyler Slaeker’s request to lift the condition barring him from possessing guns, quoting a pretrial supervision report that stated the Washington state man had “complained incessantly” and failed to show he was in compliance; the judge declared the issue moot once Slaeker provided the proof, and declined to change his conditions. A pretrial services officer reported Hunter Ehmke of California after he went to a gun range with a friend and shot at targets. His lawyer explained to the judge that Ehmke “did not understand that possession of a firearm encompasses more than just owning a firearm.” The prosecutor accepted the violation as unintentional, and he remained free.Jensen of Iowa wasn’t the only Jan. 6 defendant whose online activities landed them back before a judge. Patrick Stedman, a New Jersey man who runs a relationship coaching business, received a warning not to contact anyone who might be a witness in his case after the government reported that he tweeted insults about another user that Stedman identified as “the guy who called the feds on me.”Prosecutors raised a concern about a YouTube video that appeared to show far-right media personality Anthime Gionet having an encounter with law enforcement (Gionet is a former BuzzFeed employee). A pretrial services officer told the judge Gionet hadn’t technically violated any release conditions, but said he’d come close by appearing to purposefully agitate people and contact police to create entertainment content. The judge warned Gionet about putting himself in situations where he might actually cross the line. John Sullivan of Utah got a warning after a judge found he’d violated his conditions by buying a smartphone and promoting a group he’d founded during an appearance on the right-wing media platform Infowars.Refusing to cooperate or having a combative relationship with the court officers who handle pretrial supervision landed Landon Copeland of Utah, Pauline Bauer of Pennsylvania, and Brandon Fellows of New York behind bars. Eric Clark of Kentucky was “sternly admonished” by a judge for not reporting to the pretrial services office when he was supposed to, and Jeremy Vorous of Pennsylvania was reprimanded for refusing to let a probation officer into his home. Advertisement     A few Jan. 6 defendants have been charged with unrelated crimes while their DC cases are pending. Joshua Haynes of Virginia was arrested and charged with domestic violence offenses over the summer while he was on home incarceration in connection with his Jan. 6 case. He didn’t oppose having his release status revoked in DC, which meant he’d remain in custody even if he were released in the newer case.Shortly before Emily Hernandez of Missouri was due to appear in court this month to enter a guilty plea, authorities reported that she’d crashed into another car while driving the wrong way on a highway. A woman who was in the other car died and a man was injured; it’s not clear yet what charges Hernandez will face, but she received a citation for driving while intoxicated, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Hernandez stayed on pretrial release after her plea hearing, but the judge in DC tightened her conditions. Slate recently noted that defendants Elias Costianes of Maryland and Kene Lazo of Virginia faced other charges while their Jan. 6 cases are pending, but their dockets didn’t show changes to their release status.Joshua Pruitt’s case is among the oldest. He was arrested on Jan. 6, 2021, for violating a curfew order in Washington, DC, hours after the riot, and admitted to police that he’d gone into the Capitol, according to his charging papers. Prosecutors said he’d joined the Proud Boys in late 2020, and that while he later claimed it was a “drunk mistake,” he was seen in photos from Jan. 5 and Jan. 6 flashing the “OK” symbol often associated with the far-right group and standing with an assault-style rifle on a Black Lives Matter banner similar to the one that the group’s leader Henry “Enrique” Tarrio was convicted of taking from a local church and burning.Pruitt was charged with a federal misdemeanor after his arrest. He was allowed to go home with conditions, including a curfew and a prohibition on having guns. A grand jury later returned an eight-count indictment that included two felony charges, for interfering with police during a civil disorder and obstructing an official proceeding. According to the government, while he was inside the Capitol, he’d thrown a sign that said “Quiet Please” and was part of a confrontation with US Capitol Police officers. Advertisement     
 


The Jan. 6 case wasn’t Pruitt’s first experience with court-ordered supervision. Shortly before the Capitol riot, he’d been arrested for violating civil protection orders in Washington, DC — he later pleaded guilty — and was released with GPS monitoring; he was also on probation from earlier cases in Maryland and Georgia. In arguing to revoke his release, prosecutors wrote that the fact that he allegedly stormed the Capitol while already on GPS monitoring “displayed a brazen disregard for the rule of law.”The government disclosed in its court filing that Pruitt had previously violated his curfew in late January 2021 and in March; those violation notices were under seal on his public docket. In arguing for detention now, the government cited videos he’d posted online where he appeared to be threatening people; Pruitt’s lawyer Robert Jenkins said his client was trying to address threats he’d received. Prosecutors also highlighted an interview with CNN where Pruitt said he didn’t “feel like [he] did anything wrong,” but would hesitate to do it again because of the “consequences”; Jenkins said the CNN quotes were taken out of context, and Pruitt was referring generally to protesting at the Capitol.Judge Timothy Kelly said the videos and CNN interview weighed against Pruitt, but weren’t what convinced him to put Pruitt in jail. He said he was “sympathetic” to defendants who wanted to keep working and had “bent over backwards” to accommodate Pruitt, but could no longer find his explanations for curfew violations credible. Advertisement     “I just don’t believe that he repeatedly is out there in the middle of the night for reasons that are beyond his control,” the judge said.Jenkins said in a phone interview on Wednesday that his client had complied with the judge’s order to self-surrender by Jan. 18 and was in custody. Jenkins said that they didn’t deny that Pruitt violated his curfew, but he maintained that those violations weren’t enough to put Pruitt in jail absent evidence that he’d violated the law or done something dangerous while he was out. ●

44,Looks like we can probably rule out that surprise Samatha cameo…,"Putting speculation to rest, Kim Cattrall just ~very~ subtly let fans know what she thinks of the Sex and the City revival, And Just Like That. As I’m sure you’re aware by now, Kim — who famously played Samantha Jones in the original TV show and its two subsequent movies — made the call not to appear in AJLT, following a long and very messy feud with her costars, namely Sarah Jessica Parker. Since the SATC revival premiered back in December, Kim’s absence has been a huge talking point both on the show and among fans — many of whom have been desperately searching for clues to suggest that Samatha might still make a surprise cameo. However, judging by her latest liked tweets, this seems highly unlikely. On Tuesday night, Kim hopped on to Twitter to celebrate the premiere of her new Hulu show — a How I Met Your Mother spinoff titled How I Met Your Father. And while she was there, liked one particularly shady tweet which called AJTL “trashy” and praised her decision to turn it down. “So proud of @KimCattrall for skipping the trashy S&TC reboot and doing @HIMYFonHulu. She’s wonderful, and so is @HilaryDuff,” one fan wrote, encouraging other viewers to tune into How I Met Your Father. Kim gave the tweet a sneaky seal of approval, marking the very first time that she has publicly discredited the SATC revival since it was announced that she would not be returning to the show. Of course, this isn’t the first time since AJLT aired that Kim has subtly given her thoughts. Just last month, the actor broke her silence by liking a couple of pointed fan tweets, including one which applauded her for “making choices that are right for [her],” with regard to her decision not to reprise the role. “@KimCattrall I am such a fan. With the #SATC reboot happening, they keep bringing you up,” the fan tweet began, making reference to Samantha’s various mentions in the script. “I applaud you for making choices that are right for you. You are not required to do anything you don’t want to do or that won’t make you happy.” Interestingly, the sentiments in that tweet were very similar to one explanation that Kim gave in the past for not taking part in any subsequent SATC revivals. As you may remember, the decade-spanning feud between Kim and her costars reached fever pitch back in 2017 after reports surfaced that the third SATC movie had been scrapped at the last minute due to Kim’s “outrageous demands.” After swiftly shutting down the speculation on Twitter, Kim eventually gave her side of the story during a wide-ranging interview with Piers Morgan where she detailed her “empowered” decision to leave SATC in the past after she was approached about a third movie. In hindsight, Kim may have been glad to have distanced herself from the revival, given its complicated return to our screens. Off the back of mixed reviews from longtime SATC fans, the AJLT writers were also recently hit with intense backlash from viewers over a particularly controversial storyline. 🚨🚨🚨 Before we proceed, this is your official warning: If you’ve not watched the most recent episode of AJLT, turn back now to avoid spoilers! 🚨🚨🚨 If you’re all caught up with the revival, you’ll know that Steve Brady, Miranda’s husband, has been dealt a pretty miserable plotline. Steve — who is played by David Eigenberg — quickly earned his place as a fan favorite after he first appeared as Miranda’s boyfriend in the original series. And as the show has unfolded over the years, he still remains one of the most likable and kind-hearted characters, despite his failings. It’s for this reason that fans were disappointed to see that the once bubbly and confident Steve has been portrayed in the more recent episodes as a passive and bumbling counterpart to Miranda, who seems to be irritated by his existence as she embarks on a secret affair with Che, Carrie’s boss. The writers’ downbeat portrayal of such a beloved character sparked a wave of impassioned criticism from fans, many of whom took to social media to campaign for Steve’s justice. In the wake of the backlash, two of AJTL’s writers were forced to address the controversy, ultimately denying claims that they “hate” Steve. Speaking to Vanity Fair last week, Julie Rottenberg and Elisa Zuritsky — who both wrote on the original series and the revival — defended Steve’s storyline, explaining that “Miranda’s journey is representing another reality.” “We love Steve. We are really invested in the Steve-ness of him. He’s so full of life, and the Steves out there are good guys,” Elisa began, before Julie went on to explain the inspiration behind the controversial storyline. “Miranda’s journey is representing another reality out there, which a lot of people go through — the reevaluations and transitions in life,” she said. “Grown couples grow apart, and people come to epiphanies about what their spouse is or isn’t fulfilling for them. Miranda’s story was very representative of a certain path that a lot of women find themselves on.” A particularly prominent concern about the storyline among viewers is that, despite discussing the issue at great length with her friends, Miranda is yet to come clean to Steve about her affair. Apparently aware of this, the writers assured fans that a confrontation is in the pipeline. With all this in mind, I think it’s fair to say that the long-awaited SATC revival might not have been everything fans wanted it to be. And given the timing of Kim’s subtle dig, maybe it’s not too far-fetched to wonder if she’s an undercover Steve fan too."
45,"Mathew Rosengart is threatening legal action against Jamie Lynn for “publicly airing false or fantastical grievances” in order to “sell books,” just days after Britney accused her of selling a memoir at her “expense.”","


Britney has been vocal about how she felt constrained and abused under the legal arrangement, which saw her life and financial affairs controlled by her father and other lawyers from 2008 until November 2021. Speaking out against the conservatorship in court last year, the singer memorably accused her family, including Jamie Lynn, of doing “nothing” to help.
 


“You of all people know the abuse and wrongdoing Britney had to endure during the conservatorship, after initially growing up with a ‘ruinous,’ alcoholic father. In fact, your own book reportedly states that your father ‘spent most of my life in that cycle of ruinous behavior. His bouts of drinking caused me periods of torment and sorrow,’” the letter says. “As I have previously stated, having endured a 13-year conservatorship that stripped her of civil rights and fundamental liberties, Britney will no longer be bullied by her father or anyone else,” it adds.
 


“The two things that did bother me that my sister said was that my behavior was out of control,"" Britney said in a Twitter post. ""She was never around me much 15 years ago at that time, so why are they even talking about that unless she wants to sell a book at my expense?” 
 


“I hate to burst my sister’s bubble, but my book is not about her. I can’t help that I was born a Spears too, and that some of my experiences involve my sister,” she wrote.“I’ve worked hard since before I was even a teenager, and I’ve built my career in spite of just being someone’s little sister,” she added.
 


“I know you worked hard for the life you have and you have done amazing!!!! But I think we would both have to agree to the fact that the family has never been remotely as hard on you as they have been on me,” she wrote.“All I know is I love you unconditionally,” she went on. “So go ahead and say whatever you want... it's so tacky for a family to fight publicly like this!!! You say you love me... yet your loyalty is still with the people that hurt me the most.”
 


“It’s like my whole life I felt like I didn’t matter,” she said in tears.
 


“I remember him fondly because that was probably one of the best times in the whole family’s life,” she said. “You know, things were good.”Speaking about how she was affected by the split — which saw Britney being scrutinized in the media for years — Jamie Lynn said she was “so sad.”“I think everybody thought it was forever,” she said. “I was so sad [because] my sister was so sad.”
 


“I asked myself every day 'DOES ANYBODY CARE ??? WTF ??? DO I MATTER ???' I would honestly be very interested to see your pretty face in the setting I was forced to be in and asking yourself 'DO I MATTER ???'” she added.“I didn’t get to cry… I had to be strong … TOO STRONG,” she wrote. “So yes … YOU DO MATTER and don’t you ever think for one fucking second you don’t.”
 


“Sit there and get served the chocolate milkshakes with the perfectly crushed ice with the secret chunky sugar meanwhile Jamie Lynn is 12, she indulges with the TV for hours then goes to lay out on a raft at the pool … I’m in shock because this was never my life,” she went on.“Justin’s family was all I knew for many years ... Things were different now and Jamie Lynn had a new Nickelodeon show … All I remember saying was “DAMN !!! How the hell does a 12 year old land a Nickelodeon show ????” she added.
 


“My Mamma was on pain medication and could barely hold a conversation in the house because her and my dad split and she was more messed up than anything !!!! I remember her sitting on the floor in a conversation and she never got up,” she added.

Until We Fall by Nicole Zelniker (Jaded Ibis Press)In the aftermath of a disastrous election that mirrors the 2016 political climate in the United States, things in this novel’s country take a turn for the worse, and civil war breaks out. At first, Isla, a Black and transgender high school student has no idea her teacher, Ms. Young, is part of the resistance; what Isla does know is that her own mother is no longer allowed to work outside of the home, even though she doesn’t fully understand why. She also knows what her older sister Hannah tells her, like that being trans was not always illegal. This dystopian novel addresses how a nation loses democracy, while tracking how people find solace in a landscape of violence and loss of civil rights under an increasingly authoritarian government. Gorgeously written, Zelniker pinpoints the power that societies have to incite change.A Country of Ghosts by Margaret Killjoy (Black Dawn)Dimos, a wartime journalist in a fictional world, finds himself embedded in a rebel unit that has murdered the commander he was sent to profile. It’s often hard going for Dimos, who has to prove that he will not betray the anarchists who have both captured him and show him mercy. While he does not — and is never asked to — specifically renounce imperialism, Dimos comes to see what the insurgents are fighting for: a utopian society. It’s far from perfect, but then again, perfection is not the goal, community is. “One day,” Dimos says, “I realized food given freely tasted objectively better than food taken by force.” A short novel with the arc of an epic, A Country of Ghosts is a story of people who will give up everything, including their own lives, to live in a better world.I’m Not Hungry But I Could Eat by Christopher Gonzalez (Santa Fe Writers Project)A party features a washing machine that performs miracles, like cleaning leather pants; happy hours take place where people love the booze but don’t want the snacks; and a man has a second lunch with a best friend directly after his first solo lunch is finished, because it’s a way of loving her. I’m Not Hungry But I Could Eat follows mostly bi male characters as they wind their way through NYC, sometimes dancing, and sometimes eating a bodega sandwich. In all of these fifteen stories, Gonzalez threads a needle that knits together food, bodies, sexuality, and identity in a way that is both potent and earnest. A debut that leaves readers wanting a third and second helping.Stop Me If You’ve Heard This One Before by Brandon Getz (Six Gallery Press)God and the Devil play chess, though God prefers Yahtzee. An alchemic being crawls out of an ill father’s head after he serrates his own neck with a knife; taking care of both her father and the being, a woman wishes they would both die. A man has the half-beginnings of an affair in a taxidermy shop while he worries for his daughters, one who needs glasses and the other a scoliosis brace, neither of which the taxidermist’s health insurance covers. In these 12 stories, Getz fully embraces characters who are desperate, strange, and often have absolutely no idea what to do next. In this way he creates a collection that is deeply weird but also strikingly human. Advertisement     Out Front the Following Sea by Leah Angstman (Regal House Press)In this historical novel set in 1600s colonial America, after a hard winter, Ruth, who has already been branded as an outsider, loses her grandmother. With nothing left to anchor her to her village, she barely escapes a mob, and bargains for a passage on a ship where her childhood friend, Owen, is the first mate. Ruth chafes against customs and propriety, neither of which have ever done much for her. In a new town, she is taken in by an older couple. What follows is a violent reckoning for Ruth, and at every turn, she struggles against convention — and her connection with Owen does not make anything easier. A new voice in historical fiction, Angstman confronts America’s embedded racism, sexism, and religious hypocrisy. Intensely researched, at its center Out Front the Following Sea is a love story, and a page-turner at that.The History of Man by Siphiwe Gloria Ndlovu (Catalyst Press)Emil is the son of colonialists in an unnamed Southern African country. After boarding school, he follows the path that has been set for him, becoming a civil servant. When war breaks out in the country, he is swept up in the urgency of it, only to find himself directionless when a ceasefire is announced. The second book from Ndlovu, which follows some of the same themes and characters from her debut Theory of Flight, is often affectionate toward Emil, even when he doesn’t deserve it. Marked by his parents' conflicted marriage and his own complicity in racist policy, Emil must ask himself what his old boarding school motto of “turning boys into men” really means. Both complicated and insightful, this book leaves readers wondering what is next for Ndlovu.When Me and God Were Little by Mads Nygaard, translated from the Dutch by Steve Schein (Dzanc Books, Jan. 18)When Karl Gustav’s older brother drowns, he is sent to live with his grandmother in the country, and by the time he returns, his father’s lucrative construction business has attracted the attention of the police. After a trial, his family is forced to move into subsidized housing in a new town, young Karl obsessively plays soccer and befriends a classmate with a heart condition. All the while, the loss of his sibling has left Karl angry in a way he cannot express, and while he is too young to really comprehend what has happened to his parents financially, he does understand that nothing will ever be the same. Told from the perspective of a child who is both struggling and confident, Nygaard captures the wonderment of experiencing everything from the dreadful to the joyful for the very first time. A moving book from an unforgettable voice.The Man With Eight Pairs of Legs by Leslie Kirk Campbell (Sarabande Books, Feb. 1)An abused woman is not allowed to leave her own house until she makes a deal with her terrible husband, a cheating man believes he will be ready to die once he beats his wife at a word game they’ve been playing for years, and a tall woman who has struggled with cutting falls in love with a runner who has lost his legs. In these eight stories, Campbell spins tales of isolation that range from the desperate to the profound, and her clear prose cuts through the trepidation her characters often feel. A meaningful and utterly devastating collection that cements Campbell as a leading short story writer. Advertisement     New Animal by Ella Baxter (Two Dollar Radio, Feb. 15)Amelia Aurelia is a trained embalmer who focuses on cosmetics, doing the hair and makeup of the dead at her family’s small funeral parlor. She has a talent for the work, and she seems happy enough, living in the gatehouse of her mother and step-father’s home, occupying her free time with app hookups. Yet, when her mother dies in a sudden accident, Amelia is plunged into a freefall, and she escapes to her biological dad’s house in Tasmania where she discovers the local BDSM scene. While this novel is peppered with scenes in kink clubs and the macabre of Amelia’s profession — and is also, in places obscenely funny — this is a story of a young woman who has to figure out how to live without her mother and has to also understand how her two dads will put aside their differences to hold her through the loss of the woman they both loved. There is fiction about grief and then there is Ella Baxter’s New Animal. Truly stunning.How to Date a Flying Mexican: New and Collected Stories by Daniel A. Olivas (University of Nevada Press, Feb. 22)In these selected stories that come from Olivas’s long publishing career, the magical realism, fairy tales, and sometimes dystopias that have often been a thread in his work are even more deeply underscored. Many of the characters are everyday people who have a special power (like the widower Tony who can sculpt anything from mud and make it come alive with a short spell), or who are visited by otherworldly guests (like Ysrael who is called on by a confused bureaucrat from Hell). Throughout all of his stories, there are strong Chicano characters, who embody tales that range from the laugh-out-loud funny to the heartbreaking. A timely retrospective from an important voice in Latinx literature.Border Less by Namatra Podder (7.13 Books, Feb. 27)In her airline call center job, Dia works against the clock to resolve passenger complaints within the allotted time. She’s running on very little sleep, working the night shift while she finishes her university degree and helping her family when her father’s cancer has returned. Dia dreams of completing an MBA in the US, even as she deals with rude and entitled Americans on the phone, and she does eventually make it to California. This novel also follows other women in an interconnected narrative — like fashion designers and multilevel marketing “Supperwear” sellers. What emerges is a story that is made whole through its fragmentation. A thoughtful exploration of what it means to belong.Little Foxes Took Up Matches by Katya Kazbek (Tin House Books, April 5)Set in Moscow after the collapse of the Soviet Union, this novel follows child and preteen Mitya as he traverses the turmoil of growing up. Alternating between the harsh realities of Mitya’s life — a sexually abusive cousin, the murder of his friend, rampant alcoholism — and the lush, parallel retelling of a fairytale with a traditional Slavic character, this novel is layered with questions about mortality and identity. It is a coming-of-age story that is at times chilling and in equal moments heartfelt, and at the center of it, Mitya is simply trying to find his own way. Kazbek writes with a kind of urgency that makes her novel a true standout. Every page sparks with energy in this ambitious and original debut. Advertisement     New to Liberty by DeMisty D. Bellinger (Unnamed Press, April 19)Told in three sections that work backward, starting in 1966 and ending 1933, this novel from DeMisty D. Bellinger unfolds the story of three interconnected women. Set mostly in Kansas, during and after the Dust Bowl and Great Depression, Sissily, Nella, and Greta must negotiate their way through their respective times. Present always is the threat of violence toward women, especially women of color. An assault by strangers in an auto shop, and assaults by a father and a boyfriend. Though set in the past, this book reads as contemporary, in a painful acknowledgment of how while a lot may have changed from 1933, in some ways, there’s not been so much change at all. Written with raw clarity, New to Liberty addresses race, gender, and anti-LGBTQ prejudice in a way that both face discrimination head-on and also blends the experiences of Bellinger’s characters seamlessly into the narrative. Watch for this book on every “best of” list for 2022.Singing Lessons for the Stylish Canary by Laura Stanfill (Lanternfish Press, April 19)For hundreds of years in the rainy village of Mireville, France, craftspeople make musical instruments and lace to export. When baby Georges is born to the Blanchards, the skies part, and Mireville is suddenly drenched with sun, with some consequences. Sent to America to deliver a serinette (a historical device used to train canaries to sing) from his father’s workshop to a wealthy client, teenaged Georges is seduced by the woman and hastily returns to France to marry his school crush, only later learning of her pregnancy. Later, Georges’s second son, Henri, must untangle how his village has such narrow expectations that men make music and women tat, and embarks on a journey to meet his half-brother in America. While the plot focuses on the legacies of sons, it is women’s friendships and alliances that hold this book together. Stanfill writes with such lightness that even the heaviest parts of this novel float. A charming debut.Constellations of Eve by Abbigail Nguyen Rosewood (Texas Tech University Press, May 3)Eve, a visual artist who struggles to see the worth in her own practice, feels forced to choose between two loves: her best friend and her boyfriend. Soon enough, the boyfriend becomes a husband and the father of their child. Yet, as Eve and her spouse become increasingly distant, she reconnects with her old friend, only to find there may be a link between the friend and the husband. Eve is haunted by her photographer mother’s ideas of beauty, and her mother’s cautions about being caught in the eye of the beholder or being the beholden. Eve is also often isolated in a rural home. In strikingly searing prose, Rosewood unfolds a compelling story of betrayal and obsession.I Only Cry With Emoticons by Yuvi Zalkow (Red Hen Press, June 7)In this comic but still tender novel, Saul is an awkward tech employee trying to understand his recent divorce, his relationship to fatherhood, his job, and his new girlfriend. Saul is mostly awful at all of the above, but his effort is endearing. Zalkow gives us a character who is nearly desperate in his need for approval, yet ultimately manages to look outside of his own obsessions and understand the love he has been seeking was there all along. The smartwatch interruptions with codebase errors for the app Saul has helped architect for his job rings true for anyone who has worked in tech, but either way, I Only Cry With Emoticons masterfully captures both the anxiety and hope of our modern lives. ● Advertisement

Workers who pack and ship boxes of food for HelloFresh in California voted against unionizing at the end of last year despite facing high rates of injury, low wages, and a major COVID-19 outbreak, a loss for the labor movement that reflects the ongoing challenges facing organizers two years into the pandemic.In summer 2020, a HelloFresh food-packing facility in Richmond, just north of Oakland, was the site of the largest COVID-19 outbreak in one of the state’s most populous counties, a wave that infected 171 workers at one warehouse. After an employee who worked at the facility died of COVID, state health and safety officials opened an investigation and in April 2021 charged the company with a “serious” violation. Advertisement     A labor union for the food and hospitality workers, UNITE HERE, started looking into working conditions at HelloFresh and published government data that showed rates of injury at the Richmond facility in 2020 were more than three times the average for the warehousing industry and almost twice as high as the average for workers in prepared food manufacturing.And workers faced those risks all while getting paid at an $18-an-hour rate that amounted to less than a living wage in the Bay Area, according to calculations by researchers at MIT.To organizers at UNITE HERE, the combination of those conditions made HelloFresh a prime target for unionizing — especially at a time when the risks of working through the pandemic seemed to have sparked a turning point in the American labor movement as workers demanded higher pay, pushed for safer working conditions, and walked out the door in record numbers. Strikes and walkouts doubled between fall 2020 and fall 2021, reported Bloomberg, which concluded that unions are “having a moment.” The Washington Post called this so-called strike wave “historic.” NBC deemed 2021 “the year of the worker.”But in November and December, HelloFresh workers in both Richmond, California, and Aurora, Colorado, voted decisively against the union — of 763 eligible workers in Richmond, 198 voted in favor of joining UNITE HERE, while 289 voted against, a similar spread to the results in Aurora. Advertisement     Even as public support for unions swelled and the labor movement gained momentum, actually persuading workers to form new unions remained a challenge.For some workers earning around $18 an hour in Richmond, the prospect of union dues cutting into their already tight budgets was enough to turn them against the initiative.“If we applied for the union, they’re going to take our extra money,” HelloFresh employee Candy Hatcher said, referring to the dues employees would pay if the union won. “I have bills. I have rent and everything,”
 


The number of successful union campaigns dropped following the start of the pandemic, both because it limited face-to-face organizing and because the agency paused elections during the early months of the outbreak. In 2020, 577 unions were certified and 661 in 2021, down from 901 in 2019 and 1,076 in 2015, according to data collected by Miami University assistant professor of political science Kevin Reuning. The trend predates the pandemic: In the last six years, the total number of newly unionized workers has plummeted — from 53,765 in 2015 to ​​45,189 in 2019 to 31,445 in 2021 — while the percentage of elections that unions win has hovered consistently around 50%.The recent setbacks for labor organizers reflect the difficulty of convincing workers who are paid low wages and have minimal employment protections that the benefits of collective bargaining are worth the financial costs and the risks of losing employment at companies aggressively pushing against unionizing.“It’s hard for all workers to organize, but it’s especially hard for the more vulnerable workers to organize,” said Rebecca Givan, a labor studies professor at Rutgers. “Campaigns of intimidation can be very successful because these workers know that they are living a precarious life. It really helps employers take advantage of employees when the employees feel fortunate to have a job instead of feeling they have a right to demand more.”
 


At HelloFresh, which is what’s called a “second-chance employer,” some employees have criminal convictions on their records, which bars them from a range of other jobs, including driving for Lyft or Uber. Others are immigrants with limited English-speaking skills. All face one of the most severe housing shortages in the country; a quarter of Bay Area residents don’t make enough money to make ends meet.Like many companies, HelloFresh maintained a website that discouraged workers from voting for the union. The website, My HelloFresh Voice, told workers they could be “permanently replaced” if they went on strike, and it included a calculator that showed how much they could earn if they invested their dues rather than paying the union $59.60 per month.The vote against the union at the HelloFresh facilities in some ways mirrors the ongoing high-profile union election at an Amazon facility in Bessemer, Alabama; following a decisive loss, both unions charged the employer with illegally interfering in the election process. While workers at Amazon succeeded in that effort and will begin voting by mail in a rerun of the election on Feb. 4, workers at HelloFresh await an investigation by federal labor regulators into their objection to the election results in Colorado and charges of unfair labor practice in California.Workers who supported the union had “wanted HelloFresh to finally listen to their concerns about disrespect, dangerous working conditions, and pay,” a spokesperson for the union said in a statement immediately following the election, “but instead HelloFresh spent thousands of dollars a day on an aggressive anti-union campaign.”In a statement, the company said that the election had made it “resoundingly clear” that employees “trust in HelloFresh to work in their best interest.” The company denied that it had interfered illegally with the union election process and said the goal of the union website was to “create an open dialogue with our employees, enabling them to make informed decisions” about unionizing. HelloFresh said it took steps to improve safety measures in 2021 and reduced its injury rate to below the industry average. “Employees are at the heart of everything we do, and we prioritize their health, safety and wellbeing above all else,” the statement said. Advertisement     While there are laws against intimidating and threatening employees who want to unionize, enforcement mechanisms are weak and consequences for employers are limited, said Lola Loustaunau, a University of Oregon sociologist who in 2020 published research on why workers vote against unions.“It benefits them to violate labor law,” she said of employers generally. “They could fire you, and you can file a fair labor practice claim later, but what does that do for a person who needs their paycheck this week?”
 


As Bay Area COVID-19 cases climbed to new highs in summer 2020, Contra Costa County health officials noticed that one employer “kept coming up,” according to workplace health and safety documents: HelloFresh.When health inspector Heather Cedermaz went out to investigate the Richmond facility on July 20, 2020, the company said it had 26 recorded coronavirus cases in its workplace, but county records showed at least 54 cases among HelloFresh employees in that facility. While she found HelloFresh cooperative, she wasn’t satisfied with its COVID protocols, she later told California workplace safety officials. People were grouped by doorways and eating together in a crowded break room, the plexiglass barriers meant to reduce exposure between people working side by side were hung too high to be effective, and employees weren’t properly wearing their masks. Documents show that in official mitigation strategies sent to HelloFresh, the public health department recommended the company take “immediate actions,” including reducing the on-site workforce by 40% by July 22, 2020, and testing all employees by July 29.By then, Wilfredo Alvarez, a 64-year-old HelloFresh employee who’d been working on the production line in Richmond for three years, had been hospitalized with COVID-19 for over a week. His children kept in touch with their dad’s employer, according to text messages included in documents provided to BuzzFeed News by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The family updated company human resources representatives on which hospital he was in and kept them abreast of his condition. William, one of Alvarez’s sons, told state health and safety officials that he had also informed the company of his dad’s positive COVID-19 diagnosis, and text messages show he told them when he also contracted the virus himself and had to quarantine. Advertisement     “Dad is stable but still in critical conditions,” William texted a HelloFresh HR representative on July 21. “But slowly he’s getting better.”After Alvarez had come to San Francisco from Nicaragua, he first worked as a salesperson, pitching farm equipment to agricultural workers throughout the region, before eventually ending up at HelloFresh, one of his sons, Wilfredo Jr., told BuzzFeed News. Even into his 60s, Alvarez was active, jumping rope with his grandkids at a birthday party in early July. Though he was nearing retirement age, he had no plans to stop working. The youngest of his 12 children was 12 years old, and he wanted to keep earning to support his kids’ education.Wilfredo Jr. said that his dad was careful about COVID-19 and rarely went anywhere else besides work. “He always took care of his health,” he said. “When this whole COVID thing started, even to come see us and spend time with us, he would come wearing his gloves and mask the whole time.”But his precautions weren’t enough to ward off the virus. On July 9, Alvarez, who had never been tested for COVID-19 at work, called out sick, telling his employer that his symptoms must be a result of his diabetes acting up. Less than a week later, he tested positive for COVID and was admitted to the hospital.In an email exchange reviewed by BuzzFeed News, HelloFresh’s US head of corporate safety and security, Mitchell Jacobs, told state officials that, according to information provided to him by human resources, after Alvarez was hospitalized, the company didn’t hear about his condition again until the county health department called to inform the company of Alvarez’s death. But text message records show that, on July 29, one of Alvarez’s sons texted a HelloFresh representative about his dad’s condition, saying, “I’m still hoping for a miracle and hoping for the best but I'm looking for funeral homes already.” Later that night, Alvarez died, alone in the intensive care unit of a hospital in Vacaville, California.“My dad didn’t make it,” Alvarez’s son told a HelloFresh employee via text message.“Oh my goodness. No I’m so so sorry. I’m so sorry,” the HelloFresh employee responded.Cedermaz heard about Alvarez’s death from the hospital and instructed the company to report the fatality to the state, which it did, 12 days after his death. The accident report stated that HelloFresh was “unsure of the cause of death” and had “no knowledge as to if [Alvarez] was positive for COVID-19 or not.” Advertisement     In a statement to BuzzFeed News, the company said that “HelloFresh has at all times fully met its reporting obligations in a timely manner, and has at all times followed our voluntary and industry-leading operating procedure when we have been made aware of self-reported incidents of COVID-19 among our team, including multi-level contact tracing and quarantine.”The day after the report of Alvarez’s death was filed, state health inspectors came to the Richmond facility to inspect the company’s COVID-19 protocols. There, they encountered many of the same issues the county’s investigator had found three weeks before: Employees were grouped too close together, some handwashing stations had no water, and while there were ""barriers between production line workers,"" the partitions were located ""above their heads!""Health and safety officials continued working with HelloFresh, which in September informed them that its director of safety and security, Craig Gage, had “left the position” and was being replaced by newly hired Mitchell Jacobs. On Sept. 22, Jacobs took a state official on another facility tour in which they encountered one worker “without a face covering,” a second “without a face covering placed over his mouth and nose,” a third “not wearing their face covering,” and a fourth “without a face covering in place,” according to state health and safety documents. Gage didn’t respond to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News; HelloFresh did not respond to questions regarding his departure from the company.
 


Lontrell Bolton, who was working for HelloFresh that summer, said he felt as though the company “didn’t really care” about whether employees were getting sick or bringing the virus to work. He remembered thinking it was strange that employees were allowed to sit together at lunch inside with their masks off.“The outbreak was there a long time, but nobody really said anything,” Bolton told BuzzFeed News. The priority, he said, was keeping the facility open, not keeping the virus out.“All you had to do to get in is say you haven't been tested and you could get in,"" he said.By the time the state health and safety agency completed its investigation, it agreed that HelloFresh hadn’t done enough to protect its staff from the worst of the pandemic. The agency was not able to conclusively determine whether Alvarez contracted the virus at work, on April 5, 2021. But it concluded that the company had failed to keep workers appropriately distanced, provide barriers, and enforce mask rules; officials charged the company with one moderate and one serious health and safety violation and fined it $8,995.In a statement, HelloFresh said it worked quickly to roll out COVID-19 safety procedures, including “increased sick pay, daily hospital-grade deep cleanings, mask mandates, strict social distancing, upgraded air filtration systems, and paid time off for quarantines.”The company has not paid the fine but said it is in “close conversations with CalOSHA pertaining to the ongoing citation and [looks] forward to reaching a final resolution once the investigation is complete.” The company said it was “deeply saddened to learn of Mr. Alvarez's passing” but “unable to link this incident to work-related exposure.”The Alvarez family believes their dad contracted the virus at work — but because HelloFresh wasn’t testing employees daily, there’s no way to know. “They should have done their contact tracing,” Wilfredo Jr. said. “If they have to shut down until they figured things out, they should have done that.”Almost a year and a half after Alvarez died, his family is still waiting to have a funeral. He wanted to be buried in Nicaragua, but the expense of flying the whole family down, plus the cost of complying with local COVID testing protocols, is still too high. Meanwhile, his older children have had to support their youngest siblings in addition to their own kids, who still get emotional when they think about their grandfather, Wilfredo Jr. said.“The last conversation I had with him, he told my kids, ‘I’ll see you guys soon, I’m fine!’ Which we knew he wasn’t, but he wasn’t going to tell my kids that,” he said. “He wasn’t done. He wanted to live.”
 


Rusty Barnes, a HelloFresh employee for four years, lived across the street from Wilfredo Alvarez, not far from the facility where they both worked. From the moment Barnes, 55, first heard that a union might come to HelloFresh through a coworker on his team in the shipping department in fall 2021, he was on board. “That company is a joke,” he said. “They needed to go union.”Even without a global pandemic, working in a warehouse where large pallets of food are being stored, moved, broken down, and repacked into smaller boxes to be shipped to homes across the country can be a physically taxing job. Workers reported injuries in every month of 2020 — including wrist strains from lifting, bruises from tripping over onions, contusions from having a “foot ran over by the pallet jack,” and the “crushing of multiple lower extremities” by “parts and materials on top of a rack,” according to state health and safety documents. In September, an employee strained her neck after “another employee fell on top of [her] and knocked her to the ground.” According to UNITE HERE, workers at HelloFresh’s Richmond facility in 2020 were injured 4.8 times as frequently as the average worker in private industry. The company said it reduced its injury rate in 2021.Barnes said it’s easy to trip over loose pieces of wood or pallet straps on the floor in the shipping area where he works. He doesn’t mind the physical nature of the work, he said, but he believes his experience and expertise should earn him a higher wage than what production line workers make. He lives with his 81-year-old mother and drives her car to work because he can’t afford to fix his truck; his main reason for supporting the union was financial.“I stack boxes on pallets, and I don’t think anyone else has ever did it for as long as I’ve been doing it, and I still make just as much as the guy that’s been there for a year,” he said. “I don’t feel it's right.”Barnes said the company’s response to the union was aggressive. “They were passing out beanies saying ‘Vote no.’ They were giving out masks that said ‘Vote no.’ They had signs all over the wall everywhere that said ‘Vote no.’ And they kept taking people into meetings almost every day.” According to unfair labor practice charges later filed by the union, the company wasn't just ""distributing anti-union masks and hats to employees"" but ""requiring employees to wear them."" The charges didn’t specify how the company enforced that requirement. Barnes said he didn’t wear the hat, and that he taped a pro-union message onto this safety vest. UNITE HERE didn’t respond to questions about the charges it filed.Supporters tried to keep the union organizing secret from management, Barnes said. But by the time they publicly announced the campaign and filed for an election on Sept. 23, the company had already hired an anti-union firm that cost $3,500 per day per consultant to work in California and Colorado, according to HuffPost. After that, the company tried multiple strategies to curtail enthusiasm for the union. HelloFresh tech workers who asked questions about the working conditions their colleagues in the processing facilities were experiencing were ignored or shut down by management, Vice reported.In October, the union filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board accusing HelloFresh of violating labor law. Workers said the company had illegally intimidated employees in Richmond who vocally supported the union by denying them access to the restroom, preventing them from receiving lunch, demoting them, and sending them home from work without pay. The union also accused the company of prohibiting employees from distributing union pamphlets, a legally protected activity, and “using physical force against employees,” the charge stated.HelloFresh said it plans to refute the charges of unfair labor practices but declined to comment further on an “ongoing investigation.”Ballots started going out to HelloFresh workers in Richmond on Nov. 18. On Nov. 23, UNITE HERE learned it had lost the election at HelloFresh in Aurora. Meanwhile, two workers in California told a local news outlet funded by Chevron that the labor union only wanted to collect dues and was exaggerating health and safety issues to scare them. On Dec. 15, the votes came in — the union had lost.UNITE HERE contested the results of the election in Colorado, but not the one in Richmond, although the union did file additional unfair labor practice charges in early January, accusing HelloFresh management of ""making a rule against displaying union insignia,"" promising raises after the election ended, and enforcing certain rules only against employees who supported the union, among other charges.“We are determined to hold HelloFresh accountable for its brazen and disgusting anti-union tactics,” spokesperson Ted Waechter said in a statement immediately following the election.In Bessemer, Alabama, Amazon workers won a do-over election because a regional director for the NLRB found that the corporation had broken the law; the second round of voting will begin on Feb. 4 and votes will be counted on March 28, a year and four months after the union first filed for election. Givan, the Rutgers professor, warned that the rerun process is “long, it’s expensive, and it’s really, really difficult.” Workers at a Smithfield Foods plant eventually won a rerun election in 2008, Givan said, but it took three tries and 16 total years.At the time the union lost the Amazon election in Alabama at the beginning of 2021, many union leaders and labor scholars spoke about the need for Congress to pass the Protect the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would have prohibited employers from mandating attendance at anti-union meetings and introduced monetary penalties for companies that broke the law. But one year later, those policies still haven’t become law, though Congress continues to negotiate the $2 trillion Build Back Better bill, which contains some elements of the PRO Act.Today, labor leaders have shifted their hopes to President Joe Biden’s appointee for NLRB general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, who has said she plans to use her power to more forcefully police employers. A recent settlement gave the NLRB more power to punish Amazon, as the New York Times first reported.For the moment, though, worker protections remain unchanged, leaving people who “are already pretty low-wage workers in pretty hazardous conditions, barely making ends meet, being confronted with the possibility of losing what little they have,” the University of Oregon’s Loustaunau said.Rusty Barnes, the shipping worker, said HelloFresh ran “a nasty anti-union campaign” that, for now, has succeeded. “They scared a lot of people to vote no,” he said.During the election, he and other employees received a text message from HelloFresh about a wage raise, which he believed meant a retroactive $1-an-hour pay increase when the election was over. “It would make a lot of difference,” said Barnes, who makes $18.86 an hour and planned to put the money toward repairing his truck. But so far, the raise hasn’t appeared, and when he brought it up with HR, he said, a representative told him he already makes the maximum rate for his position.HelloFresh said it did raise its national minimum wage after the union election ended, but that how the raise impacted employees depended on where in the country they worked; employees with questions should ""reach out to their local human resources team,"" a spokesperson said.Barnes said he wants to help the union keep fighting at HelloFresh, but he’s also thinking about finding another job.“I got bills just like everybody else,” he said. “All they care about is getting their boxes out.” ●

André Leon Talley, a pioneering fashion journalist and American Vogue’s first Black creative director, has died in New York at the age of 73.The announcement of Talley’s death was posted on his Instagram but did not detail the cause of death.“Over the past five decades as an international icon [he] was a close confidant of Yves Saint Laurent, Karl Lagerfeld, Paloma Picasso, Diane von Furstenberg, Bethann Hardison, Manolo Blahnik and he had a penchant for discovering, nurturing and celebrating young designers,” the statement said. Advertisement     
 


His illustrious career, which began in 1974, saw him work across various publications before entering Vogue in 1983, which would lead to his defining role as the creative director from 1988 to 1995, making him the first African American man to hold the position.A trailblazing figure in fashion journalism, Talley is credited as a pivotal figure in Vogue’s ascension to fashion bible status.
 


Talley became an icon in his own right, known for his “larger-than-life” personality to compliment his 6-foot-7-inch frame — which he often draped with decadent capes, robes, and kaftans.His death has prompted an outpouring of tributes from friends, peers, and those who admired him in various social circles.
 


Designer Diane von Furstenberg wrote: “No one saw the world in a more elegant and glamorous way than you did, no one was more soulful and grander than you were, the world will be less joyful now. I have loved you and laughed with you for 45 years…. I will miss your loud screams and your loyal friendship…I love you soooo much.” Advertisement     
 


“R.I.P dearest Andre. Without you, there would be no me. Thank you for paving the way,” wrote British Vogue editor Edward Enninful, who is the first Black person to head up the UK edition of the magazine.On Wednesday morning, Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who'd had a turbulent relationship with Talley for years (he left the magazine after their reported fallout) spoke of his joy of fashion and their friendship.“The loss of André is felt by so many of us today: the designers he enthusiastically cheered on every season, and who loved him for it; the generations he inspired to work in the industry, seeing a figure who broke boundaries while never forgetting where he started from; those who knew fashion, and Vogue, simply because of him; and, not forgetting, the multitude of colleagues over the years who were consistently buoyed by every new discovery of André’s, which he would discuss loudly, and volubly—no one could make people more excited about the most seemingly insignificant fashion details than him,"" she said in a statement published in Vogue. “Yet it’s the loss of André as my colleague and friend that I think of now; it’s immeasurable. He was magnificent and erudite and wickedly funny—mercurial, too. Like many decades-long relationships, there were complicated moments, but all I want to remember today, all I care about, is the brilliant and compassionate man who was a generous and loving friend to me and to my family for many, many years, and who we will all miss so much.”Supermodel and actor Milla Jovovich expressed her shock at the news before going on to describe Talley as one of the “most genuinely wonderful humans” she had ever met.The Resident Evil star said she had felt particularly lucky to have experienced Talley’s kindness “because good people are few and far between in this business.""
 


Director Ava DuVernay noted her own experience of Talley’s kindness and long-standing support by recalling his attendance at a launch for her popular series Queen Sugar.“He came to support and to cheer me on after all the years that had passed,"" she wrote. ""He was lavish and loving. I’ll remember him fondly.”His memoir, The Chiffon Trenches, published in 2020, detailed his growth to the highest echelons of fashion and what it was like to work in institutions entrenched in white supremacy.“The tower of strength of my Blackness is my body of knowledge in memory and in experience, and therefore I am unique,” he said in a 2020 interview with W magazine. “When you speak of me, you must speak about my talents and knowledge, and that I also shared that knowledge and experiences of my education through the fashion world.”

51,The Biden administration is finally sending Americans free at-home COVID tests. Here’s how you can get one.,"


The Biden administration announced Friday that it will double its supply of coronavirus rapid tests to a total of 1 billion and make those tests freely available online for every American household.Beginning Jan. 18, Americans can visit COVIDtests.gov to order up to four rapid tests per household (officials originally said ordering would be available Jan.19, but instead it went live a day early).The move comes as the US struggles with soaring COVID-19 cases caused chiefly by the Omicron variant, which has smashed case count and hospitalization records nationwide.Tests will be free. The only information required for purchase is a name and mailing address. But officials estimated that the tests would not ship until 7–12 days after purchase, meaning the soonest they could arrive in homes is Jan. 26. Advertisement     In early December, the Biden administration unveiled a winter strategy for the Omicron variant, focusing on more people getting boosters, more vaccinations for school-age kids, as well as requirements for private insurers to pay for at-home tests. Later in the month, Biden announced plans to open 20,000 free testing sites and to send federal medical teams to assist overloaded hospitals, which are now being deployed.But the requirement for private insurers to cover at-home tests does not go into effect until Jan. 15, meaning it has not helped pay for rapid tests during the holiday Omicron surge. The administration also came under fire as at-home test supplies ran short on pharmacy shelves over the holidays as Omicron cases skyrocketed. This led to the first plans to make 500 million free tests available to Americans, followed by Friday’s doubling of that figure.Nam Tran, a professor of clinical pathology at the University of California, Davis, said he welcomed Friday’s announcement and noted that any expansion of testing is good news, but he cautioned that people need to remember how to test appropriately. “We shouldn't be just testing out of overall anxiety concern, we should be testing for good reasons,” he said.According to the CDC, rapid tests should be used if you have COVID symptoms, if you’ve been in close contact with someone who has COVID, or if you will be gathering indoors with someone who is either at high risk for severe disease or is unvaccinated.But if you’re asymptomatic, Tran said, it’s critical to test more than once, at least 36 hours apart. “Testing multiple times, over time, allows you to catch the virus when it reaches that level that becomes detectable,” he said. This means the four tests per household would only be enough to get a meaningful result for two asymptomatic people. In symptomatic individuals, Tran said, the viral load is likely high enough that one test should be sufficient to tell if that person is infectious.

52,Scream is back — and it's already a huge success.,"The much-anticipated return of Ghostface has already been a huge success, with Scream swiping the top spot at the box office from Marvel juggernaut No Way Home. The legendary slasher franchise returned to screens for the first time in more than a decade and has almost immediately earned more domestically than its predecessor's entire theatrical run. Critics and fans alike have already lauded the return of the franchise, with Scream receiving some of its highest scores to date on Rotten Tomatoes. With a strong outing in its first weekend, Scream was able to topple No Way Home from its perch, after the Marvel movie had dominated the box office since December. With the early success of Scream, there's already talk amongst fans that further sequels could be in the works, particularly as there were reportedly plans for a follow-up to Scream 4 that were shelved following its poor performance. And it seems that the clear appetite for the genre could see a revival for slasher movies in general, with producer Jason Blum hinting at several potential projects. But another important win for Scream is its success in the face of the ongoing pandemic, which has seen many movies bomb at the box office as audiences continue to be hesitant about returning to theaters in the face of surging COVID-19 cases."
53,The breakout star of Netflix’s viral dating program Single’s Inferno has admitted to wearing counterfeit designer items on the show.,"


Song Ji-a, the breakout star of Netflix’s viral dating program Single’s Inferno known for her glamorous style, has admitted to wearing counterfeit designer items on the reality show.“I sincerely apologize to everyone who was disappointed and hurt because of me,” she stated in a handwritten note that was posted Monday on Instagram.YouTuber and influencer Song, who is known as Freezia online, has a materialistic social media persona that focuses on high-end fashion and lifestyle content. She’s part of the “geumsujeo,” or “golden spoon,” culture, which refers to a person born into the top 0.1% of the South Korean population in terms of wealth. Advertisement     
 


After the release of Single’s Inferno, fans began discussing on forums whether some of the clothes Song wore on the show — a knit Chanel logo top (estimated $2,400), a Marine Serre–style dress ($1,100), a pink Dior logo top ($600), and Van Cleef & Arpels earrings ($7,500) — featured small discrepancies in color, density, and pattern compared to the authentic items.Then Song confirmed the rumors with her Instagram post.
 


“I apologize once again for all the circumstances that have occurred due to infringing on designers’ creations and ignorance of copyrights,” she wrote. “As someone who has a dream of launching a brand, I will seriously recognize and reflect on the controversial parts.”Fans have been divided in their response, with the overwhelming majority of Korean-language users maintaining that they felt deceived and misled. “It’s not okay to buy fake items themselves… most counterfeit sellers are involved with criminal organizations,” one fan complained. “You did something like this just to boost your self-esteem,” wrote another. “Single’s Inferno is broadcast all over the world.”That anger stems in part from a large cultural difference, says Courtney Park, 25, a Korean American social media agency owner who posted one of the first translations of Song’s apology and explained the situation on TikTok. Advertisement     “South Korea has an overwhelmingly conservative culture, and the idea of lying to people is very much cause for outrage — in addition to supporting the counterfeit industry,” Park told BuzzFeed News. Plus the culture is highly image conscious. “It’s not unusual to go to a department store here in leggings after the gym, but if you were to do that in Korea, it would certainly affect how much service or attention you receive in the stores,” Park said.
 


Song carefully cultivated that material-based influencer image, both on social media and in Single’s Inferno. “She was the most ‘bling-bling’ and fabulous,” contestant Moon Se-hoon said in the first episode.Comments in English, and larger international responses online, have skewed more in support of the thrifty queen. “Wtf didn’t know people had to apologize for that,” said one user under the same Instagram apology.
 


Park said she’s not surprised at how split the reactions have been, divided down the middle by language.“There is a bigger emphasis on where you shop versus how you look for Korean content creators,” Park said.One of the larger topics of conversation among those in support of Song is that fashion has long been an exclusionary and prohibitive industry, both in terms of knowledge and financial access.Charles Gross, 26, a longtime luxury reseller and renowned fashion influencer on TikTok, agrees but says there are consequences for those in the public eye. “There are both social implications and ethical implications behind wearing counterfeit items on platforms like television,” Gross said. “The value in owning an authentic item is that, ethically speaking, you are paying for creative intellectual property, as well as for the skill and artistry,” he added, noting that it may impact Song’s ability to get brand deals later on in her career. Advertisement     
 


Park says the biggest loss overall is the destruction of Song Ji-a’s “young, rich and successful” brand. “I think it’s funny that some of the Korean comments I’ve read are concerned about how the houses, like Chanel and Dior, will feel. Really, I don’t think we should be worrying about them,” she said. “The controversy is more about culture than the clothes. For Ji-a, her allure wasn’t ever dependent on her clothes. But the clothes certainly helped.”

54,Having active-shooter training and other preparedness measures are increasingly significant for the Jewish community.,"


The armed man who held four people hostage inside Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas, on Saturday was first welcomed as a “guest” into the synagogue by the rabbi, who offered him tea on what was a cold day in North Texas.It once again raised the question of how rabbis can be welcoming religious leaders as threats against synagogues have loomed since the 2018 mass shooting at the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh. After a more than 11-hour standoff, three of the hostages inside the synagogue managed to escape (the fourth was released earlier), in large part because the congregation had participated in an active shooter training, according to accounts from the rabbi and another man who was held hostage. Advertisement     “First of all, we escaped,” one of the four hostages, Jeffrey Cohen, wrote in a Facebook post on Monday morning. “We weren't released or freed. We escaped because we had training from the Secure Community Network on what to do in the event of an active shooter. This training saved our lives -- I am not speaking in hyperbole here -- it saved our lives.”The Secure Community Network, a nonprofit organization that provided Congregation Beth Israel with its safety training last August, has seen a demand for these training sessions. The organization has trained more than 17,000 people in the North American Jewish community in the past year, Michael Masters, the CEO and national director of Secure Community Network, told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday. The congregation had also received training from the Anti-Defamation League and the Colleyville Police Department.“This isn’t the world that we chose, it’s the world that we have and it’s the reality of that world that we need to train for events like we saw on Saturday,” Masters said.Congregation Beth Israel Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker told CBS News on Monday that he was at the synagogue before Shabbat services when a man knocked on the synagogue’s window. The rabbi said he let the man in and made him tea, thinking he needed shelter on what was a cold day for North Texas. Advertisement     
 


“Making tea was an opportunity for me to talk with him and in that moment, I didn’t hear anything suspicious,” Cytron-Walker said.In his Facebook posts, Cohen said that when he arrived at the synagogue for Saturday morning prayer, the rabbi introduced him to a “guest” who appeared “calm and happy.”“His eyes weren't darting around; his hands were open and calm, he said hello, he smiled,” Cohen said of the stranger.But when the service commenced, the rabbi turned his back during prayer and said he heard a “click” — the sound turned out to be the man’s gun. The armed stranger then ranted and yelled commands at the hostages, who feared for their lives in their place of worship.“As a part of training of clergy, we talk a lot about being a calm non-anxious presence,” Cytron-Walker told CBS. “[The trainings] really teach you in those moments that when your life is threatened you need to do whatever you can to get to safety.”Having active-shooter training and other preparedness measures are increasingly significant for the Jewish community, but their presence is a challenge to the very tenants of the faith, which promotes welcoming a guest.The reminder to welcome strangers is repeated 36 times, more than any other commandment in the Torah, the Jewish book of faith, Masters said.But the role of rabbis to receive guests is challenged by the necessity of keeping a congregation safe, as antisemitic acts of assault, vandalism, and harassment have increased by 12% over the previous year, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Advertisement     “We do not want our facilities to look like armed fortresses,” Masters said, adding that balancing open-door principles with safety measures is “essential.”There’s no “one size fits all” solution, he said, and the right strategy for every congregation must involve working with rabbis to develop comprehensive strategies that go beyond just an armed guard or a security camera.“I’m alive today because I took that training,” Rabbi Hazzan Jeffrey Myers, a survivor of the mass shooting that killed 11 people at the Tree of Life Congregation in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh in 2018, told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday.
 


Prior to the massacre, Myers took multiple training sessions in the months offered by the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, which taught him specific safety tactics, such as bringing his phone with him into service. Because of this lesson, Myers was able to make the first 911 call on Oct. 27, 2018, when an armed assailant entered the synagogue with an AR-15-style assault rifle and multiple handguns.“That’s an indictment of America that the Jewish community in the United States has to take these steps,” Myers said, adding that it’s not only the Jewish community gripped by the threat of violence. He said he fears for every house of worship, where attacks are on the rise.It is “foolish” for other religious houses not to engage in active shooter training, Myers said.“There is no choice,” he said, adding that it's essential to “internalize” the training.The “big question,” Myers said, was how does one remember the lesson to be empathetic to a stranger when that stranger “is armed and ready to kill you?”“That leads to a bigger question of what is going on in America that our houses of worship are under attack and our concept of sanctuary … has now been compromised,"" he said.In his Facebook post recounting the escape from the attacker, Cohen said the situation in the synagogue did not play out “like the movies.” The armed man threatened the congregation in an 11-hour long standoff that started around 11 a.m. Advertisement     The Dallas FBI identified the gunman as a 44-year-old British man named Malik Faisal Akram, who is believed to have acted alone.One of the four hostages was released around 5 p.m., but as the standoff dragged on, Akram began growing more agitated, yelling that he was going to kill the remaining hostages, Cohen said.Small decisions made for a big difference for the hostages, according to Cohen’s account. He said he always keeps his phone next to him during services, so he was able to quickly call 911 when the gunman began yelling and put the phone screen side down as he moved when commanded.“Instead of going to the back of the room, I stayed in line with one of the exits,” Cohen said in his Facebook post, adding that he remained calm during the standoff and never raised his voice or made sudden moves.Cohen said the hostages talked to the gunman and asked him questions to keep him “engaged,” buying the FBI time.Cohen then recalled how he helped a fellow hostage move closer to the exit by whispering to him about the exit door while rubbing his shoulders. When a pizza was delivered to the hostages, Cohen suggested that the third hostage bring it back to them, eventually positioning all three hostages within 20 feet of the exit.“This proved critical for our escape,” Cohen said.At one point the gunman let the hostages call their families, so Cohen spoke with his wife, daughter, and son, and posted on Facebook.“To be perfectly honest, at that point, I figured we had few options and little chance of survival,” Cohen wrote. “With my feet, I slowly moved a few chairs in front of me. Anything to slow or divert a bullet or shrapnel.”He said the situation began to worsen when the gunman ordered the hostages to get on their knees.“The last hour or so of the standoff, he wasn’t getting what he wanted … It didn’t look good,” Cytron-Walker told CBS.The rabbi said he waited until the right moment before hauling a chair at the gunman and yelling for the hostages to run. The three hostages escaped out a side door without any shots being fired at them. Advertisement     They were escorted to safety when FBI agents entered the synagogue around 9 p.m. on Saturday. The gunman died in a “shooting incident,” although it was not immediately clear whether agents or the suspect himself fired the shot that killed him.“It was terrifying,” Cytron-Walker said. “We’re still processing.”
 


Akram, who flew to the US from London on Dec. 29, allegedly demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a neuroscientist who was convicted of attempting to kill US soldiers and FBI agents and is currently serving an 86-year sentence at a federal prison near Fort Worth, Texas. The Greater Manchester Police in the UK said two teenagers were in custody for questioning in connection with the incident, but they were released on Tuesday without being charged.“We do believe from our engagement with this subject that he was singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community, but we will continue to work to find motive,” FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said in a press conference Saturday.The Secure Community Network is conducting an analysis on the Colleyville attack for potential takeaways, and the group updated its guidance as of Tuesday morning for its new BeAware training. Masters said the team modified the training Tuesday morning with principles on identifying suspicious behavior, specifically a reminder that appearances can be deceiving — after Cohen recalled that the gunman appeared “happy” and “calm” in the synagogue, despite his intentions.“This is not security theater,” Masters said, adding that keeping faith-based organizations safe isn’t a part-time effort.Masters encouraged Jewish communities across the nation to “commit to action,” get trained, and have a facility assessment done to determine security weakpoints.“You do what you have to do,” Cytron-Walker said, adding that it was “important” the congregation goes back to the facility at some point. “I did the best I could to do that throughout the standoff.” Advertisement

55,The House committee investigating the Capitol riots is issuing a new batch of subpoenas to four of Donald Trump’s closest allies.,"


WASHINGTON – The House committee investigating the Capitol riots is issuing a new batch of subpoenas to four of Donald Trump’s closest allies in his failed legal fight to overturn the 2020 election: Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, Sidney Powell, and Boris Epshteyn.“The Select Committee is looking into the causes that contributed to the violence on January 6th, including attempts to promote unsupported claims of election fraud and pressure campaigns to overturn the 2020 election results,” Chair Bennie Thompson said in a statement announcing the move. Advertisement     The committee explicitly said the four “advanced unsupported theories about election fraud, pushed efforts to overturn the election results, or were in direct contact with the former President about attempts to stop the counting of electoral votes.” Committee members are looking for interviews with the four as well as documents related to their work around the 2020 election.That was not the only news out of the committee on Tuesday: It has also subpoenaed and obtained call data records from the former president's son Eric Trump and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is in a relationship with Donald Trump, Jr. That step was first reported Tuesday by CNN, and confirmed by a committee member.In its letters to Giuliani, Ellis, Powell, and Epshteyn, the committee said it had “revealed credible evidence” that they had “publicly promoted claims that the 2020 election was stolen and participated in attempts to disrupt or delay the certification of the election results.” Some of that advocacy for false election conspiracy theories was not especially secret: Members of the group held multiple press conferences in 2020 advancing the idea.The committee also said in its letter to Giuliani that the former mayor was reportedly in contact with members of Congress and Trump about strategies of overturning the 2020 election that Trump lost.In its letter to Ellis, a former Trump 2020 campaign legal adviser, the committee took interest in two memos she prepared and circulated claiming to analyze the authority for then–vice president Mike Pence to reject or delay the Electoral College vote even though Pence did not have the authority to do so. Advertisement     Powell, who has been involved in several lawsuits related to claims of fraud and has been ridiculed for it in court, was subpoenaed under similar terms, with the committee also seeking information on her reportedly urging Trump to seize voting machines.The committee is also investigating whether there was a coordinated effort to promote election falsehoods in the days before Jan. 6 among a group of strategists, including Epshteyn, at the Willard Hotel. The committee is also looking into a Jan 6. phone call it says Epshteyn had with Trump to discuss alternatives in the event Pence declined to delay the certification of the 2020 election.“It is no surprise whatsoever that the illegitimate January 6th Unselect Committee would attempt to subpoena attorneys as it continues its Stalinist witch hunt against President Trump and his supporters,” Epshteyn said in a statement.So far, some Trump allies have resisted complying with the committee’s subpoenas. Two — former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former political adviser Steve Bannon — were found in contempt of Congress for it; Bannon was later indicted.

56,"Americans can visit COVIDtests.gov to order up to four rapid tests per household, starting now.","


The Biden administration announced Friday that it will double its supply of coronavirus rapid tests to a total of 1 billion and make those tests freely available online for every American household.Beginning Jan. 18, Americans can visit COVIDtests.gov to order up to four rapid tests per household (officials originally said ordering would be available Jan.19, but instead it went live a day early).The move comes as the US struggles with soaring COVID-19 cases caused chiefly by the Omicron variant, which has smashed case count and hospitalization records nationwide.Tests will be free. The only information required for purchase is a name and mailing address. But officials estimated that the tests would not ship until 7–12 days after purchase, meaning the soonest they could arrive in homes is Jan. 26. Advertisement     In early December, the Biden administration unveiled a winter strategy for the Omicron variant, focusing on more people getting boosters, more vaccinations for school-age kids, as well as requirements for private insurers to pay for at-home tests. Later in the month, Biden announced plans to open 20,000 free testing sites and to send federal medical teams to assist overloaded hospitals, which are now being deployed.But the requirement for private insurers to cover at-home tests does not go into effect until Jan. 15, meaning it has not helped pay for rapid tests during the holiday Omicron surge. The administration also came under fire as at-home test supplies ran short on pharmacy shelves over the holidays as Omicron cases skyrocketed. This led to the first plans to make 500 million free tests available to Americans, followed by Friday’s doubling of that figure.Nam Tran, a professor of clinical pathology at the University of California, Davis, said he welcomed Friday’s announcement and noted that any expansion of testing is good news, but he cautioned that people need to remember how to test appropriately. “We shouldn't be just testing out of overall anxiety concern, we should be testing for good reasons,” he said.According to the CDC, rapid tests should be used if you have COVID symptoms, if you’ve been in close contact with someone who has COVID, or if you will be gathering indoors with someone who is either at high risk for severe disease or is unvaccinated.But if you’re asymptomatic, Tran said, it’s critical to test more than once, at least 36 hours apart. “Testing multiple times, over time, allows you to catch the virus when it reaches that level that becomes detectable,” he said. This means the four tests per household would only be enough to get a meaningful result for two asymptomatic people. In symptomatic individuals, Tran said, the viral load is likely high enough that one test should be sufficient to tell if that person is infectious.

57,From riveting short stories to dystopian horror.,"



 


Until We Fall by Nicole Zelniker (Jaded Ibis Press)In the aftermath of a disastrous election that mirrors the 2016 political climate in the United States, things in this novel’s country take a turn for the worse, and civil war breaks out. At first, Isla, a Black and transgender high school student has no idea her teacher, Ms. Young, is part of the resistance; what Isla does know is that her own mother is no longer allowed to work outside of the home, even though she doesn’t fully understand why. She also knows what her older sister Hannah tells her, like that being trans was not always illegal. This dystopian novel addresses how a nation loses democracy, while tracking how people find solace in a landscape of violence and loss of civil rights under an increasingly authoritarian government. Gorgeously written, Zelniker pinpoints the power that societies have to incite change.A Country of Ghosts by Margaret Killjoy (Black Dawn)Dimos, a wartime journalist in a fictional world, finds himself embedded in a rebel unit that has murdered the commander he was sent to profile. It’s often hard going for Dimos, who has to prove that he will not betray the anarchists who have both captured him and show him mercy. While he does not — and is never asked to — specifically renounce imperialism, Dimos comes to see what the insurgents are fighting for: a utopian society. It’s far from perfect, but then again, perfection is not the goal, community is. “One day,” Dimos says, “I realized food given freely tasted objectively better than food taken by force.” A short novel with the arc of an epic, A Country of Ghosts is a story of people who will give up everything, including their own lives, to live in a better world.I’m Not Hungry But I Could Eat by Christopher Gonzalez (Santa Fe Writers Project)A party features a washing machine that performs miracles, like cleaning leather pants; happy hours take place where people love the booze but don’t want the snacks; and a man has a second lunch with a best friend directly after his first solo lunch is finished, because it’s a way of loving her. I’m Not Hungry But I Could Eat follows mostly bi male characters as they wind their way through NYC, sometimes dancing, and sometimes eating a bodega sandwich. In all of these fifteen stories, Gonzalez threads a needle that knits together food, bodies, sexuality, and identity in a way that is both potent and earnest. A debut that leaves readers wanting a third and second helping.Stop Me If You’ve Heard This One Before by Brandon Getz (Six Gallery Press)God and the Devil play chess, though God prefers Yahtzee. An alchemic being crawls out of an ill father’s head after he serrates his own neck with a knife; taking care of both her father and the being, a woman wishes they would both die. A man has the half-beginnings of an affair in a taxidermy shop while he worries for his daughters, one who needs glasses and the other a scoliosis brace, neither of which the taxidermist’s health insurance covers. In these 12 stories, Getz fully embraces characters who are desperate, strange, and often have absolutely no idea what to do next. In this way he creates a collection that is deeply weird but also strikingly human. Advertisement     Out Front the Following Sea by Leah Angstman (Regal House Press)In this historical novel set in 1600s colonial America, after a hard winter, Ruth, who has already been branded as an outsider, loses her grandmother. With nothing left to anchor her to her village, she barely escapes a mob, and bargains for a passage on a ship where her childhood friend, Owen, is the first mate. Ruth chafes against customs and propriety, neither of which have ever done much for her. In a new town, she is taken in by an older couple. What follows is a violent reckoning for Ruth, and at every turn, she struggles against convention — and her connection with Owen does not make anything easier. A new voice in historical fiction, Angstman confronts America’s embedded racism, sexism, and religious hypocrisy. Intensely researched, at its center Out Front the Following Sea is a love story, and a page-turner at that.The History of Man by Siphiwe Gloria Ndlovu (Catalyst Press)Emil is the son of colonialists in an unnamed Southern African country. After boarding school, he follows the path that has been set for him, becoming a civil servant. When war breaks out in the country, he is swept up in the urgency of it, only to find himself directionless when a ceasefire is announced. The second book from Ndlovu, which follows some of the same themes and characters from her debut Theory of Flight, is often affectionate toward Emil, even when he doesn’t deserve it. Marked by his parents' conflicted marriage and his own complicity in racist policy, Emil must ask himself what his old boarding school motto of “turning boys into men” really means. Both complicated and insightful, this book leaves readers wondering what is next for Ndlovu.When Me and God Were Little by Mads Nygaard, translated from the Dutch by Steve Schein (Dzanc Books, Jan. 18)When Karl Gustav’s older brother drowns, he is sent to live with his grandmother in the country, and by the time he returns, his father’s lucrative construction business has attracted the attention of the police. After a trial, his family is forced to move into subsidized housing in a new town, young Karl obsessively plays soccer and befriends a classmate with a heart condition. All the while, the loss of his sibling has left Karl angry in a way he cannot express, and while he is too young to really comprehend what has happened to his parents financially, he does understand that nothing will ever be the same. Told from the perspective of a child who is both struggling and confident, Nygaard captures the wonderment of experiencing everything from the dreadful to the joyful for the very first time. A moving book from an unforgettable voice.The Man With Eight Pairs of Legs by Leslie Kirk Campbell (Sarabande Books, Feb. 1)An abused woman is not allowed to leave her own house until she makes a deal with her terrible husband, a cheating man believes he will be ready to die once he beats his wife at a word game they’ve been playing for years, and a tall woman who has struggled with cutting falls in love with a runner who has lost his legs. In these eight stories, Campbell spins tales of isolation that range from the desperate to the profound, and her clear prose cuts through the trepidation her characters often feel. A meaningful and utterly devastating collection that cements Campbell as a leading short story writer. Advertisement     New Animal by Ella Baxter (Two Dollar Radio, Feb. 15)Amelia Aurelia is a trained embalmer who focuses on cosmetics, doing the hair and makeup of the dead at her family’s small funeral parlor. She has a talent for the work, and she seems happy enough, living in the gatehouse of her mother and step-father’s home, occupying her free time with app hookups. Yet, when her mother dies in a sudden accident, Amelia is plunged into a freefall, and she escapes to her biological dad’s house in Tasmania where she discovers the local BDSM scene. While this novel is peppered with scenes in kink clubs and the macabre of Amelia’s profession — and is also, in places obscenely funny — this is a story of a young woman who has to figure out how to live without her mother and has to also understand how her two dads will put aside their differences to hold her through the loss of the woman they both loved. There is fiction about grief and then there is Ella Baxter’s New Animal. Truly stunning.How to Date a Flying Mexican: New and Collected Stories by Daniel A. Olivas (University of Nevada Press, Feb. 22)In these selected stories that come from Olivas’s long publishing career, the magical realism, fairy tales, and sometimes dystopias that have often been a thread in his work are even more deeply underscored. Many of the characters are everyday people who have a special power (like the widower Tony who can sculpt anything from mud and make it come alive with a short spell), or who are visited by otherworldly guests (like Ysrael who is called on by a confused bureaucrat from Hell). Throughout all of his stories, there are strong Chicano characters, who embody tales that range from the laugh-out-loud funny to the heartbreaking. A timely retrospective from an important voice in Latinx literature.Border Less by Namatra Podder (7.13 Books, Feb. 27)In her airline call center job, Dia works against the clock to resolve passenger complaints within the allotted time. She’s running on very little sleep, working the night shift while she finishes her university degree and helping her family when her father’s cancer has returned. Dia dreams of completing an MBA in the US, even as she deals with rude and entitled Americans on the phone, and she does eventually make it to California. This novel also follows other women in an interconnected narrative — like fashion designers and multilevel marketing “Supperwear” sellers. What emerges is a story that is made whole through its fragmentation. A thoughtful exploration of what it means to belong.Little Foxes Took Up Matches by Katya Kazbek (Tin House Books, April 5)Set in Moscow after the collapse of the Soviet Union, this novel follows child and preteen Mitya as he traverses the turmoil of growing up. Alternating between the harsh realities of Mitya’s life — a sexually abusive cousin, the murder of his friend, rampant alcoholism — and the lush, parallel retelling of a fairytale with a traditional Slavic character, this novel is layered with questions about mortality and identity. It is a coming-of-age story that is at times chilling and in equal moments heartfelt, and at the center of it, Mitya is simply trying to find his own way. Kazbek writes with a kind of urgency that makes her novel a true standout. Every page sparks with energy in this ambitious and original debut. Advertisement     New to Liberty by DeMisty D. Bellinger (Unnamed Press, April 19)Told in three sections that work backward, starting in 1966 and ending 1933, this novel from DeMisty D. Bellinger unfolds the story of three interconnected women. Set mostly in Kansas, during and after the Dust Bowl and Great Depression, Sissily, Nella, and Greta must negotiate their way through their respective times. Present always is the threat of violence toward women, especially women of color. An assault by strangers in an auto shop, and assaults by a father and a boyfriend. Though set in the past, this book reads as contemporary, in a painful acknowledgment of how while a lot may have changed from 1933, in some ways, there’s not been so much change at all. Written with raw clarity, New to Liberty addresses race, gender, and anti-LGBTQ prejudice in a way that both face discrimination head-on and also blends the experiences of Bellinger’s characters seamlessly into the narrative. Watch for this book on every “best of” list for 2022.Singing Lessons for the Stylish Canary by Laura Stanfill (Lanternfish Press, April 19)For hundreds of years in the rainy village of Mireville, France, craftspeople make musical instruments and lace to export. When baby Georges is born to the Blanchards, the skies part, and Mireville is suddenly drenched with sun, with some consequences. Sent to America to deliver a serinette (a historical device used to train canaries to sing) from his father’s workshop to a wealthy client, teenaged Georges is seduced by the woman and hastily returns to France to marry his school crush, only later learning of her pregnancy. Later, Georges’s second son, Henri, must untangle how his village has such narrow expectations that men make music and women tat, and embarks on a journey to meet his half-brother in America. While the plot focuses on the legacies of sons, it is women’s friendships and alliances that hold this book together. Stanfill writes with such lightness that even the heaviest parts of this novel float. A charming debut.Constellations of Eve by Abbigail Nguyen Rosewood (Texas Tech University Press, May 3)Eve, a visual artist who struggles to see the worth in her own practice, feels forced to choose between two loves: her best friend and her boyfriend. Soon enough, the boyfriend becomes a husband and the father of their child. Yet, as Eve and her spouse become increasingly distant, she reconnects with her old friend, only to find there may be a link between the friend and the husband. Eve is haunted by her photographer mother’s ideas of beauty, and her mother’s cautions about being caught in the eye of the beholder or being the beholden. Eve is also often isolated in a rural home. In strikingly searing prose, Rosewood unfolds a compelling story of betrayal and obsession.I Only Cry With Emoticons by Yuvi Zalkow (Red Hen Press, June 7)In this comic but still tender novel, Saul is an awkward tech employee trying to understand his recent divorce, his relationship to fatherhood, his job, and his new girlfriend. Saul is mostly awful at all of the above, but his effort is endearing. Zalkow gives us a character who is nearly desperate in his need for approval, yet ultimately manages to look outside of his own obsessions and understand the love he has been seeking was there all along. The smartwatch interruptions with codebase errors for the app Saul has helped architect for his job rings true for anyone who has worked in tech, but either way, I Only Cry With Emoticons masterfully captures both the anxiety and hope of our modern lives. ● Advertisement

58,"The pandemic has lent momentum to the labor movement, but union losses at HelloFresh food-packing warehouses reveal the challenges of convincing some workers that the fight is worth the risks.","


Workers who pack and ship boxes of food for HelloFresh in California voted against unionizing at the end of last year despite facing high rates of injury, low wages, and a major COVID-19 outbreak, a loss for the labor movement that reflects the ongoing challenges facing organizers two years into the pandemic.In summer 2020, a HelloFresh food-packing facility in Richmond, just north of Oakland, was the site of the largest COVID-19 outbreak in one of the state’s most populous counties, a wave that infected 171 workers at one warehouse. After an employee who worked at the facility died of COVID, state health and safety officials opened an investigation and in April 2021 charged the company with a “serious” violation. Advertisement     A labor union for the food and hospitality workers, UNITE HERE, started looking into working conditions at HelloFresh and published government data that showed rates of injury at the Richmond facility in 2020 were more than three times the average for the warehousing industry and almost twice as high as the average for workers in prepared food manufacturing.And workers faced those risks all while getting paid at an $18-an-hour rate that amounted to less than a living wage in the Bay Area, according to calculations by researchers at MIT.To organizers at UNITE HERE, the combination of those conditions made HelloFresh a prime target for unionizing — especially at a time when the risks of working through the pandemic seemed to have sparked a turning point in the American labor movement as workers demanded higher pay, pushed for safer working conditions, and walked out the door in record numbers. Strikes and walkouts doubled between fall 2020 and fall 2021, reported Bloomberg, which concluded that unions are “having a moment.” The Washington Post called this so-called strike wave “historic.” NBC deemed 2021 “the year of the worker.”But in November and December, HelloFresh workers in both Richmond, California, and Aurora, Colorado, voted decisively against the union — of 763 eligible workers in Richmond, 198 voted in favor of joining UNITE HERE, while 289 voted against, a similar spread to the results in Aurora. Advertisement     Even as public support for unions swelled and the labor movement gained momentum, actually persuading workers to form new unions remained a challenge.For some workers earning around $18 an hour in Richmond, the prospect of union dues cutting into their already tight budgets was enough to turn them against the initiative.“If we applied for the union, they’re going to take our extra money,” HelloFresh employee Candy Hatcher said, referring to the dues employees would pay if the union won. “I have bills. I have rent and everything,”
 


The number of successful union campaigns dropped following the start of the pandemic, both because it limited face-to-face organizing and because the agency paused elections during the early months of the outbreak. In 2020, 577 unions were certified and 661 in 2021, down from 901 in 2019 and 1,076 in 2015, according to data collected by Miami University assistant professor of political science Kevin Reuning. The trend predates the pandemic: In the last six years, the total number of newly unionized workers has plummeted — from 53,765 in 2015 to ​​45,189 in 2019 to 31,445 in 2021 — while the percentage of elections that unions win has hovered consistently around 50%.The recent setbacks for labor organizers reflect the difficulty of convincing workers who are paid low wages and have minimal employment protections that the benefits of collective bargaining are worth the financial costs and the risks of losing employment at companies aggressively pushing against unionizing.“It’s hard for all workers to organize, but it’s especially hard for the more vulnerable workers to organize,” said Rebecca Givan, a labor studies professor at Rutgers. “Campaigns of intimidation can be very successful because these workers know that they are living a precarious life. It really helps employers take advantage of employees when the employees feel fortunate to have a job instead of feeling they have a right to demand more.”
 


At HelloFresh, which is what’s called a “second-chance employer,” some employees have criminal convictions on their records, which bars them from a range of other jobs, including driving for Lyft or Uber. Others are immigrants with limited English-speaking skills. All face one of the most severe housing shortages in the country; a quarter of Bay Area residents don’t make enough money to make ends meet.Like many companies, HelloFresh maintained a website that discouraged workers from voting for the union. The website, My HelloFresh Voice, told workers they could be “permanently replaced” if they went on strike, and it included a calculator that showed how much they could earn if they invested their dues rather than paying the union $59.60 per month.The vote against the union at the HelloFresh facilities in some ways mirrors the ongoing high-profile union election at an Amazon facility in Bessemer, Alabama; following a decisive loss, both unions charged the employer with illegally interfering in the election process. While workers at Amazon succeeded in that effort and will begin voting by mail in a rerun of the election on Feb. 4, workers at HelloFresh await an investigation by federal labor regulators into their objection to the election results in Colorado and charges of unfair labor practice in California.Workers who supported the union had “wanted HelloFresh to finally listen to their concerns about disrespect, dangerous working conditions, and pay,” a spokesperson for the union said in a statement immediately following the election, “but instead HelloFresh spent thousands of dollars a day on an aggressive anti-union campaign.”In a statement, the company said that the election had made it “resoundingly clear” that employees “trust in HelloFresh to work in their best interest.” The company denied that it had interfered illegally with the union election process and said the goal of the union website was to “create an open dialogue with our employees, enabling them to make informed decisions” about unionizing. HelloFresh said it took steps to improve safety measures in 2021 and reduced its injury rate to below the industry average. “Employees are at the heart of everything we do, and we prioritize their health, safety and wellbeing above all else,” the statement said. Advertisement     While there are laws against intimidating and threatening employees who want to unionize, enforcement mechanisms are weak and consequences for employers are limited, said Lola Loustaunau, a University of Oregon sociologist who in 2020 published research on why workers vote against unions.“It benefits them to violate labor law,” she said of employers generally. “They could fire you, and you can file a fair labor practice claim later, but what does that do for a person who needs their paycheck this week?”
 


As Bay Area COVID-19 cases climbed to new highs in summer 2020, Contra Costa County health officials noticed that one employer “kept coming up,” according to workplace health and safety documents: HelloFresh.When health inspector Heather Cedermaz went out to investigate the Richmond facility on July 20, 2020, the company said it had 26 recorded coronavirus cases in its workplace, but county records showed at least 54 cases among HelloFresh employees in that facility. While she found HelloFresh cooperative, she wasn’t satisfied with its COVID protocols, she later told California workplace safety officials. People were grouped by doorways and eating together in a crowded break room, the plexiglass barriers meant to reduce exposure between people working side by side were hung too high to be effective, and employees weren’t properly wearing their masks. Documents show that in official mitigation strategies sent to HelloFresh, the public health department recommended the company take “immediate actions,” including reducing the on-site workforce by 40% by July 22, 2020, and testing all employees by July 29.By then, Wilfredo Alvarez, a 64-year-old HelloFresh employee who’d been working on the production line in Richmond for three years, had been hospitalized with COVID-19 for over a week. His children kept in touch with their dad’s employer, according to text messages included in documents provided to BuzzFeed News by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The family updated company human resources representatives on which hospital he was in and kept them abreast of his condition. William, one of Alvarez’s sons, told state health and safety officials that he had also informed the company of his dad’s positive COVID-19 diagnosis, and text messages show he told them when he also contracted the virus himself and had to quarantine. Advertisement     “Dad is stable but still in critical conditions,” William texted a HelloFresh HR representative on July 21. “But slowly he’s getting better.”After Alvarez had come to San Francisco from Nicaragua, he first worked as a salesperson, pitching farm equipment to agricultural workers throughout the region, before eventually ending up at HelloFresh, one of his sons, Wilfredo Jr., told BuzzFeed News. Even into his 60s, Alvarez was active, jumping rope with his grandkids at a birthday party in early July. Though he was nearing retirement age, he had no plans to stop working. The youngest of his 12 children was 12 years old, and he wanted to keep earning to support his kids’ education.Wilfredo Jr. said that his dad was careful about COVID-19 and rarely went anywhere else besides work. “He always took care of his health,” he said. “When this whole COVID thing started, even to come see us and spend time with us, he would come wearing his gloves and mask the whole time.”But his precautions weren’t enough to ward off the virus. On July 9, Alvarez, who had never been tested for COVID-19 at work, called out sick, telling his employer that his symptoms must be a result of his diabetes acting up. Less than a week later, he tested positive for COVID and was admitted to the hospital.In an email exchange reviewed by BuzzFeed News, HelloFresh’s US head of corporate safety and security, Mitchell Jacobs, told state officials that, according to information provided to him by human resources, after Alvarez was hospitalized, the company didn’t hear about his condition again until the county health department called to inform the company of Alvarez’s death. But text message records show that, on July 29, one of Alvarez’s sons texted a HelloFresh representative about his dad’s condition, saying, “I’m still hoping for a miracle and hoping for the best but I'm looking for funeral homes already.” Later that night, Alvarez died, alone in the intensive care unit of a hospital in Vacaville, California.“My dad didn’t make it,” Alvarez’s son told a HelloFresh employee via text message.“Oh my goodness. No I’m so so sorry. I’m so sorry,” the HelloFresh employee responded.Cedermaz heard about Alvarez’s death from the hospital and instructed the company to report the fatality to the state, which it did, 12 days after his death. The accident report stated that HelloFresh was “unsure of the cause of death” and had “no knowledge as to if [Alvarez] was positive for COVID-19 or not.” Advertisement     In a statement to BuzzFeed News, the company said that “HelloFresh has at all times fully met its reporting obligations in a timely manner, and has at all times followed our voluntary and industry-leading operating procedure when we have been made aware of self-reported incidents of COVID-19 among our team, including multi-level contact tracing and quarantine.”The day after the report of Alvarez’s death was filed, state health inspectors came to the Richmond facility to inspect the company’s COVID-19 protocols. There, they encountered many of the same issues the county’s investigator had found three weeks before: Employees were grouped too close together, some handwashing stations had no water, and while there were ""barriers between production line workers,"" the partitions were located ""above their heads!""Health and safety officials continued working with HelloFresh, which in September informed them that its director of safety and security, Craig Gage, had “left the position” and was being replaced by newly hired Mitchell Jacobs. On Sept. 22, Jacobs took a state official on another facility tour in which they encountered one worker “without a face covering,” a second “without a face covering placed over his mouth and nose,” a third “not wearing their face covering,” and a fourth “without a face covering in place,” according to state health and safety documents. Gage didn’t respond to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News; HelloFresh did not respond to questions regarding his departure from the company.
 


Lontrell Bolton, who was working for HelloFresh that summer, said he felt as though the company “didn’t really care” about whether employees were getting sick or bringing the virus to work. He remembered thinking it was strange that employees were allowed to sit together at lunch inside with their masks off.“The outbreak was there a long time, but nobody really said anything,” Bolton told BuzzFeed News. The priority, he said, was keeping the facility open, not keeping the virus out.“All you had to do to get in is say you haven't been tested and you could get in,"" he said.By the time the state health and safety agency completed its investigation, it agreed that HelloFresh hadn’t done enough to protect its staff from the worst of the pandemic. The agency was not able to conclusively determine whether Alvarez contracted the virus at work, on April 5, 2021. But it concluded that the company had failed to keep workers appropriately distanced, provide barriers, and enforce mask rules; officials charged the company with one moderate and one serious health and safety violation and fined it $8,995.In a statement, HelloFresh said it worked quickly to roll out COVID-19 safety procedures, including “increased sick pay, daily hospital-grade deep cleanings, mask mandates, strict social distancing, upgraded air filtration systems, and paid time off for quarantines.”The company has not paid the fine but said it is in “close conversations with CalOSHA pertaining to the ongoing citation and [looks] forward to reaching a final resolution once the investigation is complete.” The company said it was “deeply saddened to learn of Mr. Alvarez's passing” but “unable to link this incident to work-related exposure.”The Alvarez family believes their dad contracted the virus at work — but because HelloFresh wasn’t testing employees daily, there’s no way to know. “They should have done their contact tracing,” Wilfredo Jr. said. “If they have to shut down until they figured things out, they should have done that.”Almost a year and a half after Alvarez died, his family is still waiting to have a funeral. He wanted to be buried in Nicaragua, but the expense of flying the whole family down, plus the cost of complying with local COVID testing protocols, is still too high. Meanwhile, his older children have had to support their youngest siblings in addition to their own kids, who still get emotional when they think about their grandfather, Wilfredo Jr. said.“The last conversation I had with him, he told my kids, ‘I’ll see you guys soon, I’m fine!’ Which we knew he wasn’t, but he wasn’t going to tell my kids that,” he said. “He wasn’t done. He wanted to live.”
 


Rusty Barnes, a HelloFresh employee for four years, lived across the street from Wilfredo Alvarez, not far from the facility where they both worked. From the moment Barnes, 55, first heard that a union might come to HelloFresh through a coworker on his team in the shipping department in fall 2021, he was on board. “That company is a joke,” he said. “They needed to go union.”Even without a global pandemic, working in a warehouse where large pallets of food are being stored, moved, broken down, and repacked into smaller boxes to be shipped to homes across the country can be a physically taxing job. Workers reported injuries in every month of 2020 — including wrist strains from lifting, bruises from tripping over onions, contusions from having a “foot ran over by the pallet jack,” and the “crushing of multiple lower extremities” by “parts and materials on top of a rack,” according to state health and safety documents. In September, an employee strained her neck after “another employee fell on top of [her] and knocked her to the ground.” According to UNITE HERE, workers at HelloFresh’s Richmond facility in 2020 were injured 4.8 times as frequently as the average worker in private industry. The company said it reduced its injury rate in 2021.Barnes said it’s easy to trip over loose pieces of wood or pallet straps on the floor in the shipping area where he works. He doesn’t mind the physical nature of the work, he said, but he believes his experience and expertise should earn him a higher wage than what production line workers make. He lives with his 81-year-old mother and drives her car to work because he can’t afford to fix his truck; his main reason for supporting the union was financial.“I stack boxes on pallets, and I don’t think anyone else has ever did it for as long as I’ve been doing it, and I still make just as much as the guy that’s been there for a year,” he said. “I don’t feel it's right.”Barnes said the company’s response to the union was aggressive. “They were passing out beanies saying ‘Vote no.’ They were giving out masks that said ‘Vote no.’ They had signs all over the wall everywhere that said ‘Vote no.’ And they kept taking people into meetings almost every day.” According to unfair labor practice charges later filed by the union, the company wasn't just ""distributing anti-union masks and hats to employees"" but ""requiring employees to wear them."" The charges didn’t specify how the company enforced that requirement. Barnes said he didn’t wear the hat, and that he taped a pro-union message onto this safety vest. UNITE HERE didn’t respond to questions about the charges it filed.Supporters tried to keep the union organizing secret from management, Barnes said. But by the time they publicly announced the campaign and filed for an election on Sept. 23, the company had already hired an anti-union firm that cost $3,500 per day per consultant to work in California and Colorado, according to HuffPost. After that, the company tried multiple strategies to curtail enthusiasm for the union. HelloFresh tech workers who asked questions about the working conditions their colleagues in the processing facilities were experiencing were ignored or shut down by management, Vice reported.In October, the union filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board accusing HelloFresh of violating labor law. Workers said the company had illegally intimidated employees in Richmond who vocally supported the union by denying them access to the restroom, preventing them from receiving lunch, demoting them, and sending them home from work without pay. The union also accused the company of prohibiting employees from distributing union pamphlets, a legally protected activity, and “using physical force against employees,” the charge stated.HelloFresh said it plans to refute the charges of unfair labor practices but declined to comment further on an “ongoing investigation.”Ballots started going out to HelloFresh workers in Richmond on Nov. 18. On Nov. 23, UNITE HERE learned it had lost the election at HelloFresh in Aurora. Meanwhile, two workers in California told a local news outlet funded by Chevron that the labor union only wanted to collect dues and was exaggerating health and safety issues to scare them. On Dec. 15, the votes came in — the union had lost.UNITE HERE contested the results of the election in Colorado, but not the one in Richmond, although the union did file additional unfair labor practice charges in early January, accusing HelloFresh management of ""making a rule against displaying union insignia,"" promising raises after the election ended, and enforcing certain rules only against employees who supported the union, among other charges.“We are determined to hold HelloFresh accountable for its brazen and disgusting anti-union tactics,” spokesperson Ted Waechter said in a statement immediately following the election.In Bessemer, Alabama, Amazon workers won a do-over election because a regional director for the NLRB found that the corporation had broken the law; the second round of voting will begin on Feb. 4 and votes will be counted on March 28, a year and four months after the union first filed for election. Givan, the Rutgers professor, warned that the rerun process is “long, it’s expensive, and it’s really, really difficult.” Workers at a Smithfield Foods plant eventually won a rerun election in 2008, Givan said, but it took three tries and 16 total years.At the time the union lost the Amazon election in Alabama at the beginning of 2021, many union leaders and labor scholars spoke about the need for Congress to pass the Protect the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would have prohibited employers from mandating attendance at anti-union meetings and introduced monetary penalties for companies that broke the law. But one year later, those policies still haven’t become law, though Congress continues to negotiate the $2 trillion Build Back Better bill, which contains some elements of the PRO Act.Today, labor leaders have shifted their hopes to President Joe Biden’s appointee for NLRB general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, who has said she plans to use her power to more forcefully police employers. A recent settlement gave the NLRB more power to punish Amazon, as the New York Times first reported.For the moment, though, worker protections remain unchanged, leaving people who “are already pretty low-wage workers in pretty hazardous conditions, barely making ends meet, being confronted with the possibility of losing what little they have,” the University of Oregon’s Loustaunau said.Rusty Barnes, the shipping worker, said HelloFresh ran “a nasty anti-union campaign” that, for now, has succeeded. “They scared a lot of people to vote no,” he said.During the election, he and other employees received a text message from HelloFresh about a wage raise, which he believed meant a retroactive $1-an-hour pay increase when the election was over. “It would make a lot of difference,” said Barnes, who makes $18.86 an hour and planned to put the money toward repairing his truck. But so far, the raise hasn’t appeared, and when he brought it up with HR, he said, a representative told him he already makes the maximum rate for his position.HelloFresh said it did raise its national minimum wage after the union election ended, but that how the raise impacted employees depended on where in the country they worked; employees with questions should ""reach out to their local human resources team,"" a spokesperson said.Barnes said he wants to help the union keep fighting at HelloFresh, but he’s also thinking about finding another job.“I got bills just like everybody else,” he said. “All they care about is getting their boxes out.” ●

“Like do people really like look up to her etc. I find her so so boring,” they went on.
 


“mason disick absolutely does not care i can’t wait for the kardashian kids to grow up it’s going to be hilarious,” wrote the user, who presumably didn’t realize the account was a parody.
 


“This is hilarious but so obviously a fake account,” tweeted one person.
 


“i just realized my mom blocked me … omgggg,” wrote the account, still posing as Mason.
 


He also hilariously (and brutally) mocked his parents when asked why his Instagram account had disappeared. “It got deleted because I was ‘too young,’ because I went viral. I would have had 2.7 mil [followers] by now if I'd kept it up,” he said.
 


“Mom, I’m live!” giggled North while pointing the camera directly at Kim, who was cozied up in bed and clearly taken aback.“No! Stop, you’re not allowed to,” said Kim, before asking someone nearby, “Come on, is she really live?”
 


“I did the exact same thing as she did,” he went on to write. “I would do the lives and now I regret saying one of the things that I said.”Kim replied, “I appreciate you looking out Mason. And I agree. She felt bad and I don’t think she will do it again but it could be good if you talk to her about it.”

60,"While her divorce from Kanye appears to have hit a rough patch, it seems like Kim and Pete are going from strength to strength.","Pete Davidson: comedian, actor, and now…~Instagram boyfriend?~ It seems like the multitalented Saturday Night Live star might have another skill to add to his résumé, because fans are convinced that Kim Kardashian just recruited Pete to shoot her vacation thirst traps. On Monday, Kim shared three brand-new pictures that look to be from her recent getaway to the Bahamas, where she kicked off the new year with her rumored boyfriend. But, stunning as she looked, fans couldn’t help but gravitate towards a suspicious-looking shadow in the third and final image. The seemingly short-haired silhouette — which appears to be holding a raised iPhone and snapping the photograph of Kim cooly reclining on the sandy beach — instantly prompted fans to flood the comments section with theories about just who could be behind the lens. Given that fans knew that Kim’s last vacation had been with Pete, it wasn’t long before the comments section concluded that the sandy silhouette must be that of her love interest. “The shadow is Pete we all agree right,” commented one sleuth, whose popular theory amassed thousands of likes. “Did Pete take these,” asked another intrigued detective. Some were even questioning Pete’s supposed photography skills, quipping in the comments: “Tell Pete to not get a shadow next time.” But despite fans’ overwhelming optimism, we must also entertain the possibility that Kim might have called upon the help of one of her other vacation buddies, as she and Pete were also joined by Kim's longtime friends Simon Huck and Phil Riportella. But if you were wondering why a simple shadow has garnered so much attention from fans, there are two possible explanations to discuss. Firstly, because Kim has yet to personally confirm that she is dating Pete, the sneaky incorporation of his shadow in a social media post would be quite the milestone at this point in their relationship — especially given that Instagram plays a huge part in how Kim navigates her public image. Secondly, these pictures — which may or may not include Pete’s shadow — come days after a whole host of drama erupted between Kim and Kanye (now legally known as Ye) this weekend. Despite their split unfolding fairly amicably since Kim filed for divorce last February, things became very messy on Saturday when Ye publicly called out his ex for apparently not inviting him to their daughter's fourth birthday party. In a video shared to social media, the rapper claimed that Kim and the rest of the Kardashian-Jenner family had refused to give him the location of Chicago’s party, and that he “wasn’t allowed” to know where it was taking place. Kanye went on to allege that he'd reached out to Kim and their nannies without success and explained that he was concerned that his absence would negatively impact his daughter’s perception of him as a father. “I done called Kim, texted nannies. I got on the phone with Tristan… He said he asked Khloé,” Ye explained. “Won’t nobody give me the address to my daughter’s birthday party right now. That’s gonna imprint in her mind that I wasn’t there for her.” The video rapidly went viral and prompted mixed reactions from fans. Many questioned why Kim might deny Kanye access to the party, particularly in light of the fact that their coparenting relationship seemed to be functioning well up until this point. But, a few hours later, it appeared that Ye had gained access to the party, and footage of him smiling and celebrating with Chi surfaced online. In a second video shared after the party was over, Kanye shed more light on the situation and revealed that the dispute had been “calmly and legally” diffused with the help of Kylie Jenner and her partner, Travis Scott, who he thanked for providing him with the address and letting him onto the premises. However, Kanye did also claim that security guards had initially prevented him from entering the party before Kylie came and intervened. “Kylie let me in right when I got to the spot because the security stopped me once again when I got there … It’s just a matter of having a conversation, open dialogue,” he explained. Interestingly, the events that unfolded on Saturday were preceded by a wide-ranging interview in which Ye alluded to similar issues relating to coparenting and security. Speaking to Hollywood Unlocked earlier in the week, Kanye addressed the backlash he received after it was reported that he had purchased a home directly opposite Kim’s. This decision sparked conversation among fans in light of Kanye’s impassioned statements about wanting to reunite with Kim despite her filing to be “legally single.” Addressing the controversy in last week’s interview, the father of four explained that he bought the home to be closer to his children and called out the media for allegedly pushing a more sinister narrative. “My solace comes from seeing my kids and getting a solid schedule. That’s why I even got the house … [The media made it seem like] there was something wrong with me getting a house next to my kids,” he said. “Don’t play with me, don’t play with my children. Ain’t no security gonna get in between me and my children and you ain’t gonna gaslight me.” Ye also went on to recall an incident involving the security guards at Kim’s home, alleging that he was refused access to the house on a recent occasion after having collected the children from school. “Earlier this week, Monday, when I went to go pick my kids up from school, the security stopped me at the gate,” he claimed. “My daughter wanted me to go inside. I was like, I am the richest Black man and North's father, right, and the security was able to stop me from going into the room with my daughter and that had not been defined.” This prompted Kanye to theorize that the reason he had not been permitted access was because Kim’s boyfriend, Pete, was inside at the time. “I am hearing that the new boyfriend is actually in the house that I can't even go to,” he said, despite conflicting reports that allege that Pete has actually never been to Kim’s house or met her children. Clearly upset by the possibility, Ye went on to publicly drag Kim and her new relationship with Pete, calling her out for kissing him during an SNL skit in October a matter of days before they were first romantically linked. “How you gonna bring me to SNL and kiss the dude you dating right in front of me, and everybody’s like, ‘Aw, that’s cool,’” he said. Interestingly, just a few days prior to this interview, Kanye broke his silence on Kim’s relationship in some pretty brutal new lyrics. In his brand-new track, “Eazy,” Ye raps frankly about his divorce from Kim, throws major shade at the Kardashians, and gives a mention to his new love interest, Julia Fox — but it was a particularly vicious bar about Pete that shocked fans the most. Without holding back, Ye raps: “God saved me from that crash / Just so I can beat Pete Davidson's ass,” which is followed by a woman’s voice saying, “Who?” While Kim has yet to comment on any of last week’s drama, her Bahamas throwback photo appears to suggest she's making an effort to publicly distance herself from her ex-husband. In fact, after reports that the former couple are “not on good terms” at the moment, a source told People on Monday that Kim is trying her hardest to steer clear of the drama. “It's a lot of drama right now. Kim is trying her best to ignore it all, though. She doesn't want the kids to know what's going on,” the insider claimed. “It's all getting very complicated.” Yet although her relationship with Ye is clearly under a lot of strain, it seems like things with Pete are going from strength to strength. Just last week the duo were spotted on a low-key pizza date, which fans couldn’t help but realize was a stark contrast from the usual luxury of Kim’s lifestyle. But, as many pointed out, the uncharacteristically laid-back date night had a much greater significance than meets the eye. During an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians — which was reportedly filmed about a month before she filed for divorce — Kim revealed that she had grown tired of her “extravagant” marriage to Ye and instead was yearning for the “smaller” and more meaningful experiences. “It’s the little things that I don’t have,” Kim said at the time. “I have all the big things. I have [everything] extravagant you could possibly imagine. And no one will ever do it like that [again]. I’m grateful for those experiences [with Kanye], but I think I’m ready for the smaller experiences that I think will mean a lot.” And it seems that things are going well for Pete, too. In fact, the day after Kanye literally threatened to “beat [his] ass,” Pete made light of the situation during an episode of SNL that aired in the wake of the drama. During a skit where James Austin Johnson was impersonating President Joe Biden, Pete appeared as an ~alternate~ Biden from a parallel universe and proudly took the opportunity to poke fun at his own love life. When asked by a “reporter” what life is like in the alternate universe, Pete (as Biden) explained that only one person was better off in our reality. “Everyone on Earth is better off in the real world, except one man named Pete Davidson,” he said with a smile creeping onto his face. “Your world is maybe more fun for him.” And if his recent trip to the Bahamas is anything to go by, it sounds like he’s definitely not wrong."

62,"After a TV host said it was ""dangerous"" to put an exercise outfit on a plus-size mannequin, this woman bought and posed in the outfit to make a point about body shaming.","


A plus-size woman who went viral after posing in a lime green athleisure outfit told BuzzFeed News that she hopes that one day we can get to a place where fat people buying clothes isn’t considered revolutionary.While plus-size mannequins have generally been embraced by brands and celebrated by activists as a step in the right direction for body acceptance, the sight of one didn’t seem to have the same impact on one conservative British TV host. Advertisement     “This, in a Regent St fitness store, is what obesity looks like. Flabby curves highlighted in hideous lime green velour,” tweeted Isabel Oakeshott, a GB News presenter who describes herself as a “professional feather ruffler.”The commentator criticized the window display at a London branch for Fabletics, which featured a plus-size mannequin dressed in a velour three-piece set, and called the body positivity movement “dangerous.”In response, Sophia Tassew, a content creator and business owner from London, served up the best reply when she shared a photo of herself looking fantastic in the “dangerous” outfit, which she went out to purchase for herself.
 


“That was my statement in itself,” Tassew told BuzzFeed News.“It's like, you guys are gonna have to get used to us. Thanks for sharing the fit. Now I'm going to cop it, and life goes on,” she said.The 24-year-old, who designs and owns a jewelry brand, wants it to be known that she “genuinely just liked the outfit.” She didn’t intend her response to be a major clapback, but Tassew said she recognizes that simply existing as a fat woman is seen by some as a statement.“Me, just being a plus-size person, I want a new outfit, and it's caused all this commotion, and it really shouldn't actually be that way, but it is,” Tassew said. “It's still seen as something that's a big deal, revolutionary, when we just want a new pair of leggings.”The reaction to her post has largely been positive, she said, noting that the store manager of that specific location told her that the mannequin in question has often prompted an emotional response from customers.“She gets people coming into her store crying because of the mannequin, and I was like, wow. So as long as it's done more good than anything, then I'm completely fine. I'm happy,” Tassew said.
 


Her post, which has more than 400K likes and over 30K retweets, prompted other women to share photos of themselves in the outfit.Tassew said that she no longer identified with the body positivity movement, calling them buzzwords and a movement that had been co-opted. Now, she champions the right to a quality of life.“I think my thing now is about fat liberation and just trying to understand how fat people can move around the world freely because obviously the world is not designed for us,” she said.The business owner has previously worked with the likes of fashion retailer Asos as a style insider and influencer, routinely modeling and creating content highlighting the best pieces for plus-size consumers.Since Tassew went viral, representatives for Fabletics have reached out to her. Fabletics, an athleisure brand cofounded by actor Kate Hudson, is routinely championed for having an inclusive offering, with sizes ranging from 0 to 24. Advertisement     Tassew is hopeful that her influence can be channeled into representing what it means to be fat in a world where anti-fat behavior persists.“It's so much deeper than just taking selfies to show your rolls,” Tassew said. “We're affected in so many ways that people don't actually realize, whether that be medically, financially, or socially.”

63,“My mom was emotionally strained and she snapped. She started hitting me with a large beaded purse that had a camera inside. She repeatedly swung the bag and landed several blows on my shoulders.”,"


Britney was placed under the legal arrangement back in 2008, leaving her life and finances to be controlled by her father and other lawyers. Denouncing the conservatorship in a court hearing last June, the singer said that she’d found its terms to be “abusive,” while accusing her mother, father, and sister of doing “nothing” to help.Britney was freed from the legal arrangement in November 2021. While she’s taken to Instagram and Twitter on several occasions to drag her family for their silence and alleged complicity, the pop star has yet to speak out on a televised platform, recently revealing that she’s “scared” to do interviews.
 


“I ran to the shopping center next door to where we lived. I used a payphone to call my brother: ‘Bryan, mom is going crazy,’” the passage concludes.
 


“The only reason I was being mean to her was because I just wanted her to stand up for me or stand up for herself. And I think that just became all too much,” she said, adding that she would often go and stay with her brother, Bryan, who was 14 years older than her, when she didn’t want to be around her mom.She continued, “I did feel bad for how I treated [her], and that’s very unlike my mom... I needed to get away from her for a lot of reasons.”
 


“Now, me and my mom, we obviously have talked about that. I told her I’m sharing that [in the memoir],” she said.“I know that my family have been through some dumb ass shit... but I don’t want people to go after [my mom] and try to punish her,” she added. “That was a situation that went on between me and her. Me and her worked it out.”
 


“I can’t diminish my experiences no matter whether it was my mother, my sister, my brother... I have to respect my experiences, and I guess I just don’t know how to do that ‘cause I don’t wanna hurt anybody’s feelings,” she said.
 


“I was a prop to a lot of things, but at the same time I was never allowed to control my own narrative or have my own voice unless it was in line with everything,” she said.“I was never allowed to do anything or say anything that would possibly put my sister in a bad light. And honestly, I love my sister... But guess what? Sisters are sisters... why wasn’t that just made normal from the beginning?”
 


“Why can’t two sisters exist in their own right? We never compared each other, the world did. We never had that dynamic or that issue. My sister to this day is going to always, to me, be the most badass performer that ever walked on this Earth and nothing’s gonna change that,” she said.“The problem was that I couldn’t be responsible for everything that happened around her and also be authentic to myself... I guess I didn’t have the courage to do it, I guess I was too scared.”
 


“My whole life I kind of felt like I didn’t matter,” she said in tears.
 


“I got to experience watching a woman take over the fucking world. How can I be jealous of that?” she questioned.
 


“Then, where the lady mentioned, ‘Why did she accuse you of doing remixes to her songs’ — I know it may sound like a silly thing to most people, but I wrote a lot of my songs. And my sister was the baby. She never had to work for anything. Everything was always given to her,” she added.

66,The success of Wordle traces back to a small group of nerdy New Zealanders who were looking for a pandemic distraction.,"


The success of Wordle, the game most easily characterized by the green-and-yellow square emojis that are saturating Twitter feeds worldwide, traces back to a small group of nerdy New Zealanders who were looking for a pandemic distraction.“The close ties across the country means it isn't hard for things to spread — whether that be gossip, word games, or good public health measures to keep us safe during a pandemic,” said Asher Wilson-Goldman, a public sector communications professional who was one of the first people to start tweeting about the game. Advertisement  New York software engineer Josh Wardle designed Wordle for his partner. Since November, its daily traffic has skyrocketed from 90 users to 2 million.
 


According to data provided by Twitter, since Wardle released the game in November 2021, there have been 1.7 million tweets mentioning ""Wordle"" globally. But a Twitter thread from New Zealand in late November really kicked it off. Advertisement  “Have you been playing Wordle? Like Mastermind (the board game) but for 5-letter words,"" Kiwi web developer David Ritchie tweeted Nov. 24. “I nailed today's in 3 attempts.”
 


Andrew Chen, 29, a research fellow at the University of Auckland who helped the government with its COVID-19 contact-tracing app, saw Ritchie’s tweet. “I like logic and word puzzles generally (stuff like Sudoku and escape rooms), and I really liked Mastermind once upon a time. I was hooked straight away,” he told BuzzFeed News.The premise of Wordle works as such: You have six tries to guess a five-letter word. The game is updated with a new word daily.So Chen started sharing his results under the thread and comparing them with other mutual connections. Which meant that Paul Brislen, a telecommunications executive in his 50s, took note of his Twitter colleagues talking about five-letter words on his feed. A former journalist himself and self-described “word nerd,” Brislen liked the idea of a pared-down, distraction-free game that forced you to “concentrate and use your brain.”
 


Participants followed the golden rule of never tweeting the answer. “That meant there was no feeling of exclusion or being too late to the party,” Brislen said. “I think that was quite important at the start. We were all in it together.”Wilson-Goldman said he encountered the thread still simmering in this small group of Twitter colleagues. “I think when I joined, there were maybe five or six people already playing through the thread, and I already followed about half of them,” he said.
 


More of their Kiwi digital friends began sharing results and number of tries under that same thread every day. It began to get a little chaotic with the flurry of messaging, so Kelsy Fletcher, a New Zealand public servant and longtime connection of Chen’s from school, suggested they use a hashtag instead, and #DailyWordleClub was born.“It felt more like you were indicating that you were part of the club than as a way to collate content,” Chen said.Even the square emojis came directly from the New Zealand crew. Elizabeth S., an adviser to the New Zealand government, found it would be “much easier” to describe their results using colored emoji tiles for an easy, spoiler-free way of sharing. The format caught on among the #DailyWordleClub members — and then Wardle implemented it in the site’s share option.
 


“There was some analysis done a while ago that showed the New Zealand Twitter community is more highly interconnected than in other countries,” Chen said. “I mean, we like to say that there's two degrees of separation in New Zealand.”Google searches for “Wordle” first began spiking in New Zealand around mid-December 2021. This pattern was quickly followed a few days later in Australia after Aussie journalists who follow some of the original New Zealand players saw it and began tweeting. On Dec. 23, Guardian Australia became the first publication to write about it; the outlet embedded six tweets from people playing the game, but only one appeared to belong to someone outside the blue-checked media community.After the Guardian article, searches began spiking in the United Kingdom and Canada. A New York Times reporter based in London profiled the origins of the game on Jan. 3. Since then, Google searches for the term “wordle” have skyrocketed over fifteenfold.
 


The internet has seen similar trends to this before, in which a trend grows from the media’s own personal interest, rather than via organic usage by people who don’t work in media. We saw it happen with “cheugy,” a term resurfaced ironically by TikTok user @webkinzwhore143. The term was pushed into the online zeitgeist after relentless media coverage about it. What began as a casual joke surrounding a teen-fabricated term to highlight millennials’ awkward aesthetic became a widely used word, in part due to media outlets’ immediate gravitation toward it.Often, it’s been journalists building the Wordle trend, as word lovers who play the game, fall in love with it, tweet about it (often from their blue-checked accounts), and then write stories about it, encouraging others to do the same.In just under a month, 228 articles have been published about Wordle. Between Jan. 1 and Jan. 13, 1.2 million tweets containing the green-and-yellow square emojis have been sent.Leading into 2022, the vast majority of tweets around Wordle were coming from New Zealand and Australia — but Twitter shared that the top three countries tweeting about Wordle in recent weeks are the US, the UK, and Canada. Advertisement  But there’s some indication the game is finally moving to other social networks. Last week, several TikTok accounts dedicated to Wordle were created, where users share their results and post memes.
 


And the Kiwi crew who started it all are proud of how they helped the game grow.""I didn't realize we were early adopters; it was just a bunch of people playing a game over summer. But then once the share button was introduced — hats off to Elizabeth for suggesting sharing that way — my Twitter feed is now entirely full of green squares,"" Brislen said. ""I can well understand why some people get angsty about it, as it's gone nuts. But just learn to mute keywords, OK, people?""Here are some tips, techniques, and opening word suggestions from some of Wordle’s earliest adopters:Andrew Chen: “I like to use ‘TIMES’ as a starting word because it has an ‘S’ at the end to quickly tell you if it's a plural word or not. I think there is a general consensus that starting words with lots of vowels are good for narrowing down the number of possible words. There's folks out there who have done analyses of the 2,500 words in the Wordle answer dictionary and determined what the ‘best’ starting words are. But I'd like to think that there are no bad starting words, that everyone can have fun whatever way they like.”Paul Brislen: “My average suggests I need more help than I can give. Usually takes me five guesses to get there, while my wife does them in three. Ugh. Use the ‘FORCE’ (a good five-letter word), try a different starter word each day, remember that what worked yesterday won't tomorrow, and don't forget that double letters are allowed (bloody ‘CLOCK’ ruined my streak).”Asher Wilson-Goldman: “I use ‘SPELT’ as my opening word and love it. It provides a good range of letters while keeping ‘R’ and ‘A’ spare to provide good follow-up word options. I know a lot of people advocate starting with words with three or four vowels, but I think they're wrong — it's much easier to guess vowels than consonants because there are fewer of them.”Thomas Beagle: “I like varying my starting words. One day I'm going to get that elusive first-guess winner! My advice is that you don't have to try to get the answer on every guess; sometimes it's better to ignore the letters you've already got and guess a word with five new letters.”

67,Omicron has been described as mild. People with disabilities say they've never been more at risk.,"


Kayle Hill hasn’t left her apartment since Dec. 27. A 25-year-old disabled person, she’s taking isolation more seriously than ever before to avoid exposure to the contagious Omicron variant of COVID. She’s stopped her practice of making short visits to local spots, only goes outside to occasionally pick up curbside deliveries, and will miss a medical appointment to address pain this month.While nondisabled people may be calmed by the idea that Omicron is a less severe version of COVID, the threat of a highly transmissible version of a deadly infection is as scary as ever for people with weakened immune systems. And recent comments by top COVID leadership that flippantly passed over the very real threat COVID still poses to immunocompromised people were met with frustration from people like Hill. Advertisement     “It terrifies me to my core,” Hill said of this phase of the pandemic. “As immunocompromised people can never be sure that their body responded sufficiently to the vaccine, many of us — while so incredibly thankful for the vaccine and the layer of protection it provides — have to live as though we are in a pre-vaccine world.”Hill lives with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and degenerative disc disease in her back, as well as rheumatoid arthritis, for which she takes an immunosuppressant. She told BuzzFeed News it’s “absurd” that Omicron has been hailed as a “milder” version of the virus while she considers this time to be the most dangerous phase of the pandemic yet for the roughly 7 million immunocompromised people in the US.
 


The CDC has recommended that moderately or severely immunocompromised people receive a fourth shot of the COVID vaccine in 2022. But the sheer rapidity of the spread of Omicron has posed a very real immediate threat for people with immunosuppressive conditions because they can get sick more easily and are more likely to develop severe illness. A healthy immune response to the vaccine is needed to create protective antibodies, and therefore vaccines are less likely to be effective in people who are immunocompromised.People who live with a disability, chronic illness, or other immunosuppressive conditions have shared their message on social media that managing their risk shouldn’t only be up to them, using the #MyDisabledLifeIsWorthy hashtag started by disability activist Imani Barbarin.They have also adopted extreme protective measures to prevent COVID exposure, such as canceling or missing medical appointments, quitting jobs, or staying at home in self-imposed lockdown.“There’s no such thing as too cautious at this point if we want to protect chronically ill or disabled people,” Hill said.When she moved to Waterbury, Connecticut, in 2020, Hill struggled to find a pain management medical team that worked with Medicaid. But then she finally got a job with private insurance, found a new doctor, got an MRI, and was suggested a pain treatment plan involving occasional injections.“I was thrilled,” Hill said. “I was really looking forward to it.”But as the number of COVID cases rose in Waterbury, Hill decided to cancel the Jan. 19 appointment — she couldn’t risk exposure in the small waiting room that on previous visits had been very crowded.After she canceled, Hill broke down in tears knowing that she’d have to continue living in pain despite overcoming so many other barriers to getting the healthcare she needs.
 


Hill said she has “a lot of anger” toward the government because it has few plans of action other than widespread vaccination to combat COVID. While getting a shot is effective for people who don't have a disability, she said, it’s not possible for people like her to ever feel totally sure their body responded effectively to the vaccine. The government needs to back up vaccination with other elements, such as mask mandates and limited capacity in public spaces, she said, or else people with weakened immunity must continue living in fear of potentially severe infection.“With so few other mitigation strategies in place, community spread is beyond what we’ve seen before, again leaving immunocompromised people in a particularly vulnerable situation,” Hill said.Last week, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in an interview with Good Morning America that it was reassuring news that most of the people dying of Omicron were those with multiple comorbidities, or preexisting conditions.“Over 75% of deaths occurred in people with at least four comorbidities, so really these are people who are unwell to begin with,” Walensky said. “Really encouraging news in the context of Omicron.”But what sounds encouraging to a nondisabled person navigating the pandemic can actually mean an increased danger for people like Hill if it leads to the general public acting more recklessly.And exercising caution has put immunocompromised people in the balance of deciding which elements of healthcare they’re willing to put off to avoid a higher risk of exposure to COVID.“If I were to skip an infusion, my disease would become active and I’d end up hospitalized,” said Tessa Miller, a Brooklyn-based health journalist and author who is chronically ill. Miller lives with Crohn’s disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease where the immune system attacks the digestive tract. She also has celiac disease, an immune response to gluten that can also damage the small intestine.
 


Miller receives immunosuppressant infusions every six weeks at a chemotherapy center, and even though COVID is a risk, she said she can’t skip the appointments because they keep her chronic illness in check. Miller decided to put off other medical treatments, though, including seeing a neurologist to treat migraines caused by the infusion treatment until COVID cases go down.“Being hospitalized right now is my worst nightmare, not just because of the risk of COVID, but because the system is entirely overwhelmed and I don’t want to add to that,” she said.People with disabilities or chronic illnesses are “tired” from the pandemic, Miller said, adding that the CDC’s COVID messaging — though it hasn’t surprised her — treats disabled people as “disposable.”“If the pandemic has revealed anything, it’s that the economy comes before all else and that we should be willing to die for it,” Miller said. “It’s not only saying ‘We didn’t consider chronically ill and disabled people when we created these guidelines,’ but ‘We also don’t care if you die.’”Miller hasn’t socialized since February 2020. She didn’t experience a return to public transit rides or long-awaited vacations as nondisabled people have postvaccination. She said her world just feels “smaller and lonelier.”If chronically ill and disabled people had been sought for guidance from the start of the pandemic, she said there would have been more stringent measures to limit the virus’s spread. She said officials would have done things like pay people to stay home or get vaccinated, make remote work a standard, provide universal childcare, and study the long-term effects of COVID to anticipate a new group of people with disabilities.“We don’t know how else to say that our lives are worth living and that we’re worth listening to,” Miller said. “Had chronically ill and disabled people been looked to for guidance and leadership from the start of the pandemic, I can guarantee we’d be in a lot better shape than we are now.” Advertisement     Nondisabled people may find solace in sharing the idea that everyone will contract Omicron at some point so it can’t be that bad. But to Rumor Noelle, this is like saying to immunocompromised people that they should be getting ready for severe illness or death.Noelle, a 26-year-old full-time student in Hampton, New Hampshire, said it’s “extremely inaccessible” to even get a COVID test if you don't have a disability. Since they are living with cerebral palsy, someone has to drive them to get a PCR test, and home tests are extremely expensive given how much they’re already paying for medication and medical bills.
 


Noelle sees about seven doctors a month, but when they saw reports that some medical professionals were testing positive, they canceled appointments for January with a pain specialist and a surgery consultation to address pain in their legs and arms. Now they’ll have to buy extra pain relievers and ice packs until they can get another appointment.“As that gets worse, I still have to worry about what happens if I get COVID,” Noelle said, adding that it’s frustrating that people with disabilities even have to use a hashtag as a reminder they deserve to live.The only time Noelle leaves home is to go to their job as a receptionist — a job they started in December after giving up a previous position at a crowded restaurant due to the higher risk of COVID exposure. Now they’re considering quitting again because coworkers have come to the office with COVID symptoms. But leaving a job is scary, Noelle said, because it’s difficult to find an employer that will accommodate frequent medical appointments.“Disabled people have been right about everything in this pandemic,” Noelle said. “Everyone's a little desensitized and too OK with disabled people’s deaths. … It’s like we’re sacrificing disabled people to make room for the new disabled people who are here because of long COVID and COVID in general.” Advertisement     Peter Morley, 52, has lived with chronic pain and illnesses for 15 years, including lupus, and is a kidney cancer survivor. The New York–based patient advocate has left home as little as possible during the pandemic and has missed or rescheduled myriad medical appointments because he said he feels “too vulnerable” to COVID in a hospital setting.
 


“I have reprioritized my health issues and appointments, something I would never do pre-COVID-19,” Morley said.He’s overdue for an endoscopy for liver disease, which can only be done by a hepatologist at a hospital. But like Hill, Morley said he feared narrow corridors and other closed spaces in the hospital with people who could potentially be unvaccinated, aren’t masked, or aren’t social distancing.When he gets stressed about taking care of his body, “my diseases act accordingly,” Morley said. If his mental health triggers some of his conditions, it could lead to hospitalization, so he’s working with a therapist remotely, something he said not everyone in his position can access.“And it’s not just us that it terrifies — our caregivers are just as alarmed,” Morley said. “We are children, parents, grandparents, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, and we are your neighbors. We are not statistics.”

68,The Biden administration is finally sending Americans free at-home COVID tests. Here’s how you can get one.,"


The Biden administration announced Friday that it will double its supply of coronavirus rapid tests to a total of 1 billion and make those tests freely available online for every American household.Beginning Jan. 18, Americans can visit COVIDtests.gov to order up to four rapid tests per household (officials originally said ordering would be available Jan.19, but instead it went live a day early).The move comes as the US struggles with soaring COVID-19 cases caused chiefly by the Omicron variant, which has smashed case count and hospitalization records nationwide.Tests will be free. The only information required for purchase is a name and mailing address. But officials estimated that the tests would not ship until 7–12 days after purchase, meaning the soonest they could arrive in homes is Jan. 26. Advertisement     In early December, the Biden administration unveiled a winter strategy for the Omicron variant, focusing on more people getting boosters, more vaccinations for school-age kids, as well as requirements for private insurers to pay for at-home tests. Later in the month, Biden announced plans to open 20,000 free testing sites and to send federal medical teams to assist overloaded hospitals, which are now being deployed.But the requirement for private insurers to cover at-home tests does not go into effect until Jan. 15, meaning it has not helped pay for rapid tests during the holiday Omicron surge. The administration also came under fire as at-home test supplies ran short on pharmacy shelves over the holidays as Omicron cases skyrocketed. This led to the first plans to make 500 million free tests available to Americans, followed by Friday’s doubling of that figure.Nam Tran, a professor of clinical pathology at the University of California, Davis, said he welcomed Friday’s announcement and noted that any expansion of testing is good news, but he cautioned that people need to remember how to test appropriately. “We shouldn't be just testing out of overall anxiety concern, we should be testing for good reasons,” he said.According to the CDC, rapid tests should be used if you have COVID symptoms, if you’ve been in close contact with someone who has COVID, or if you will be gathering indoors with someone who is either at high risk for severe disease or is unvaccinated.But if you’re asymptomatic, Tran said, it’s critical to test more than once, at least 36 hours apart. “Testing multiple times, over time, allows you to catch the virus when it reaches that level that becomes detectable,” he said. This means the four tests per household would only be enough to get a meaningful result for two asymptomatic people. In symptomatic individuals, Tran said, the viral load is likely high enough that one test should be sufficient to tell if that person is infectious.
"
70,"In the second season of Netflix’s Cheer, we see an even uglier side of the sport.","


When the first season of the Netflix docuseries Cheer debuted in January 2020, it was a commercial and critical hit. The show, about a group of cheerleaders at Navarro Junior College in Corsicana, Texas, and their coach, Monica Aldama, put the tremendous hard work and athleticism of cheerleaders on full display.But while the show challenged people’s perceptions of how much effort goes into cheerleading, it also veered into precarious myths of toxic positivity, with its emphasis on young people sacrificing their bodies for the sake of the team. And most jarring of all was the October 2020 arrest of fan-favorite Jerry Harris for alleged sexual assault. Advertisement     Given this context, it’s surprising that the series’ creator and executive producer, Greg Whiteley, opted to do a second season of the show. “I am a huge believer in the power of stories and telling them honestly,” Whiteley said this past December when it was announced that the show would be returning. “I believe the story is going to ultimately be the best version of itself when you are honoring what is true, and you’re not running from it.” The second season, out today, is evenly split between the Navarro College cheerleaders and their rivals, the underdogs at Trinity Valley College, who reside about 45 minutes down the road in Athens, Texas, and are coached by Javontae Johnson.While the dramatic stakes are compelling and we see the return of familiar faces — including the self-assured La’Darius Marshall; the tumbler Lexi Brumback, who appears to be enjoying the various income opportunities of fame; and the all-star Gabi Butler — there’s a sense of unease that permeates the season because of the real-life criminal charges against Harris, who appears throughout the first half of the season. Harris, 22, was charged with one count of producing child sexual abuse images and for allegedly soliciting nudes from minors in October 2020; he was hit with subsequent charges just months later. (Harris denied the accusations in a statement to ABC News in September 2020, but when questioned by authorities he allegedly admitted to sexually assaulting a 15-year-old in 2019. He has been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago since his arrest in September 2020 and no trial date has been set.)One episode halfway through the season, titled “Jerry,” is solely about the allegations and includes on-camera interviews with the victims of his alleged abuse and their mother. Harris’s former teammates frequently express shock, saying they never would have guessed he could commit such crimes.But given how the show depicts competitive cheerleading, it’s not hard to imagine how this sort of behavior would have flown under the radar. Aldama and her assistant coaches are frequently dismissive of the athletes' feelings. When cheerleaders who train hard for months only to not make mat (qualifying for the team that will perform at finals) are reasonably disappointed, Aldama is quick to shut down their chatter from the sidelines because they’re “being so negative,” as she says in one episode. The culture of toxic positivity, of always needing to put on a brave or smiling face and perfect their routine for the sake of the team, could make athletes feel uncomfortable speaking up about abuse. Advertisement     In the episode addressing the impact of Harris’s allegations on the lives of his former teammates, a Good Morning America clip plays. Aldama appears on a video call with the other contestants joining her for Season 29 of Dancing With the Stars. Meant to be a surprise, the morning show’s host cuts to Harris, who appears onscreen, hyping his coach up with his high-pitched voice and infectious enthusiasm. “Congratulations, Monica!” Harris screeches. “I’m so, so happy for you. I can’t wait to vote for you every week.” The former cheerleader’s spirited disposition is disarming, and from the many clips shown, this is pretty much the only side we see of him, save for the instances where he discusses his difficult upbringing.While it might be tough for some to imagine how a person with such a seemingly bright personality could be the source of pain for younger, more impressionable athletes participating in the sport, this dynamic is not uncommon when it comes to abuse. The episode where twin brothers Sam and Charlie tell their story explores how the public perception of Harris almost prevented them from coming forward. “[Harris] messaged me on my private Instagram account on his private Instagram account and like basically just saying, ‘Hey,’ and he asked how old I was,” Charlie says in the episode, recounting an incident that he says occurred during his first cheerleading season in December 2018. “And I told him that I was 13 and then after that, right off the bat, he asked me, ‘Can I have butt pics?’” At the time, Harris was 19.The episode captures how difficult it can be for sexual assault victims, especially minors, to speak out. Charlie and Sam knew of Harris long before he started messaging them on Snapchat because he was a rising star on one of their favorite cheer teams. They didn’t want to tell their story, at least at first, because it meant they would be ostracized by their peers, people who looked up to Harris. “It made me lose even more faith, I guess, in like just having a safe community in cheer,” Sam said, right after his brother said Harris cornered him in a bathroom during a practice event, demanding sex. Even after being charged with these crimes, Harris still exudes a puzzling optimism. His lawyers, according to Netflix, declined to be interviewed on camera, but Aldama said Harris wrote her a letter saying one day he hoped to become a motivational speaker. If convicted, Harris faces a minimum 15-year prison sentence.Throughout this season, it feels like Cheer is trying to toe the line between telling hard, uncomfortable truths about the sport of competitive cheerleading while also being inspirational television. In Season 1, you could actively applaud the Navarro team and its dedication to the sport, looking past the injuries the athletes sustained and the broken homes they escaped to make their dreams a reality. But Season 2, which was shot in 2020 and 2021, before and then during the pandemic, it feels icky to witness. Advertisement     Observing the young cheerleaders push past their breaking point and, even worse, seeing how the coaches poorly handle their emotions when it comes to the athletes’ needs illuminates the overwhelming stress of the sport. “So TT’s out until next Tuesday,” Aldama says in Episode 3’s “Dracut Girl,” referring to a stunter, visibly annoyed by the delays this will cause for the team’s tight practice schedule. “Seems extreme,” she says, right before briefly walking outside of the gym because she needed a “new attitude.” TT’s exact ailment isn’t addressed, but there’s an acknowledgment that he has had “headaches.” That Aldama doesn’t seem sympathetic to his pain is concerning.Understandably, no one handles their emotions well every single time, and Aldama and the assistants are human like anyone else, but as the season continues, you begin to pick up on several instances where the leaders come across as cold and indifferent to various dilemmas pertaining to the cheerleaders. Even when it comes to the emotional needs of the cheerleaders, it often feels like the coaches don’t think about how their decisions impact players. There’s another scene in that same episode where newcomer Maddy is replaced in a stunt routine without a proper heads-up about the abrupt switch. Moments later, she breaks down crying. “How did I go from being center stunt to not being there at all?” she asks Aldama through tears. “I could’ve gotten, like, a warning before practice.” It doesn’t feel like the cheerleader’s concerns are adequately validated, as everything — even minor expressions of dissent — comes back to the needs of the team. “If we make a decision that I feel is best for the team, I need you to support that, all right?” Aldama says.While watching Cheer, you will undoubtedly marvel at the incredible stunts the athletes are able to pull off, and you’ll likely tear up when listening to some of the neophytes talk about their journey into the sport, as well as their hopes and dreams for after. But the darker side of cheer makes for tough viewing. As the pandemic continues, some athletes question whether it was worth it to leave their hometowns for the chance to train at Navarro. By the end of the season, some choose not to return. Cheer will likely be a hit for Netflix once again, but this time it’s harder to find anyone to root for. ●

71,"As an It-Girl in the early 2000s, Tara Reid was pummeled by the press for partying and plastic surgery. Now, she wants to move on.","


As soon as we met, Tara Reid said she had brought me something. She pulled a small orange satchel from her pocket and handed it to me. “I made it myself. I picked every bead,” she said. Inside was a friendship bracelet made with turquoise, silver, and little rivets etched with words like “Beautiful” and “Believe.” She advised me to put it under moonlight to charge the crystals with good energy. Reid, like a lot of women who spent their entire adult lives living and working in Hollywood, is a little witchy, a little woo-woo, not that there’s anything wrong with that.We spoke over the course of a few days in Los Angeles, while the now-46-year-old actor was shooting a lookbook for her new sunglasses line, Cult Queen, and a handbag made in collaboration with designer Michael Kuluva. Before the shoot, she was reserved, almost sleepy, but when the photographer lifted the camera to her sightline, she popped out her leg, offered a smile, and for hours, turned on the charm that made her successful in the first place.This is the kind of behavior one might expect from an actor whose early breakout roles cemented her as an approachable bombshell and America’s Next Sweetheart. In 1998 she played Bunny Lebowski, a former porn star trophy wife who shops constantly, in the cult classic The Big Lebowski. In 1999, she was Vicky in the megahit teen comedy American Pie (and a few sequels), the quintessential girl next door who’s unsure if she really wants to have sex for the first time with her idiot boyfriend. Advertisement  But my favorite — and Reid’s — was her role in 2001’s Josie and the Pussycats. I always loved Melody, the band’s dim but sweet drummer. In the Archie Comics that inspired the film, she’s sidelined to punchlines where she isn’t even in on the joke — everyone thought Melody was an idiot, and they treated her as such, but she was actually just a perennial optimist. And Reid was the perfect vessel for such a character. “Everyone thought she was clueless, but she was actually really smart,” Reid told me.Josie and the Pussycats might have looked and smelled like a typical coming-of-age movie, but it was actually an incisive, brutal commentary on toxic media culture and how easy it is to lose yourself in the fame machine. Who better understands that cycle than Reid? “No matter what I do, even if I stopped acting tomorrow, I’m going to be famous for the rest of my life,” she said. “It wasn’t like I cared about being famous. It just all kind of happened.”At the dawn of the 2000s, Tara Reid was the quintessential It girl: a bankable, beautiful, blonde actor with sparkling blue eyes, perfect for rom-coms and gross-out comedies. But just a couple of years later, the shine had already started to wear off. There were fewer starring roles, in similar horny-slapstick movies (2002’s college comedy Van Wilder, 2003’s hijinks-heavy rom-com My Boss’s Daughter). When even those disappeared, she showed up on reality shows like Hell’s Kitchen and Celebrity Big Brother.
 


Like so many Hollywood women of the era — Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears — Reid’s career and reputation suffered in her early 20s when she hit the party circuit and became known for tabloid photos of her outside Hollywood clubs wearing low-rise jeans and chainmail halter tops. But there are big differences between Reid and her contemporaries: Namely, she never really found herself embroiled in any major scandal. “Yeah, I partied and had fun,” she told me. “We’d pop bottles of champagne. But who doesn’t?”There is no Tara Reid mugshot, no Tara Reid DUI, no Tara Reid prison sentence. “They all were in jail, they all did fucking sex tapes, crazy shit,” Reid said, referring to some of her peers. She said she never got in trouble on movie sets and was always on time. (The only story about her being late to a set is from 2018, when she was removed from a flight for causing a “disturbance,” making her three hours late to filming 5th Borough.) “There’s nothing like that about me,” she said. But it didn’t really matter — soon, perception became reality.If you ask Reid, her reputation as a party girl coincided with her reputation as a professional flake, two things she considers patently false. Elevated publications largely ignored her — she might’ve been on the cover of Maxim and Playboy and FHM, but that attention never really transferred to more roles or more respectability. Soon, her body was endlessly dissected by gossip magazines, with zoomed-in photos of her legs and abs picked apart by bloggers and readers alike.
 


Anyone who’s had their body criticized by a cruel audience, even an audience of just one, can empathize. But Reid hasn’t had her large-scale redemption narrative even as the media has reconsidered narratives about many young white women who were famous in the aughts. Maybe that’s because her story isn’t tragic in the extreme: She’s alive, well, and still working. Monica Lewinsky had her name splashed across every major newspaper in the world, while Spears had to fight for control of even the smallest part of her own life. In comparison, what did Reid endure, apart from the vagaries of fame? The world moved on; maybe she just didn’t suffer enough. Still, the way the media treated women like Reid serves as a kind of allegory for the sexist, targeted, and unjustified ways women have historically been treated.Reid isn’t bitter, but she’d have a right to be. In her 20s, she was primed to be the next big thing, but instead the roles dried up. She tolerated more cruelty than any one person should. Yet, having survived the worst of 2000s tabloid culture, Reid barely wants so much as an apology. “I don’t want people to feel sorry for me,” she said. “I don’t want people to think I’m hung up on that.”As far as she’s concerned, she doesn’t actually require redemption, whether for her sense of self-worth or her career. The way the tabloids talked about her is old news. She hasn’t made any attempt to publicly rewrite her own narrative. She isn’t writing a memoir or trying to sit down with Oprah. She’s simply been working, now producing more than acting, and living a quieter life.But hasn’t she earned an apology? Because, for all the vitriol directed at her, when it comes down to it, Reid only did two things: publicly enjoyed her 20s and altered her body in a way people didn’t approve of. Neither would have ruined her life had the public not reacted so strongly. Her peers are getting absolution. So why can’t she get a break?
 


The current revival of early-aughts fashion — Von Dutch hats and denim skirts like the ones she used to wear to Hyde Lounge — brings back a more personal element of Reid’s troubles with the tabloids. “When I see things people wear sometimes, it reminds me of my mother,” she said. “It’s a very melancholy feeling. She was great. She was a boss.”Reid’s mother died four years ago, and her father around two years before that, but she was always close to them, even after moving from her native New Jersey to Hollywood in the late ‘90s, when she was 20. The media response to her personal life hit them the hardest. “My mom would say it wasn’t fair. She said, ‘I’m going to call these motherfuckers, tell them off,’” Reid said. “She was more angry than I was. She didn’t want to be judged by her friends, by me looking bad. If I could have fixed it, I would have, but it wasn’t up to me at the time.”If she had become famous now, Reid’s partygoing might look like run-of-the-mill celebrity carousing. But in the aughts, it made her a tabloid fixture. Every night out, every relationship, and every change to her body was examined and derided ad nauseam. She was a TMZ and Perez Hilton mainstay — TMZ called her “Franken-nipple” and a “train wreck,” and ran videos making fun of her for being denied entry to clubs, while Perez Hilton covered a clothing line she was working on in a post called “Hookers Rejoice!” It was the era of Britney Spears being photographed without underwear on and Paris Hilton’s sex tape. If gossip blogs needed someone to shit on that afternoon, famous young women were perfect targets.Celebrity bloggers were quick to post close-ups of every trail of cellulite on Reid’s body, every fold on her midsection. Page Six routinely zeroed in on photos of her chest, her stomach, her butt, criticizing every fold and crease. In 2004, she went pre–social media viral when the top of her dress slipped and exposed her breast while she was at a party hosted by P. Diddy. “Tara Reid: Holy Lopsided Boobs!” proclaimed Just Jared in 2007, about red-carpet photos of the starlet smiling placidly in a green dress. In 2008, she received negative attention for paparazzi shots of her in a bikini at the beach, which showed scars left over from a fumbled liposuction procedure. (The scars aren’t that extreme, but the response was so aggressive and swift, you would’ve thought she’d had a head transplant.) “It’s a ghastly, protruding thing, isn’t it?” Lainey Lui wrote on Lainey Gossip in 2011 about Reid’s midsection. “Like it might detach from her and start killing things. Part leather, part plastic, all gross.” Advertisement  
 


Too thin and she was accused of having anorexia, but even rumors of surgical adjustments earned sneering, as if trying to evade mockery was equally worthy of derision. And the more insulting headlines she had to tolerate, the fewer roles she felt like she was being offered. She’s still trying to sort through the consequences. “Why would that affect me so much, especially when there’s never ever been an article about me being unprofessional?”Meanwhile, she was certainly making money for a lot of other people. “When I hosted [TMZ], Harvey [Levin] came up to me and goes, ‘We wouldn’t even have TMZ if it wasn’t for you. You were always the one that was picked on. For us, it was perfect,’” she said. “It wasn’t for me.” (Levin did not respond to requests for comment.) Bloggers like Perez built their own empires on such cruelty. “I found out we had the same publicist, and I [said to the publicist], ‘You’re not protecting me. Everything I tell you, are you telling him?’” she said. “I think he’s the one that ruined my career, to be honest with you.” Advertisement  In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Perez said he didn’t think they ever shared the same publicist, and he denied ever receiving tips about Reid from former or current publicists. But he still couldn’t help himself. “I’m sorry for my past coverage of Tara Reid,” he said. “I could have covered her then-sloppiness and problematic behavior with more empathy.”There are a lot of things Reid doesn’t want to talk about, but the biggest one is speculation about cosmetic surgery. (Before the interview, her publicist asked that I not ask any specific questions about what cosmetic work she has or hasn’t had done, though she was willing to discuss the impact of the tabloid coverage of her body.)In the early aughts, she reportedly received two cosmetic procedures that drastically changed her body in ways she now says she didn’t want. Her breast implants were bigger than what she originally wanted (she said she asked for B cups but received C's instead), and body contouring left her with a midsection she once called “the most ripply, bulgy thing.” She seems protective of herself and her choices, which makes sense considering how often she’s had to defend how she looks. “It was a terrible experience and everyone kept throwing it in my face,” she said. “Like, why are you being so mean?”She figured her options were to either fade away entirely, or to try a new type of public life. While the tabloids were picking her apart, Reid turned to reality TV, the dominion of stars whose A-list status has evaporated. There was the 2005 E! docuseries Taradise, where Reid tried out local cuisine and nightlife in places like Greece, Italy, and Monaco. Reid liked making it but recognizes it probably affirmed the misconceptions about her. Advertisement  
 


“That’s where, really, I think the party girl image came,” she said. “I didn’t realize that would actually hurt me. I thought it would be fun.” There was a 2011 stint on Celebrity Big Brother in the UK, alongside Irish celebrity twins Jedward and David Hasselhoff’s ex-wife, Pamela. Then, in 2016, she appeared on Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars with her “boyfriend” Dean May. She was kicked off the show on the finale when it was revealed that they weren’t a real couple. (Reid declined to discuss the scandal in our interview.)In 2008, she spent two weeks at the Promises Treatment Center, and to outsiders, it seemed like Reid was there to get sober. She said that wasn’t the truth either. “I was dating a guy at the time, he was very destructive. I couldn’t get away from him,” she said. The relationship was so abusive, she said, that her team sent her to rehab to break them up. “The only way was to go to treatment. Everyone thought I had a real problem, and that was the problem.”Reid never wavers in her eye contact when she talks; there’s no insincerity in her delivery. “No one knows the real truth about all the things that happened. This doesn’t even bother me, because I know my truth, but it used to.” Reid talks low and slow, forcing you to lean in to hear her clearly. “How long can you be angry about something?”
 


People who know Reid well paint a vastly different portrait of her than the tabloids did. Twenty years after Josie and the Pussycats, Reid still considers costar Rachael Leigh Cook one of her good friends. Cook was supposed to be a bridesmaid at Reid’s wedding to Carson Daly before it was called off in 2001 — a breakup that tabloids and Daly attributed to Reid’s partying. “To some extent, I dodged a bullet,” Daly told Elle in 2012 in an article titled “I’m Living Proof That the Good Guys Win.” “I was getting serious about my career, and she wanted to shoot movies and just party in her time off.” (Reid didn’t have as much to say about Daly: “We grew apart,” she told me. “We love each other, we care about each other, but I know I can’t spend my whole life with you. In some ways, that’s the hardest breakup in the world.”)“I think Tara’s someone who, as strong and as outspoken as she can be when she needs to be, she doesn’t actually like to look backwards,” Cook told me over the phone. “She’s always somebody who’s kept appropriate blinders going forward toward her own best, most positive path and trajectory.”Cook said that she didn’t hang out with the same “fast crowd” that Reid did, and maybe that insulated her from some of the criticisms her friend had to deal with. But the negative attention struck her as unfair. “I don’t know how she ended up as deeply mistreated as she was,” Cook said. “People would say, ‘Oh, she can’t be the sweet innocent person, not if we saw pictures of her coming out of a club in a crop top.’ That’s absurd.”The aughts starlets who survived cruel press vortexes have done it, in part, by seeking to change their public narrative with domesticity. Hilton is a newlywed, Spears and Lohan are both engaged, and Richie has two kids and a decadelong marriage to Joel Madden. Reid never followed suit, though she does have two dogs (Bella and Beso) and a live-in boyfriend of four years. But she didn’t pursue family life in as public a fashion as, say, Hilton, who recently starred in a reality show on Peacock about her wedding. “I think what they really wanted from me to make the next change was to get married and have kids. Now, she’s a woman,” Reid said. “They wanted to see me have a family, and because I didn’t, it was still fair game.” Advertisement  
 


Not that she hasn’t been offered opportunities to retell her story, like Hilton did in 2020’s This Is Paris (where she discussed her trauma after being abused at a boarding school) or Lohan’s 2014 OWN series (which followed her path toward sobriety and attempted career relaunch). “I’ve been offered a million times to do a memoir or a book,” she said. “The reason why I haven’t done it [is] because I’m not over yet. Why now? As Justin Timberlake would say, I don’t need you to cry me a river.”But doesn’t she want some kind of reckoning? I would, if someone had publicly called me “ghetto tits.” Her insistence that she doesn’t feels almost like a reverse defense mechanism: She’s so used to people mocking her that she doesn’t want to ask for too much. To ask for an apology is to take a risk; it’s too intimate and vulnerable a request from people who might still just call her ugly. Advertisement  
 


These days, bloggers like Lainey Gossip and Perez are offering up mea culpas, and it’s no longer socially acceptable to malign a young woman for going out. “Other stars get a little bit crazy now. Jennifer Lawrence fell down the stairs!” Reid said, referring to that Oscars moment in 2013. “She’s doing late-night talk shows, drinking a beer. If I ever did that, I’d be destroyed.” Still, Lawrence recently gave an interview about how she had to disappear from public life because people were getting sick of her and her relatable antics. The culture hasn’t changed that much — if tabloids want to drag a woman, they’ll find a way no matter what.Reid’s story is a case study for what happens when the stardom you’re poised for goes sideways. Now, her relationship with Hollywood and the public is an uneasy one — and no one knows, not even her, what it’ll look like in the future. Advertisement  In fact, a few months after I interviewed Reid, she was once again harangued after posting a photo of herself in a bikini. The comments came in swiftly, thousands of people assessing whether she might have an eating disorder and criticizing whatever she’s done to her body over the years. (Reid has repeatedly denied ever having any type of eating disorder.) “You need help,” one follower said. “Age isn’t everyone’s friend,” another said. Later that day, Reid posted another photo of herself, along with a statement. “Here is another picture from yesterday to show you I am not too skinny. I have a high metabolism. All I do is eat,” she said. “To everyone who wrote something nice and stuck up for me, I love you! And keep spreading that love, it is the only thing that will save this world.”Reid feels like her 20s still color people’s opinions. “Even to this day, there’s still kind of a thing about me,” Reid said. “Come on, guys. You can’t judge me by my high school picture. I’m 45 years old now.” The hope, maybe, is that people get bored of shitting on her. “Eventually it’s going to go away, and it is going away,” she said. “What are they gonna do? Pick on me when I’m 60? I’m a 90-year-old lady and I have a glass in my hand? Fuck off.”
 


If you’ve seen Reid in a movie in the last few years, it was likely one from the Sharknado franchise, the TV movie absurdities about tornados full of sharks. Reid isn’t divorced from how people perceive her, nor does she have highfalutin ideas about her career. When I asked which of her movies were her least favorite, she didn’t stutter: “Some of the stupid movies I do,” she said. “You know. It’s a paycheck.”Before filming the first Sharknado, Reid was living in London, trying to recover from a decade and a half of ruthless media attention. The city was the last spot on the American Pie Reunion promotional tour in 2012, and instead of going home, she stayed. Nothing was tying her to Hollywood anymore — her last big movie, My Boss’s Daughter (a critical bomb), premiered all the way back in 2003, and her seasonlong stint on Scrubs ended in 2005. “I need[ed] to refocus and find myself, my core again. And it worked, I went there and I lived my life,” she said. It was easier — the tabloids let up, and she felt like she could blend in and do whatever she wanted without constant observation.“My agent called me, like, ‘All right, Tara, you’re not working, we’re not doing anything, you need to work again. You need to come home,’” she said. “So then they gave me this craziest, stupidest script I’ve ever read in my whole entire life called Sharknado.”Reid credits it with reviving her career. “It’s the worst movie of all time. It’s so bad that it’s actually kind of good,” she said. “Let’s have a baby in the shark in outer space. It’s so out there. For Sharknado to bring me back is something I never would’ve expected.” Sharknado wasn’t a critical or commercial darling by any means. But the movie was a success all the same: When it premiered in 2013 on Syfy, it had 1.4 million viewers, on a channel with a typical viewership of less than a million. Its third screening a few weeks later got 2.1 million viewers. (Sharknado 2: The Second One, got 3.9 million viewers on a Wednesday night.) With its aggressive commitment to campy terror, Sharknado is now a cult classic that inspires midnight screenings and themed parties. Advertisement     In 2018, The Last Sharknado: It’s About Time came out, marking the end of the franchise. But the Sharknado movies exposed her to a new audience, as evidenced by a recent flight she took from a vacation in Mexico back home to LA. “The flight attendant comes up to me and he goes, ‘Oh my god, I so loved your movie.’ So of course, I automatically think [of] American Pie,” she said. “And he goes, ‘Sharknado is everything.’ I was like, Is this really happening?”
 


Her next project is the forthcoming Masha’s Mushroom, a thriller about an overworked mother who throws a party for her daughter where all the guests end up dosed with a hallucinogen. Reid plays the mother; Vivica A. Fox and Beverly D’Angelo also star. Reid is also a producer on the movie. Even though she decided to get involved in producing because roles for women her age are famously hard to find, she’s excited about it. “If someone’s not gonna give me that chance, then I was like, I gotta make it for myself,” she said. “I found a great script, great director. I’m so proud of what we’ve accomplished.” Finally, she’s on the other side of the Hollywood equation. “It was so funny this time, calling up the agents that said no to me that I’d like to make an offer to your client,” she said. “To reach out to all these different companies and me being the boss this time, it was like, the table’s turned. It was beyond satisfying.” Advertisement     It’s easy to root for Reid when she tells stories like this. She comes off as open and sweet; she ended our interview by proclaiming “I love you!” into my recorder. And while Reid told me, over and over, that she didn’t want or need a reconsideration, I still want one for her. Whether she’s saying it because it’s true or just a line for a culture that has largely scorned her, she does seem exhausted from explaining herself. She’s tried repeatedly to make it clear that she’s productive, settled, kind, and easygoing. It hasn’t worked so far. Appearing in a well-known movie franchise hasn’t proved it. Refusing to engage in criticism of her body hasn’t either. Wanting to be understood has only led to disappointment, so why not forget about it? Vindication isn’t everything. What could anyone do to make amends? Cry her a river, and then what?Reid has little time for regrets. “I wonder what else I would’ve done,” she said. “Do I take it back? No, I don’t. It’s who I am.”●

72,Novak Djokovic lost his chance to compete in the Australian Open after a battle with the country’s immigration officials over whether he should be exempt from COVID-19 vaccination requirements.,"


Novak Djokovic, the top-ranked men’s tennis player in the world, left Australia on Sunday and lost his chance to compete in the Australian Open after a battle with the country’s immigration officials over whether he should be exempt from COVID-19 vaccination requirements.The tournament begins Monday, and Djokovic had traveled to the country under a visa that granted him a medical exemption from being vaccinated because he had recently recovered from COVID. But after public outcry from Australians, who have faced stringent border restrictions and lockdowns during the pandemic, his visa was canceled Jan. 6. Advertisement     After back-and-forth within Australia’s judicial system, Djokovic on Sunday lost his final chance to legally remain in the country when a federal court upheld Immigration Minister Alex Hawke’s decision to cancel Djokovic’s visa “in the public interest.” Hawke tweeted Sunday that Djokovic had left Australia, and photographs showed him at Melbourne Airport, where he reportedly boarded a flight to Dubai.“Australia’s strong border protection policies have kept us safe during the pandemic, resulting in one of the lowest death rates, strongest economic recoveries, and highest vaccination rates in the world,” Hawke said in a statement.
 


Hawke added that 91.6% of Australians over age 16 have now been fully vaccinated, and only because of the country’s vaccination program have some international travel restrictions been lifted. Australia banned international travel for much of the pandemic, and it has begun allowing travel only since November for people who are fully vaccinated or who fit into a series of specific exemptions.“Australians have made great sacrifices to get to this point and the Morrison Government is firmly committed to protecting this position, as the Australian people expect,” Hawke said.In a statement, Djokovic said he was “extremely disappointed” by the decision. Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić told reporters he believed the decision was political and described it as a witch hunt.Djokovic had been poised to compete for what could have been a record-breaking 21st Grand Slam title at the Australian Open.

“Happy birthday to my beautiful granddaughter Chicago!!!!” she wrote. “You have the sweetest spirit and always have the cutest little smile on your face with the softest little voice and your precious laughter lights up wherever you are!”
 


Kris had chosen a sweet black-and-white photobooth pic of her cuddling Chicago for the post’s main image.
 


In the pic, the trio are smiling for the camera as they pose outside — with Kim holding her daughter and Kris placing an affectionate hand on Chicago’s back.
 


They were the first photos of herself that Khloé had posted since ex Tristan Thompson’s paternity scandal, which saw him publicly apologizing to her after admitting to fathering a baby son with personal trainer Maralee Nichols.
 


However, this is far from her first rodeo when it comes to photo-editing discourse.
 


""The photo that was posted this week is beautiful,"" Khloé wrote. ""But as someone who has struggled with body image her whole life, when someone takes a photo of you that isn't flattering in bad lighting or doesn't capture your body the way it is after working so hard to get it to this point — and then shares it to the world — you should have every right to ask for it to not be shared.""

74,The much-anticipated return of Ghostface has already been a huge success — could more Scream sequels be on the way?,"The much-anticipated return of Ghostface has already been a huge success, with Scream swiping the top spot at the box office from Marvel juggernaut No Way Home. The legendary slasher franchise returned to screens for the first time in more than a decade and has almost immediately earned more domestically than its predecessor's entire theatrical run. Critics and fans alike have already lauded the return of the franchise, with Scream receiving some of its highest scores to date on Rotten Tomatoes. With a strong outing in its first weekend, Scream was able to topple No Way Home from its perch, after the Marvel movie had dominated the box office since December. With the early success of Scream, there's already talk amongst fans that further sequels could be in the works, particularly as there were reportedly plans for a follow-up to Scream 4 that were shelved following its poor performance. And it seems that the clear appetite for the genre could see a revival for slasher movies in general, with producer Jason Blum hinting at several potential projects. But another important win for Scream is its success in the face of the ongoing pandemic, which has seen many movies bomb at the box office as audiences continue to be hesitant about returning to theaters in the face of surging COVID-19 cases."

76,"Contrary to popular belief, Kylie Jenner is still pregnant.","According to her latest selfie, Kylie Jenner is still pregnant. It was a busy weekend for the Kardashian/Jenner family, who all gathered at Kylie’s home on Saturday to celebrate the fourth birthdays of Kylie and Kim Kardashian’s respective daughters, Stormi and Chicago. Taking a quick break from the festivities, Kylie went to the mirror in her hallway to flaunt her bubblegum pink jumpsuit and matching overcoat. However, it was her growing baby bump that stole the show. If you’ve been keeping up with the Kardashian/Jenners in recent months, you’ll be well aware that these selfies mark a significant turning point in a detailed fan theory that Kylie has secretly given birth. And before you question the legitimacy of this conspiracy, it's important that we remind ourselves of what social media sleuths are capable of. So, cast your mind back to August last year, when TikTok user @EmilyCShwartz shared a theory that Kylie — who famously hid her first pregnancy in 2017 and 2018 — was hiding a pregnancy for the second time. As you may remember, the whole thing started after a number of fans noticed that Kylie’s nail color in her Instagram post marking her 24th birthday did not match the brief glimpse of her manicure that was shown in Kim’s Instagram story shared on the same day. At the time, Kylie continued sharing prefilmed videos of her flat tummy on social media in an attempt to silence the speculation. But — as we now know — her efforts were no match for the TikTok detectives, and she officially announced her pregnancy a few weeks later on Sept. 8. And so, while the eventual announcement of Kylie’s second pregnancy was surrounded by secrecy, fans were still able to pick up on certain clues to calculate that baby number 2 is due to arrive any day now. Which brings us to today. So, acclaimed TikTok sleuth @EmilyCShwartz recently returned with yet another conspiracy about Kylie’s second pregnancy — this time theorizing that she’s secretly given birth already. The theory begins by establishing the most important piece of information: When is the baby even due? As we previously discussed, the exact timeline of the pregnancy is difficult to determine. However, Emily pointed out that there is reason to believe Kylie was aware of her second pregnancy on Apr. 23, when the Keeping Up With the Kardashians reunion was filmed. If you’ve watched the episodes, you might remember that the KarJenners each took a shot of tequila — except for Kylie who, upon further inspection, can be seen holding the shot to her mouth without actually drinking the alcohol. And so, basic math suggests that if Kylie knew she was pregnant in mid-April, her due date would have been in the last week of December at the latest, meaning that it’s not out of the question to assume that she would have given birth by now. With this vital piece of information at the core of the theory, fans grew even more suspicious on Dec. 24 when Kylie was noticeably absent from the Kardashian/Jenner’s annual Christmas Eve party, where the rest of her famous family were seen celebrating in style. Whether Kylie sat out because she was heavily pregnant or nursing a newborn is still up for debate, but despite her mom seemingly not attending, Kylie’s daughter was present. Little Stormi was filmed enjoying the festivities with her cousins, and interestingly was the only attendee who was wearing a mask — perhaps suggesting that her household is taking strict precautions to protect a newborn. Nonetheless, time ticked on, and we were provided with our first piece of tangible evidence just two days later. On Dec. 26, Kourtney Kardashian’s fiancé, Travis Barker, perhaps leaked the best piece of evidence yet, after he shared a photograph on his Instagram story which had a pink-rimmed Comotomo newborn bottle in shot. It wasn’t long before eagle-eyed fans noticed the potential clue, and pointed out that while Kris Jenner has a lot of grandchildren, they’re all too old to be using such a bottle. Some particularly observant detectives even realized that it was the same brand that Kylie used for Stormi when she was born. The plot thickened once again on Dec. 29, when a celebrity nail technician shared close-up photographs of Kylie’s freshly manicured nails, which were noticeably shorter than her usual style. Fans were quick to notice a correlation, theorizing that she trimmed down her signature extensions to prevent scratching her delicate newborn. But with the new year came the most interesting clue yet. Fans were left more confused than ever after Kylie’s security covered her entire body with blankets as she departed from a private jet with Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble on Jan. 2. The decision to hide her body raised suspicions in itself, but plenty of fans were also quick to highlight that pregnant women are advised against flying after 36 weeks, and therefore, if Kylie was in fact pregnant in April, her decision to fly at all is extremely questionable. So, with mounting evidence to suggest that she had already given birth, fans were understandably shocked on Saturday to see that Kylie was still pregnant at Stormi’s birthday party. What’s more, anticipation for Kylie’s birth announcement had reached fever pitch just a day prior after she posted a gallery of photographs from her previously unseen baby shower. The brand new pictures show Kylie looking more pregnant than ever, with her growing bump on display in a white gown. Interestingly, based on reports that claim that the intimate baby shower took place at Khloé Kardashian’s house in early December, the new pictures — in which Kylie looks heavily pregnant — were in fact taken over a month ago. It’s also worth noting that the baby shower happened completely under wraps while Kylie had taken a break from social media after the Astroworld tragedy. If you weren’t aware, Travis Scott — with whom Kylie shares both her children — was at the forefront of backlash after 10 people died and hundreds more were injured on the opening night of the Astroworld festival in Houston on Nov. 5. Travis produced and headlined the fatal event, and has been named in hundreds of lawsuits since the tragedy took place. With that in mind, fans of the Kardashian/Jenners will likely be aware that both Kylie and Travis returned to social media during the festive period after laying low for nearly eight weeks. In the time since their seemingly coordinated returns to social media, both Kylie and Travis have shared multiple Instagram posts, prompting fans to speculate that the couple are attempting to distance the announcement of their new baby from the tragic events of Astroworld. With that in mind, it could be proposed that Kylie may have already given birth, but she and Travis are holding off from announcing the arrival while the tragedy is still at the forefront of people’s conversations. And so, regardless of whether or not she has had her baby, Kylie’s recent bump pics suggest that she wants to keep all and any speculation at bay for now. And if her last pregnancy is anything to go by, it’s hard to predict what will happen next."
77,Put on your antler-shaped tinfoil hats. It's time to break down that wild Yellowjackets finale.,"


Scaachi Koul: Should we talk about the most important part first: How did we feel about everyone’s high school reunion looks?Elamin Abdelmahmoud: With all due respect to Shauna’s new dress and Taissa’s catwalk, it was, in fact, Misty’s look that carried the day. I mean, what a way to say, I’ve moved on. I’ve become so much more than whatever it is you think of me. As for the finale delivering: personally, yes I think it did! But I am extremely on board with occult shit. I literally lose sleep over it. The little evil glance Tai gives as she is crowned the winner of the election, the cut to the head of the dog, the way it’s Misty and Van behind Lottie in the flashback scene as she gently sets the heart of the bear down? I am in. Did it work for you? Advertisement     Shannon: The fucking head of the dog!!!! Horrifying and perfectly revealed.I also loved Tai’s little glance. Her turning out to be seemingly evil was a really satisfying way to end the season, I think. We still have no idea why the hell girl’s eating dirt, but now we’re faced with the possibility that maybe Taissa isn’t possessed by something evil, but choosing to do wicked and torturous things. Or at the very least: She might not be the ally Shauna thinks she is.One of the show’s greatest mysteries is whether the girls in the woods are spiraling into a death cult because they’re so severely traumatized, or they’re being haunted by sinister and potentially supernatural forces — or, what I feel is most likely after that finale, some combination of the two. Where do you guys currently land on the question of how much, if any, of the plot is driven by something magical or otherworldly?Scaachi: Tai’s glance! I wonder if the show is setting her up to fully dissociate from how she’s behaving at night. It really didn’t seem, initially, that she knew that she, I dunno, ate that fucking dog. Advertisement     I think it seems clear that the girls are indeed dealing with something supernatural here, even if a lot of it is being guided by Lottie, who turned out to be…a lot.Here’s another question: Where is grown-up Van? AND WHERE IS GROWN-UP LOTTIE???Elamin: Grown-up Lottie is running a cult of some sort with very cool matching outfits and necklaces, because if you really put your mind to it, there’s nothing you can’t achieve! OK, a big part of the fun of this show has been reading fan theories — from the plausible (“Adam is Javi???”) to the unhinged (“Jackie is a time traveler???”). But one theory that I dismissed out of hand in the middle of the season but now seems entirely in play after that finale is: When the girl dies in the woods at the start of the show, it’s not a flashback, but actually a flash-forward. The theory is that actually, Callie, Shauna’s daughter, has been taken in by people who are re-creating “what happened out there,” and maybe to commemorate eating Shauna’s first baby, they’re about to do it again? Anyway: My mind! It’s broken. I have to say I’m usually someone who does not indulge in fan theories in such an excessive way, but this show has drawn me completely into that universe.Scaachi: It’s not Callie!!!!!! I rewatched the first episode after the finale, and it just really doesn’t look like Callie. Plus, Callie is very much alive, giving her parents disapproving looks because they clearly killed a dude or whatever.I do love that this show is turning everyone into tinfoil hat wearers. I, for example, am convinced Tai ate the rest of the dog. You cannot prove me wrong. She ate that fucking dog.The Misty of it all kind of remains a mystery to me (get it?). It’s clear she followed Lottie when they were in the woods, but is she not a disciple now? The girls would have good reason to be cautious with her, but they keep calling her to get out of jams.Shannon: Misty remains my least favorite character, I think. Obviously Cristina Ricci is divine, but I want more. Why is she…the way that she is? I suppose we have any number of seasons left to find out! Advertisement     As someone who’d have rather watched this story in a super-tight, thrilling miniseries — I have been enjoying it, but I’m not nearly as obsessed as a lot of the sleuths online — I hope this all doesn’t get dragged out for too long. There is still so much we don’t know.But I’m glad we learned some pretty major things by this finale, namely: Lottie is the antler queen, yes? And she’s still alive in the present day, and probably killed Travis?!Elamin, I think you’re totally spot-on that there’s another modern-day cult who are trying to re-create whatever happened out there in the woods. Presumably that’s where adult Natalie is getting dragged off to at the end.Elamin: In many ways, I think this is the success of the show: It is so sick and yet so inviting for audiences to have any number of theories on what they just saw. I certainly did not guess that the “lady in the tree” would end up being Tai herself, and that scene disturbed me, but I took great joy in analyzing Tai’s kid’s drawings.I think given how well Yellowjackets showed the deterioration of civility and cooperation between the people who crashed, there’s bound to be some people disappointed in the decision that it went Full Occult on us. Because there is already a lot to mine — what are their relationships like after they are found? Do they separate quickly, or does it happen over time? Did they ever play soccer again? All rich areas of plot exploration, now perhaps overshadowed by the presence of a powerful adult Lottie. Does the occult payoff work for you?Scaachi: Honestly, I was kind of hoping there wasn’t an occult element to the show, or at least not as much as it’s clearly tipping toward in the finale. I thought it was interesting, the way the show was talking about trauma and how it manifests, and I was thinking that was the cause for these girls (and later, women) experiencing such strangeness and spookiness.I wonder where those cult followers are taking poor Juliette Lewis, whom I love very much.What do you guys think about the Travis thread? Are we just accepting that he did indeed kill himself? Or did Lottie (or one of her followers) empty his bank account, and why?Shannon: I suspect our answers to those questions are still far away. I definitely don’t think Travis killed himself — too simple. For one wild moment when Natalie was clearing off her pictures of the crime scene, I thought maybe she did it. But now I guess it’s Lottie? Advertisement     TBH, I’m still not sold on whether or not all this is gonna pay off in the end!! However far away “the end” is.Scaachi: I did really enjoy the show when it dug into the politics of female friendship and how popularity might translate into a Lord of the Flies situation. Who’s behaved worse: Shauna or Jackie? (Other than Shauna almost eating Travis, or whatever.)Alternatively, I feel like this show is giving mushrooms a bad name.Also, wait! Who is the guy Jackie saw in the back room while she was freezing to death??? He’s in the intro to the show, but I always thought it was Coach!Was the fake-journalist-in-the-basement subplot that necessary if she just…dies at the end?Elamin: Excellent death, five syringes-in-cigarettes out of five, to be honest. I agree that her death rendered that whole subplot unnecessary, though maybe there’s room to elaborate on how she got involved in later seasons.The Travis plotline is my biggest annoyance about the finale. Travis’s death is with us for much of the show: Who killed Travis, why did they do it (and in such an ornate fashion!), and why did they empty the bank account? Great questions to keep me entertained and coming back! But then you have the duty to answer them. They answered one: Lottie is behind the bank account (and, presumably, the murder). But why? Why!!!!!!!The why of the thing is not a cute cliffhanger — it's a crucial payoff to what you’ve been building all season, and to me, leaving that unanswered was a misstep.Shannon: I hated the journalist-in-the-basement subplot! How useless for her to just die.It’s almost criminal that we still barely know anything about what happened to Travis.Scaachi: I really thought Jackie was going to somehow still be alive, mostly because of all those journal entries viewers and redditors realized listed stuff that happened after the date of the plane crash. Were those really just small production errors? The show feels pretty well crafted, I’m surprised that slipped in.Elamin: What a profoundly unpleasant death! If I may bring up something more unpleasant: Her death had me wondering who will be the first person they eat. I know they just ate that bear and all, but winter is here, and she’s just frozen solid. You know, like a freezer. You know, where you keep meat you’ll eat in the future. Guys, I’m trying to ask: When the cannibalism comes, will Jackie be the first meal? Advertisement     Shannon: Ooooh. Would make sense. I can’t believe she’s dead already!! I wonder what wilderness witch brought all that snow on. And why??Scaachi: Any thoughts for what we might get in Season 2?Elamin: Judging by Shauna’s baby bump, it has been about four months since the crash, and we’re already at “let’s get high on shrooms and attempt a murder.” They spent 19 months in the wilderness.Shannon: Oh my god, there’s so much time left. We could be in for years of this. It better all be worth it!!! ●

78,"While Kim Kardashian has yet to comment on all the drama that unfolded, she was reportedly left “shocked” by the entire ordeal.","


“I’m just not playing,” he continued. “I’m taking control of my narrative this year. I’m being the father, the best father, the Ye version of a father, and I’m not finna let this happen.”
 


Ye went on, “Won’t nobody give me the address to my daughter’s birthday party right now. That’s gonna imprint in her mind that I wasn’t there for her.”
 


“They’ve been taking the father’s out the homes purposely,” he said, seemingly referring to the Kardashians. “So I’m speaking up. I’m using my voice to say this ain’t gon’ keep happening. This narrative is not finna happen.”He continued: “It's a lot of people that's not in a position where they ain't got no voice when people be playing games like this, baby mamas be playing games, the grandmas will be playing games like this… they ain't finna play like that with me.”
 


“He seemed okay once he started talking to the family and was in great spirits laughing and playing with Chicago,” one insider told the Sun. “It seems he just wanted to be involved in her day and didn’t want to cause trouble.”“There was no scene between him and Kim but they did spend most of the afternoon at other ends of the garden,” the source claimed. “He chatted with Kris and some other family members but there was no deep discussion with Kim yet.”
 


“I just gotta shout out to Travis Scott for sending me the address and the time, and making sure that I was able to spend that birthday memory with my daughter [and] to be there with the rest of the family,” he continued. Advertisement     
 


“Everyone just had a great time and I’m just really happy that I could be there for my children,” he added.
 


“Kim was shocked to learn that he released a video about not being invited to her party — that’s not true and as soon as he asked to come he was given the location,” a source told UsWeekly.“There were always two parties planned for Chicago, which was Kanye’s idea. He was scheduled to celebrate with her at 4pm today,” the insider said.
 


Given that Ye had spent months pleading for Kim back with various public gestures, his choice to buy a new house within such close proximity of his ex raised many eyebrows among fans.
 


“When my mom took me from Atlanta to Chicago, my dad didn’t come to the coldest and most dangerous city in the world to be next to [me],” he went on. “He said, ‘I’m going to stay down in Atlanta ‘cause of my career.’”“[There’s] nothing with my career, with this rap, with this media, with none of that, that’s gonna keep me from my children. And that’s what I want everybody to know,” he added. “Don’t play with me, don’t play with my children. Ain’t no security gonna get in between me and my children and you ain’t gonna gaslight me.”
 


“Earlier this week, Monday, when I went to go pick my kids up from school, the security stopped me at the gate. So at that point, security was in between me and my children and that's what was not going to happen,” he said.“My daughter wanted me to go inside. I was like, I am the richest Black man and North's father, right, and the security was able to stop me from going into the room with my daughter, and that had not been defined,” he added.
 


Referencing their joint Saturday Night Live appearance from October — which saw the pair share a steamy kiss in a sketch and marked the start of their romance — Ye expressed his discomfort at the whole thing.“How you gonna bring me to SNL and kiss the dude you dating right in front of me, and everybody’s like, ‘Aw, that’s cool’?” he questioned.
 


“Mr. West being kept from the children, by security or anyone else, is news to us,” Wasser said. “Both parties’ priority has always been the children maintaining strong bonds with each of their parents throughout this transition and beyond.”What’s more, sources have since claimed that Pete has “never been” to Kim’s house, despite what Ye may have heard. According to TMZ, who heard from insiders close to the entourage, neither Pete nor Kim were home at the time Ye requested access.
 


Ye raps, “We havin' the best divorce ever / If we go to court, we'll go to court together / Matter of fact, pick up your sis, we'll go to Kourt's together” — with what appears to be a direct reference to Kim’s sister Kourtney, who often goes by the nickname Kourt.
 


“I got love for the nannies, but real family is better / The cameras watch the kids, y'all stop takin' the credit,” he says.
 


“Noncustodial dad, I bought the house next door / What you think the point of really bein' rich for?” he raps.“When you give 'em everything, they only want more / Bougie and unruly, y'all need to do some chores / Rich-ass kids, this ain't yo' mama house / Climb on your brother's shoulders, get that Top Ramen out,” he adds. Advertisement     
 


“And my new bitch bad / I know Illuminati mad,” Ye raps.
 


“I’m really surrendering,” she said. “For someone like me who’s such a control freak and always so used to taking care of myself, to just let go and be taken care of is foreign at this point in life.” “[With] Ye... [it’s] the most instant natural organic attraction and connection,” she added. “I just feel really safe with him.”

79,Take a look back at the early years of Martin Luther King Jr. through these photos ,"


This year, Martin Luther King Jr. would have been 93.King began his career as a Baptist minister in the segregated American South. He rose to national prominence after leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955, which was organized with other activists who went on to found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1957. His civil rights activism was shaped by his Christian beliefs — he earned his doctorate in systemic theology — and the teachings of Indian activist Mahatma Gandhi, who advocated for nonviolence and civil disobedience. When King was assassinated in 1968, Americans mourned him deeply. The annual holiday commemorating his birthday began in 1986.We're looking back at early photos of King’s life with his family, his congregation, and other leaders in the civil rights movement.

80,"Several homeowners are accusing husband-and-wife home renovation duo Candis and Andy Meredith of promising renovations that ended poorly. The Merediths deny the claims and after an internal investigation, Magnolia Network says they “do not believe there was ill or malicious intent.”","


Teisha Hawley couldn’t believe her luck.The mother of three from South Jordan, Utah, had just won what she felt was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. She and her husband, Jeff, had been selected to have several rooms in their home renovated in October 2019 by an Instagram-famous couple, Candis and Andy Meredith, for a new television show. The Merediths, a couple from Utah with a blended family of seven children, had made a name for themselves in the DIY space with a 2015 HGTV show called Old Home Love, a 2017 book of the same name, and their project to convert a 20,000-square-foot 1907 schoolhouse into their family home.Candis told Hawley that the show, eventually called Home Work, would air on Magnolia Network, the soon-to-be-launched television network from Fixer Upper DIY superstars Chip and Joanna Gaines. According to Hawley, Candis told her that Joanna had personally looked at photos and said she liked the Hawleys’ house, which made Hawley feel like she was living “literally every person's dream.” Advertisement  For the Hawleys, the invocation of the Gaines name was everything. After Fixer Upper premiered on HGTV in 2013 and became the No. 1 unscripted series on all of cable television, the Gaineses have become the king and queen of home decor and renovation, with a line at Target and a series of stores and tourist attractions in their hometown of Waco, Texas. Earlier this month they officially launched their Magnolia Network as a joint venture with Discovery, with the aim of reclaiming “the best of what television can be.” Ahead of the launch, the network had premiered several shows from the network on Discovery Plus, including Home Work, which debuted with 13 episodes in July.
 


But to the Hawleys and three other homeowners who were selected in 2019 to be featured on Home Work, the network's launch was a different kind of milestone in what has become a multiyear fight.According to the Hawleys, their dream of a Magnolia-approved home renovation soon turned into a nightmare that left their kitchen, laundry room, and living room unusable, and the family down $35,000. Another homeowner, Aubry Bennion, has accused the Merediths of taking the $13,000 she paid them for a kitchen renovation and then leaving her project incomplete for months. When the renovation was completed, she claims the Merediths did a subpar job. Another pair of homeowners, Vienna and Rob Goates, said they paid the Merediths $50,000 for an addition to their home, but said the couple never completed any work. After this happened, the Goateses negotiated with the Merediths for a return of the money they paid, but have only been compensated for about a third of the deposit to date.On Wednesday, the Merediths posted a series of rebuttals to the claims of the three homeowners on their joint Instagram account. The Merediths denied many of the allegations against them, calling the “one-sided narrative” a series of “half truths and outright lies.” They said that while they understand home renovations can be difficult, they claim they did everything in their power to make their clients happy.“We have not heard from these clients in almost two years, and to have this come out publicly on the eve of the Magnolia network launch feels calculated and timed to hurt us the most. We have always been available for a resolution,” they said in part, adding, “We acknowledge that there were misunderstandings and hard conversations along the way, but just like with our many other happy clients, we did everything we could to resolve any issues that arose.”In a phone call with BuzzFeed News, Candis said the couple are “very proud of the work that we’ve done.”“We've never stolen anything and we’re not out to take anybody else’s livelihood away the same way ours has kind of been taken here,” she said. “And we’re very proud of the show.”Multiple requests for comment to the Gaineses went unanswered.The homeowners, some of whom connected via mutual acquaintances in Utah and began sharing notes, said they had fought to get the Merediths, Discovery, and Magnolia to answer their allegations, but had gotten nowhere. Finally, Bennion decided to go public in a social media Hail Mary. She posted her account of the renovation on her Instagram page on Jan. 5, and the other women soon followed as an act of solidarity.Bennion’s account went viral, and Discovery and Magnolia Network quickly announced that they would be pulling Home Work from the streamer.“Magnolia Network is aware that certain homeowners have expressed concerns about renovation projects undertaken by Candis and Andy Meredith,” Allison Page, the president of Magnolia Network, told BuzzFeed News in a statement. “Within the last several days, we have learned additional information about the scope of these issues, and we have decided to remove Home Work from the Magnolia Network line up pending a review of the claims that have been made.”However, late Thursday night, Magnolia Network announced that Home Work will be returning to the network. “After speaking with homeowners as well as Candis and Andy Meredith regarding renovation projects for Home Work, and hearing a mix of both positive and negative experiences, we do not believe there was ill or malicious intent,” Page told BuzzFeed News in a statement. “Our commitment now is to provide appropriate resolutions for those whose experience with Home Work fell short of our network’s standards.” An attorney for the Hawleys and Bennion told BuzzFeed News they are ""encouraged,"" by Discovery's apparent desire ""to do the right thing and correct the situation,"" while the Goatses told BuzzFeed News they ""are relieved to see that Magnolia has stepped in and committed to take action.""At the time of publication, a spokesperson for Discovery did not respond to further inquiries about the allegations made by the three homeowners. Discovery also did not respond to questions from BuzzFeed News about which production company was behind Home Work and who was responsible for its operations. An IMDb page for Home Work lists the Merediths and one other person as executive producers (this individual did not return a request for comment). Candis told BuzzFeed News the show was coproduced by her and her husband’s production company and one other company, but declined to name either. It’s also difficult to verify what the actual Home Work show looked like, as all episodes have been pulled from the streaming platform.For Bennion, the Hawleys, and the Goateses, the online response to their story has been bittersweet. They are pleased to finally be heard, but they want to know why they had to go so public to have anyone involved pay attention. “For Magnolia’s reputation to be on the line and for them to be so seasoned in doing what they do at Discovery, why would they allow these amateurs to do this and never check on them?” Bennion told BuzzFeed News. (Discovery did not respond to a request for comment on this allegation.)The Goateses, who appeared in a trailer for Home Work despite the fact that their project had not even started, said they want some accountability from Discovery and Magnolia.“I don’t think that the Merediths would have gotten as far as they did without the credibility of the Gaineses and Magnolia and their brand,” Vienna Goates told BuzzFeed News.
 


For Bennion, the experience with the Merediths has been doubly disappointing because she had previously had such a good relationship with the Magnolia brand.Bennion works in project management full time but runs a small business, Hello Maypole, which sells felt balls and garlands, on the side. She has sold her products at Magnolia vendor fairs and even wholesale at Magnolia stores, she said. She also had a friendly relationship with the Merediths through her business’s Instagram page.So when she heard from a mutual friend that the Merediths were partnering with Magnolia, and then saw the couple put a casting call for a yet-to-be-announced show on their Instagram, where they have more than 100,000 followers, she was intrigued. After making and submitting a video for consideration, Bennion got the news she had been selected to have her kitchen renovated.The Hawleys and the Goateses told BuzzFeed News they responded to the same casting call on social media. Hawley had followed the Merediths on Instagram for a while, and was thrilled to be chosen for the show. They said with Candis’s claim that Joanna Gaines had personally expressed interest in their home, they felt especially “solid” about signing up. (In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Candis denied ever telling the Hawleys that the Gaineses saw their house and said the Gaineses had nothing to do with the selection process.) Advertisement  “Hearing Magnolia and then Chip and Jo's name being dropped as much as it was, I felt like that really built a trust in everything,” Jeff Hawley told BuzzFeed News.“I remember just thinking like, wow, this is a big deal,” Vienna Goates said. “It was hard for us to comprehend it at that point. But we just knew it was going to be great.”
 


The Hawleys agreed to renovate their kitchen, dining room, family room, and laundry room — essentially an entire floor — for the show. The Merediths told them the renovation would cost $45,000, which seemed low to the Hawleys, but they said they figured the Merediths knew best.(Homeowners on television renovation shows pay for their own renovations most of the time, according to HGTV. The network states that the draw of being on their shows is primarily getting to work with their designers, not getting things for free.)The couple filmed introductions at their home with a film crew and the Merediths, and the demolition started on Oct. 30, 2019. Hawley was a little concerned that the demolition had started before they had sent any money or signed a contract, but she said Candis told her things moved fast in television and they would figure it all out.Besides, she thought, this was Magnolia.“Magnolia’s here, they’re demoing without [us paying] any money,” Hawley said she thought. “Of course this is legit, you know?”After contractors demolished their first floor, the Hawleys and their three children moved into the basement without a kitchen or laundry. They said that the Merediths told them it would take no longer than three or four weeks, so they figured they could make it work for a short period of time. In November they received a contract from the Merediths and a request for $35,000, the balance owed for the renovation (the remaining $10,000 would cover furniture costs).According to the Hawleys, the Merediths told them they needed to wire the money as soon as possible. This was stressful because the couple had planned to pay for the renovation with a home equity loan, but now didn’t have time to arrange it.“So this wasn’t something we were able to finance,” Teisha Hawley said, adding that they drew the balance directly from their savings account.The Hawleys said after that, things stalled. At first, they chalked it up to the holidays. Then, more time passed.“We would repeatedly be told contractors would be there a certain day to only then be told there were delays or someone had quit and that we needed to be patient,” Teisha Hawley wrote on Instagram. “Sadly our 3-4 week project was well into the 8-10 week range, we would have weeks go by without anyone coming or hearing a thing.” In the meantime, the family spent the holidays in their basement.“Living in the basement in Utah, when the weather is crappy and it’s snowy and dark, it takes a toll on you,” Hawley said.Across town, Bennion’s project for Home Work, which began the same month as the Hawleys, was also not proceeding as she had hoped. She had filmed the initial introduction with the Merediths for the show and said she had agreed to a $25,000 kitchen renovation that the Merediths said would take three weeks. Bennion wrote on Instagram that faced with the same timing issues and inability to get a home equity loan as the Hawleys, she had to borrow the funds from her parents.After demolition started on her kitchen, Bennion said the work also faced delays. She said she tried to put her faith in her prior relationship with the Merediths and the belief that things progressed differently on television, but she began to grow concerned as the project got more delayed. The morning of Thanksgiving 2019, the Merediths requested Bennion wire the funds. She sent them half, $13,000, the following Monday morning.
 


In mid-November, with no movement on the project, Bennion began pressing Candis for answers. After Candis showed her a vision board for the design for her home, she said she began to relax.“Seeing the design elements and the promise of a kitchen by Christmas was enough to keep the worries at bay and the momentum chugging, despite what was actually happening — or not — in my home,” she wrote on Instagram.However, Bennion said on Instagram, things continued to stall. As January turned into February, Bennion said she began to have “absolutely zero faith that any of it was real.”“I was certain I was being fed a line, the same line I had been for the three and a half months before with missing crews and poor work performed one or two days at a time, totaling less than two weeks of actual work days in my home,” she wrote. Advertisement  The Hawleys had also reached a crisis point. In early January, they met with the Merediths to discuss their project. According to the Hawleys, the Merediths told them they had already spent their entire budget and would now require another $35,000 to $40,000 to complete the work. The Merediths requested another $10,000 immediately via wire transfer in order to continue working on the project. The Hawleys were stunned.“Hopeless is the word that comes to mind when I think of that day,” Teisha Hawley wrote on Instagram. “I had applied for this show and had put our family in this situation.”The couple decided they were done. In February, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns, they told the Merediths they wanted to walk away. They said they had never signed their contract or any release allowing Magnolia Network to use their footage. They hired a contractor friend to get the rooms back into a “livable condition,” and have been slowly working on the project since. Two years later, the Hawleys said the experience with the Merediths has taken a toll.“The lack of communication, the lack of respect for our budget and the lack of respect for realizing my family was living in a basement truly makes me sick,” Teisha Hawley wrote on Instagram. Advertisement  
 


In response to the Hawleys’ claims, the Merediths said that the budget increases were due to requests from the Hawleys, saying the “scope changed mutually.” “There was a list of ‘must haves’ that kept growing, and it was clear we needed to sit down to discuss anything they were hoping to increase,” the Merediths wrote. They denied having any knowledge the Hawleys were unhappy until they received a demand letter from the couple’s attorney, but Candis declined to elaborate to BuzzFeed News what it said.“We tried to reach out and offer any and all assistance, we were ignored. We had spent about $10,000 of our own money at this point. We offered solutions. We haven’t heard from them whatsoever in almost two years,” they wrote. The Hawleys, in a statement, told BuzzFeed News they had no ulterior motive for coming forward. “This isn’t just about project delays and a poor renovation experience. There are patterns of manipulation, dishonesty, and gross negligence here,” they said. Advertisement  The Goates family also filmed an introduction for the show in October 2019, during which Candis told them their addition, which would add a much-needed second bathroom for their family of seven, would be featured in the grand finale episode of Home Work. The Goateses were thrilled by Candis’s appreciation for their beloved cottage.“She said, ‘This is the biggest project’ and … ‘I’ve always wanted to do a house like yours,’” Vienna Goates told BuzzFeed News. The couple felt that their project was important to the Merediths and the network, and, when Candis told them a few months later that Joanna Gaines had personally expressed interest in their project, they even felt like the Gaineses were invested. (In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Candis denied ever saying this.)These sentiments helped them look past a series of what they now call red flags with the project. Their renovation, the Goateses said, was beset with delays from the start. They had originally been told the project could possibly be wrapped by Christmas 2019, which came and went. It wasn’t until Jan. 29, 2020, Vienna Goates wrote on Instagram, that Candis finally told them “she’d met with all her contractors and was confident the project could go forward as planned.” The Goateses signed a contract and in February 2020 sent the Merediths a wire transfer for $50,000, half of the project’s total cost, as a deposit. They drew the funds from a home equity loan they had previously arranged.
 


According to the Goateses, still nothing happened. The couple said they frequently reached out for updates, but said Candis told them that COVID-19 was causing project delays. Finally, they heard a concrete update from Candis when, on April 29, 2020, she shared a trailer for Home Work with them. The Goateses said they were stunned to see themselves featured, as they had assumed they wouldn’t be making the cut because of the project delays.“We felt this was an effort to placate our anxiety,” Rob Goates told BuzzFeed News. “Because at this point, I was like, have we been robbed? Is this some sort of con?” But seeing themselves in the preview made them feel more confident that their renovation would start soon.“That solidified at that point Chip and Joanna know what we're going through, and they’re excited about us because there we are on their channel,” Vienna Goates said.The couple’s relief was short-lived. In May, Rob Goates was laid off from his job, and no work had begun. The couple began to question if they should pull out of the project for financial reasons, but they said Candis convinced them to stay the course.“[Candis] was very kind and she said she’d spoken to production and they agreed they would make our HELOC [home equity line of credit] payments for us and help us financially so we could go forward with the project,” Vienna Goates wrote on Instagram. “Candis said that Joanna Gaines specifically had interest in our project, and that they all really wanted our renovation to continue to be on the show.”But by September 2020, with the renovation still not underway and money tight, the Goateses decided to quit.“You may think it was naive and foolish of us to let things go on even this long,” Vienna Goates wrote on Instagram. “You would be right. But a global pandemic makes a convenient excuse for many things, and honestly we were in absolute survival mode. Plus, we had faith in the reputation of Chip and Joanna and their beloved Magnolia brand and Candis’s repeated assurances that everything would work out.”Since then, the Goateses said, they have been fighting to get back the deposit they sent the Merediths. They hired a lawyer and Candis agreed to a judgment that stated the couple could sue if she did not refund the money. According to the Goateses, so far they have been refunded about $14,000 by the Merediths. Rob Goates estimates they have spent upward of $60,000 total on the debacle, including lawyer’s fees. They aren’t sure they will ever get their full deposit back.“There’s nothing quite like paying a bill on a huge balance that is literally for NOTHING,” Vienna Goates wrote on Instagram, referring to their home equity loan.In their rebuttal, the Merediths claimed that after the Goateses asked for their deposit back, the unnamed contractor, whom they had paid the $50,000 to, told them he could not refund the money. So, they said, they agreed to refund the Goates family personally, confirming they had thus far paid them $14,000. “We care deeply about the Goates and we are taking this responsibility seriously,” they wrote.In response to the Merediths' public posting, the Goateses told BuzzFeed News, “We appreciate that they recognized the validity of our situation … however, there has been a lack of regular communication and transparency.“We tried every avenue possible to resolve this privately, our story and our paper trail speaks to that, and speaking out publicly was an extremely unfortunate last resort,” they said.Through word of mouth and mutual acquaintances, the Hawleys eventually connected with Bennion and began to share notes. Bennion’s renovation had also ended poorly, she told BuzzFeed News. In February, she had met with Candis, telling her she planned to quit the show and the project if it didn’t improve.During the meeting, Bennion wrote on Instagram, Candis told her that her project was now also costing way more than expected: $40,000. According to Bennion, Candis also said she had already spent the money. In their rebuttal, the Merediths claim they paid $32,000 of their own funds toward completing the project.“We’ve been using our own money and we can’t really afford to feed our kids,” Bennion said Candis told her. In response, Candis told BuzzFeed News that the remark was “taken out of context,” but fronting the costs of Bennion’s renovation did “put us into tricky situations with our family.”Although she was furious, Bennion believed she had leverage. “From my perspective, she needed my project to be complete more than I needed her to complete it for me,” Bennion wrote on Instagram, adding she believed this because she knew that couples had dropped out of the show. “As such, she was willing to push the financial conversation down the road a bit more, even after I told her she was working at risk.”The Merediths’ contractors eventually finished the kitchen and Bennion filmed a reveal for the show, but she said she never signed a contract or an appearance release for Magnolia. According to Bennion, the finished product has been rife with problems and shoddy work.“I’ll never show the finished product on the internet because it cleans up nice and, with the right filter, is worthy of every wow and word of praise for everyone who doesn’t have to live in it or had to live through what it took to get there,” she wrote on Instagram.The Merediths fiercely denied Bennion’s allegations on Instagram, saying, “[Bennion’s Instagram handle] has made false claims and is purposely trying to take anything she can from us.” They claimed the renovation of her kitchen was done well and posted several videos that they claimed showed Bennion happy with the end result.“We are very proud of the work that went into this project,” they wrote. “We revealed this space on February 20, 2020 and fully acknowledge that before this point in time there were hard conversations and misunderstandings about this project and budget, but we were absolutely under the impression that we had resolved those issues together. If Aubry was unhappy at this point overall, we had no idea whatsoever.”Candis told BuzzFeed News that the majority of Bennion’s complaints about the project’s delays were out of her control as the delays were because of the contractors and workers. She said she and Andy decided not to attempt to recoup the $32,000 they spent of their own money on Bennion’s project because they “didn't want that kitchen to feel anything but positive for her overall.”“I just wanted her to feel at peace. And if that meant that I had spent that money, that was OK,” she said. Bennion told BuzzFeed News that while she did feign excitement during parts of the project, “It is easy to be selective in memory. The truth is that there are many text messages, which I still have record of, that show I was very dissatisfied regularly throughout the project.”
 


Since the homeowners began to share notes in spring 2020, they said they have been working to figure out some sort of restitution. Both the Hawleys and Bennion said they consulted attorneys, who told them even if they had a judgment against the Merediths, it’s unlikely they would ever see a dime. In addition to consulting attorneys, they also in 2021 filed complaints against the couple with the Utah Department of Commerce’s Consumer Protection Division.“We did everything in our power to contact everybody we could to make sure that this was taken care of and nothing was ever addressed or taken care of or anything,” Teisha Hawley said.
 


For a long time, the Goateses said they told themselves that Magnolia, Discovery, and the Gaineses couldn’t possibly know what had happened. If they knew, they thought, they would do something to fix it. In August 2021, they decided to attempt to contact the network and Magnolia, emailing a customer service line. They got a response from an attorney for Discovery, who told them in an email, reviewed by BuzzFeed News, that the network would encourage the couple to address their concerns directly with the Merediths.“We do not believe it would be helpful for Discovery to try and mediate this matter, especially since counsel is already involved and you have already sought legal recourse,” the attorney wrote in part. The attorney added that the network understood that the Merediths would “like to resolve the outstanding balance that is owed.”“At that point, we just hung our heads and cried because we were like, what more can we do?” Rob Goates told BuzzFeed News.All the homeowners said they have been validated by the response on social media to their stories, although going so public has taken a toll. Since Bennion and the others’ accounts went viral, a Utah real estate agent, Aaron Oldham, posted an hourlong IGTV video describing what he said was his own poor experience working with the Merediths on a renovation in 2013. Commenters on Oldham’s video also began to do their own sleuthing on the couple, highlighting a 2020 lawsuit against them for appearing as celebrity endorsers for the real estate seminar company Zurixx.While Bennion said she has appreciated the support, she was disappointed about how difficult it was to get Magnolia Network to respond to her claims. Since she had never interacted with anyone from the network directly, she said, she initially had no contact to seek restitution from.Finally, through her contacts on the purchasing side of the Magnolia company, she said she was connected with Magnolia’s attorney and asked them if she could break an NDA she signed as part of her wholesale agreement to share her story. Bennion shared her experience with the Magnolia team, who, she said, blamed the issue on the show’s production company. The Hawleys said they also contacted Magnolia through their attorney, but said they were told the network said it was not its responsibility.Bennion said she has found the experience hard to reconcile with the version of the Magnolia brand she had loved.“Magnolia shouldn’t be surprised because we gave them a fair shake to do their part,” she said.But when the show rolled around, they began to question how much they had been “taken advantage of.”“As the show launched and we saw how happy and successful and fun it was and we were just left out in the cold, that was really violating,” Rob Goates said.Hawley said she just wants someone to be accountable for what happened to her.“What I have posted, it’s not to trash Magnolia,” Hawley told BuzzFeed News. “I just want them to be better. Their name, people across the entire country trust it. And so the fact that this has happened under their brand is just devastating to me.” ●

81,America may not have to wait until 2024 to witness the next attempt to undo a free and fair election.,"


WASHINGTON — America may not have to wait until 2024 to witness the next attempt to undo a free and fair election.Any candidate for the 435 House seats or 34 Senate seats open in 2022 could follow Donald Trump’s playbook for challenging a lost election, which Republicans have spent the last 14 months building out. And they would have a major advantage over the former president: Overthrowing congressional election results is actually very simple. There’s no need to deal with the Electoral College or state officials across the country. You just need to convince a majority of politicians in either chamber.The House and Senate have absolute authority over their membership. And the House speaker can simply decide not to seat a candidate whose election has been called into question, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi herself considered just last year. Advertisement  All that is required to ignore or overturn a congressional election is a move away from a century of political norms at a time many politicians are actively undermining them.Republicans in and out of Congress continue to prop up the lie that the last election was stolen from Trump and continue to make challenging certified election results routine. After 147 Republicans in Congress voted not to certify the 2020 election results, legislators in four states have launched so-called election “audits” of their own. Election deniers are running to be the top elections officials in at least 12 states in 2022. And Trump’s most vociferous supporters in the party are pushing legislation in statehouses this year to make it easier to force partisan audits in future elections up and down the ballot.While those efforts could certainly help Republicans in the next presidential election, they could take advantage this year of the new normal they’ve created. Poll after poll shows that roughly two-thirds of Republican voters still believe that President Joe Biden’s election was illegitimate and a December Washington Post survey shows that 57% of them are not confident that the 2022 vote will be counted accurately. The question isn’t whether another Republican will cry voter fraud and try to overturn a fair congressional election, it’s when — and whether party leaders will step in to help them.Over the past century, it has been extremely rare for Congress to overturn state-certified elections. Modern Congresses have tended to defer to the states and the courts to sort out contested elections, Princeton University professor of politics Keith Whittington said. But in the 19th century, it was much more common for the Senate and House to settle disputes themselves, with a majority vote being the ultimate arbiter. Advertisement  With state election boards under siege for the past year by Trump and his supporters, the standard of Congress leaving it to the states could soon be over.“You can imagine either chamber wanting to go back to its roots,” Whittington said.Trump remains the X factor hanging over the midterms. He is encouraging Republicans to keep false voter fraud claims alive in 2022, and a good number of the party’s voters expect their candidates to push back on election results. In the Washington Post survey, nearly a third of Republicans said they were not confident that officials in their states would accept the results of the 2022 election — and that’s in states controlled mostly by Republicans. Asked about states controlled by mostly Democrats, that number shot up to 56%.It’s easiest to see how this could play out in the House, where hundreds of races present more radical members with more opportunity. Say a handful of Republicans lose House races in November and claim that there was widespread voter fraud in their districts. Republicans are considered the favorites to win the majority back in 2022, meaning the next speaker — perhaps current Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy — could come under intense pressure to “stop the steal” in races across the country. He — and the rest of the Republicans in Congress — would likely be flooded with calls demanding “full forensic audits.” Advertisement  For this scenario to play out, Republicans have to win back a majority in the House of Representatives. That would allow them to elect one of their own because the speaker of the House has the power to seat — or not seat — any member in a contested race. Democrats could challenge that decision, but Republicans would only need a majority vote to uphold it.Usually there are more steps in the process. Under the Federal Contested Election Act of 1969, a losing candidate can appeal to the Committee on House Administration to start an investigation, for which there are no real ground rules, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The committee can send a delegation to the disputed district to recount the ballots themselves. They could conduct their own quasi-audit and impound voting machines and examine voter registration records. They could hold a trial, with both candidates presenting evidence for why they should be seated. And they can make up whatever rules they’d like about which ballots to count and which not to count, regardless of state law. The courts, historically, have stayed out of this; the Constitution guarantees that each chamber of Congress “shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members.”The House doesn’t even need a candidate to complain to kick off this process — any member or member-elect can object to the seating of another member. It’s even possible, though very unusual, for the House to investigate a congressional election because of a complaint by a single voter.“The Constitution is even thinner on this than it is on what impeachment would look like,” Whittington said. Advertisement  Ultimately, a majority vote on the House floor will settle who gets seated. The Senate also has total control over who gets seated and how to resolve disputes. Though contested statewide elections are less frequent, and the Senate has far fewer races to begin with, the majority would have the ultimate power to settle a disputed race.Neither party is talking about pursuing electoral challenges right now, but both suspect the other may do so. “I don’t trust Republicans to play fair, period,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said.“This is a disturbing potential implication of the electoral paranoia and lunacy that has been unleashed on the land by Donald Trump,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who sits on both the House Administration Committee and the committee investigating Jan. 6. “Anyone can try to create a conspiracy and spread it like wildfire on the internet without any facts at all. And then politicians in the GOP get cornered and feel as if they have to commit to a certain conspiracy theory or they’re going to get attacked by Trump and his followers.”McCarthy downplayed this possibility while entering the House chamber Tuesday, saying that there are often close races but his concern is Democrats trying to swing the results. Advertisement  Republicans point to Pelosi as the one who is upending norms by using her majority to kick Republicans off committees. The Democrat-controlled House voted to remove Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar from committee assignments last year for threatening or abusive comments they’d made.McCarthy also referenced the last time the House overturned a race, in 1985, when then-speaker Tip O’Neill and House Democrats handed a contested congressional seat to one of their own. In what has become known as a fight over Indiana’s “Bloody Eighth” district, House Democrats conducted their own recount, following tabulation errors and claims of vote irregularities. Republicans claimed Democrats were stealing the election and staged a walkout. “You always want to make sure you never end up to that Bloody Eighth when the Democrats stole the race,” McCarthy said.Pelosi openly considered using the House’s powers one year ago when a Democrat challenged her loss in an Iowa race that was decided by just six votes. Although the state certified Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks’ win over Democrat Rita Hart, Hart appealed to the House to investigate. Pelosi mulled seating Hart, but dropped it after several Democrats raised concerns and Hart withdrew her challenge.“If I wanted to be unfair, I wouldn’t have seated the Republican from Iowa because that was my right on the opening day. I would have just said, they’re not seated, and that would have been my right as speaker to do,” Pelosi said at the time. Advertisement  Republicans say Pelosi only backed down because she already had a majority secured. But if the 2022 midterms result in a close election where the majority hinges on only a seat or two? There could be chaos. Members from one party could object to the seating of members in another to block a majority, leading to retaliatory challenges in the other direction. It could take weeks to sort out who ultimately controls the chamber. As with much of the American political system, the rules offer no clear guideline for resolution if norms are abandoned.Republican Rep. Randy Weber said he believes state results should be upheld, but one side trying a power grab would be met with retaliation. If that happens with the majority in the balance, he said, “Get your seat early. Bring your popcorn.” ●

82,"""In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable to return to his home.""","


Prince Harry is challenging a government decision that doesn’t allow him to personally pay for police protection when he and his family visit the UK.A legal representative for Harry, the Duke of Sussex, released a statement Saturday about his choice to seek a judicial review, in which a court will examine whether the decision to bar him from paying for police protection out of pocket was made lawfully and fairly. Advertisement     ""In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable to return to his home,” the representative said.When the duke and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, announced that they would step back as working members of the royal family in January 2020, they lost the UK taxpayer-funded security granted to senior royals. At the time, according to the representative, Harry offered to pay for continued police protection, but that request was not approved by the UK Home Office.“Prince Harry inherited a security risk at birth, for life. He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats,” the representative said in a statement. “While his role within the Institution has changed, his profile as a member of the Royal Family has not. Nor has the threat to him and his family.”
 


After a stint in Canada, Harry, Meghan, and their son, Archie, moved to the US following their departure from the royal family, where they eventually hired their own security team. According to their representative, that private team can't legally provide the level of protection they need in the UK, and it's already caused a problem.On a trip back to the UK in July 2021, Harry’s security was allegedly compromised as he left a charity event because he didn't have police protection, which was what prompted him to take legal action. The duke is still “willing to cover the cost of security, as not to impose on the British taxpayer,” the representative said.The threat is particularly high against the Sussexes in the UK from extremist groups as well as others fixated on the controversy around their leaving, their spokesperson said.“As is widely known, others who have left public office and have an inherent threat risk receive police protection at no cost to them. The goal for Prince Harry has been simple — to ensure the safety of himself and his family while in the UK so his children can know his home country,"" the legal representative's statement said.“After another attempt at negotiations was also rejected, he sought a judicial review in September 2021 to challenge the decision-making behind the security procedures, in the hopes that this could be re-evaluated for the obvious and necessary protection required.”Meghan and Archie have not returned to the UK since the split; nor has the couple's new daughter, Lilibet, who was born June 4, 2021, in California.“The UK will always be Prince Harry’s home and a country he wants his wife and children to be safe in. With the lack of police protection, comes too great a personal risk. Prince Harry hopes that his petition — after close to two years of pleas for security in the UK — will resolve this situation,” the representative also said. Advertisement     In the couple's explosive interview with Oprah in March 2021, Meghan described the stress they felt after learning they'd be losing their security team.""I even wrote letters to his family saying, ‘Please, it's very clear the protection of me or Archie is not a priority. I accept that. That is fine. Please keep my husband safe. I see the death threats. I see the racist propaganda. Please keep him safe. Please don't pull his security and announce to the world when he and we are most vulnerable,’” Meghan said at the time. “And they said it's just not possible.”

83,Djokovic had been poised to compete for what could have been a record-breaking 21st Grand Slam title at the Open.,"


Novak Djokovic, the top-ranked men’s tennis player in the world, left Australia on Sunday and lost his chance to compete in the Australian Open after a battle with the country’s immigration officials over whether he should be exempt from COVID-19 vaccination requirements.The tournament begins Monday, and Djokovic had traveled to the country under a visa that granted him a medical exemption from being vaccinated because he had recently recovered from COVID. But after public outcry from Australians, who have faced stringent border restrictions and lockdowns during the pandemic, his visa was canceled Jan. 6. Advertisement     After back-and-forth within Australia’s judicial system, Djokovic on Sunday lost his final chance to legally remain in the country when a federal court upheld Immigration Minister Alex Hawke’s decision to cancel Djokovic’s visa “in the public interest.” Hawke tweeted Sunday that Djokovic had left Australia, and photographs showed him at Melbourne Airport, where he reportedly boarded a flight to Dubai.“Australia’s strong border protection policies have kept us safe during the pandemic, resulting in one of the lowest death rates, strongest economic recoveries, and highest vaccination rates in the world,” Hawke said in a statement.
 


Hawke added that 91.6% of Australians over age 16 have now been fully vaccinated, and only because of the country’s vaccination program have some international travel restrictions been lifted. Australia banned international travel for much of the pandemic, and it has begun allowing travel only since November for people who are fully vaccinated or who fit into a series of specific exemptions.“Australians have made great sacrifices to get to this point and the Morrison Government is firmly committed to protecting this position, as the Australian people expect,” Hawke said.In a statement, Djokovic said he was “extremely disappointed” by the decision. Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić told reporters he believed the decision was political and described it as a witch hunt.Djokovic had been poised to compete for what could have been a record-breaking 21st Grand Slam title at the Australian Open.

84,"""This was an act of terror,” President Biden said of the incident.","


A 44-year-old British man has been identified as the suspect who took four people hostage in a Texas synagogue Saturday.Malik Faisal Akram, 44, died in a ""shooting incident"" after an hourslong standoff with police at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas, authorities said. The hostages were rescued unharmed when FBI agents entered the synagogue around 9 p.m. local time Saturday. It wasn't immediately clear whether agents or the suspect himself fired the shot that killed him. Advertisement     On Sunday, the FBI for the first time identified Akram and said they believed he had acted alone.“The FBI’s Evidence Response Team (ERT) will continue processing evidence at the synagogue. At this time, there is no indication that other individuals are involved,” the FBI said in a statement. “The FBI’s North Texas Joint Terrorism Task Force (NTJTTF), which includes member agencies from across the region, will continue to follow investigative leads.”Later on Sunday, the UK's Greater Manchester Police said two teenagers were in custody for questioning in connection with the incident.Investigation is continuing about Akram's motive. On Saturday, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said in a press conference that authorities did not believe there was an ongoing threat after Akram's death.“We obviously are investigating. We will continue to investigate the hostage taker; we will continue to investigate his contacts. Our investigation will have global reach,” DeSarno said.“We do believe from our engagement with this subject that he was singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community, but we will continue to work to find motive.” Advertisement     
 


Multiple news outlets reported Saturday that authorities believe Akram was seeking the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a neuroscientist who was convicted of attempting to kill US soldiers and FBI agents and is currently serving an 86-year sentence at a nearby federal prison. According to US intelligence, she was suspected of being associated with al-Qaeda.When asked about the hostage situation Sunday, President Joe Biden told reporters, “This was an act of terror.”The president said it remains unknown why the Colleyville synagogue was targeted, but he added he had plans on speaking with the rabbi and is also working with Attorney General Merrick Garland to “address these types of acts.”Biden told pool reporters that while he didn’t have all the facts about the incident, he believed the hostage taker obtained a gun by buying it “on the street.” Biden also suggested that Akram had spent a night in a homeless shelter before taking hostages Saturday.“Guns are — the idea of background checks are critical, but you can’t stop someone from buying something on the street,” Biden said.Akram was from the town of Blackburn, north of Manchester in the UK. His family in the UK is in communication with authorities, the Blackburn Muslim Community told BuzzFeed News in a statement via Facebook message. “Please respect their privacy and allow them to grieve privately.”Earlier on Sunday, the page had posted a message apparently from Akram's brother, which condemned his actions and said that Akram had mental health issues.“We would also like to add that any attack on any human being be it a Jew, Christian, or Muslim etc is wrong and should always be condemned,” the now-deleted message said, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “It is absolutely inexcusable for a Muslim to attack a Jew or for any Jew to attack a Muslim, Christian, Hindu, vice versa etc etc.” Advertisement     Police in the UK were also assisting US authorities in the investigation, Assistant Chief Constable Dominic Scally of Counter Terror Policing North West said in a statement. He asked the public to report to police anything that might be linked to terrorism.The leader of the local government council, Mohammed Khan, also said his organization was assisting authorities.""In Blackburn we firmly stand by the belief that no community should live in fear for its safety as they go about practicing their religious beliefs or identify,"" he said in a statement. ""We stand in solidarity in condemning this act of hate, violence and terror.""Back in Texas, Congregation Beth Israel’s rabbi, Charlie Cytron-Walker, thanked law enforcement, first responders, and his religious community in a Facebook post Sunday, saying he’s also “thankful and filled with appreciation for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support.”“All of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us,” Cytron-Walker wrote. “I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the CBI Community, the Jewish Community, the Human Community. I am grateful that we made it out. I am grateful to be alive.”In Saturday’s press conference, DeSarno said the negotiator who was in touch with Akram during the hostage situation had a “high frequency and duration of contact with him” for 10 hours, adding that the relationship between the two “ebbed and flowed a little bit and sometimes got intense.” DeSarno also said there will be independent investigations into how Akram died, which he said was standard operating procedure.Liz Truss, the UK's foreign secretary, tweeted Sunday, “My thoughts are with the Jewish community and all those affected by the appalling act in Texas. We condemn this act of terrorism and anti-semitism. We stand with US in defending the rights and freedoms of our citizens against those who spread hate.”

85,"“The close ties across the country means it isn't hard for things to spread – whether that be gossip, word games, or good public health measures to keep us safe during a pandemic.”","


The success of Wordle, the game most easily characterized by the green-and-yellow square emojis that are saturating Twitter feeds worldwide, traces back to a small group of nerdy New Zealanders who were looking for a pandemic distraction.“The close ties across the country means it isn't hard for things to spread — whether that be gossip, word games, or good public health measures to keep us safe during a pandemic,” said Asher Wilson-Goldman, a public sector communications professional who was one of the first people to start tweeting about the game. Advertisement  New York software engineer Josh Wardle designed Wordle for his partner. Since November, its daily traffic has skyrocketed from 90 users to 2 million.
 


According to data provided by Twitter, since Wardle released the game in November 2021, there have been 1.7 million tweets mentioning ""Wordle"" globally. But a Twitter thread from New Zealand in late November really kicked it off. Advertisement  “Have you been playing Wordle? Like Mastermind (the board game) but for 5-letter words,"" Kiwi web developer David Ritchie tweeted Nov. 24. “I nailed today's in 3 attempts.”
 


Andrew Chen, 29, a research fellow at the University of Auckland who helped the government with its COVID-19 contact-tracing app, saw Ritchie’s tweet. “I like logic and word puzzles generally (stuff like Sudoku and escape rooms), and I really liked Mastermind once upon a time. I was hooked straight away,” he told BuzzFeed News.The premise of Wordle works as such: You have six tries to guess a five-letter word. The game is updated with a new word daily.So Chen started sharing his results under the thread and comparing them with other mutual connections. Which meant that Paul Brislen, a telecommunications executive in his 50s, took note of his Twitter colleagues talking about five-letter words on his feed. A former journalist himself and self-described “word nerd,” Brislen liked the idea of a pared-down, distraction-free game that forced you to “concentrate and use your brain.”
 


Participants followed the golden rule of never tweeting the answer. “That meant there was no feeling of exclusion or being too late to the party,” Brislen said. “I think that was quite important at the start. We were all in it together.”Wilson-Goldman said he encountered the thread still simmering in this small group of Twitter colleagues. “I think when I joined, there were maybe five or six people already playing through the thread, and I already followed about half of them,” he said.
 


More of their Kiwi digital friends began sharing results and number of tries under that same thread every day. It began to get a little chaotic with the flurry of messaging, so Kelsy Fletcher, a New Zealand public servant and longtime connection of Chen’s from school, suggested they use a hashtag instead, and #DailyWordleClub was born.“It felt more like you were indicating that you were part of the club than as a way to collate content,” Chen said.Even the square emojis came directly from the New Zealand crew. Elizabeth S., an adviser to the New Zealand government, found it would be “much easier” to describe their results using colored emoji tiles for an easy, spoiler-free way of sharing. The format caught on among the #DailyWordleClub members — and then Wardle implemented it in the site’s share option.
 


“There was some analysis done a while ago that showed the New Zealand Twitter community is more highly interconnected than in other countries,” Chen said. “I mean, we like to say that there's two degrees of separation in New Zealand.”Google searches for “Wordle” first began spiking in New Zealand around mid-December 2021. This pattern was quickly followed a few days later in Australia after Aussie journalists who follow some of the original New Zealand players saw it and began tweeting. On Dec. 23, Guardian Australia became the first publication to write about it; the outlet embedded six tweets from people playing the game, but only one appeared to belong to someone outside the blue-checked media community.After the Guardian article, searches began spiking in the United Kingdom and Canada. A New York Times reporter based in London profiled the origins of the game on Jan. 3. Since then, Google searches for the term “wordle” have skyrocketed over fifteenfold.
 


The internet has seen similar trends to this before, in which a trend grows from the media’s own personal interest, rather than via organic usage by people who don’t work in media. We saw it happen with “cheugy,” a term resurfaced ironically by TikTok user @webkinzwhore143. The term was pushed into the online zeitgeist after relentless media coverage about it. What began as a casual joke surrounding a teen-fabricated term to highlight millennials’ awkward aesthetic became a widely used word, in part due to media outlets’ immediate gravitation toward it.Often, it’s been journalists building the Wordle trend, as word lovers who play the game, fall in love with it, tweet about it (often from their blue-checked accounts), and then write stories about it, encouraging others to do the same.In just under a month, 228 articles have been published about Wordle. Between Jan. 1 and Jan. 13, 1.2 million tweets containing the green-and-yellow square emojis have been sent.Leading into 2022, the vast majority of tweets around Wordle were coming from New Zealand and Australia — but Twitter shared that the top three countries tweeting about Wordle in recent weeks are the US, the UK, and Canada. Advertisement  But there’s some indication the game is finally moving to other social networks. Last week, several TikTok accounts dedicated to Wordle were created, where users share their results and post memes.
 


And the Kiwi crew who started it all are proud of how they helped the game grow.""I didn't realize we were early adopters; it was just a bunch of people playing a game over summer. But then once the share button was introduced — hats off to Elizabeth for suggesting sharing that way — my Twitter feed is now entirely full of green squares,"" Brislen said. ""I can well understand why some people get angsty about it, as it's gone nuts. But just learn to mute keywords, OK, people?""Here are some tips, techniques, and opening word suggestions from some of Wordle’s earliest adopters:Andrew Chen: “I like to use ‘TIMES’ as a starting word because it has an ‘S’ at the end to quickly tell you if it's a plural word or not. I think there is a general consensus that starting words with lots of vowels are good for narrowing down the number of possible words. There's folks out there who have done analyses of the 2,500 words in the Wordle answer dictionary and determined what the ‘best’ starting words are. But I'd like to think that there are no bad starting words, that everyone can have fun whatever way they like.”Paul Brislen: “My average suggests I need more help than I can give. Usually takes me five guesses to get there, while my wife does them in three. Ugh. Use the ‘FORCE’ (a good five-letter word), try a different starter word each day, remember that what worked yesterday won't tomorrow, and don't forget that double letters are allowed (bloody ‘CLOCK’ ruined my streak).”Asher Wilson-Goldman: “I use ‘SPELT’ as my opening word and love it. It provides a good range of letters while keeping ‘R’ and ‘A’ spare to provide good follow-up word options. I know a lot of people advocate starting with words with three or four vowels, but I think they're wrong — it's much easier to guess vowels than consonants because there are fewer of them.”Thomas Beagle: “I like varying my starting words. One day I'm going to get that elusive first-guess winner! My advice is that you don't have to try to get the answer on every guess; sometimes it's better to ignore the letters you've already got and guess a word with five new letters.”

All of the hostages who were held for hours inside Congregation Beth Israel, a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, were released and are safe, Gov.

He did not need medical attention.The status of the hostage taker was not immediately clear.The hourslong standoff outside the Dallas–Fort Worth area began Saturday morning and drew a massive police presence, including a SWAT team from Colleyville police, FBI negotiators, state public safety officers, and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Jessika Harkay, a reporter for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, tweeted that before the livestream stopped, a man interrupted and could be heard shouting, “What the fuck is wrong with America?” and ""Don't fucking cry on me. I have 6 beautiful kids ... There are hostages in the synagogue who are going to die.”
 


The man reportedly demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a neuroscientist who was convicted of attempting to kill US soldiers and FBI agents and is currently serving an 86-year sentence at a nearby federal prison. According to US intelligence, she was suspected of being associated with al-Qaeda.Despite reports that the man was asking for the release of his “sister,” the Daily Beast reported that a lawyer who previously represented Siddiqui’s biological brother said he is not the person in the synagogue.The FBI office in Dallas did not respond to BuzzFeed News’ requests for comment.
 


Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson tweeted that police officers were monitoring the city’s synagogues. The LAPD tweeted that it would be doing the same for LA’s synagogues.Synagogues have been the site of multiple mass shootings in recent years, including Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh in 2017, Chabad of Poway synagogue near San Diego in 2019, and an attack in Halle, Germany, the same year.

An Asian woman was killed when a man pushed her in front of an oncoming subway train in New York City on Saturday morning.Authorities identified her as Michelle Alyssa Go, a 40-year-old woman from the Upper West Side. Go was standing alone waiting for the train at the Times Square station at West 42nd Street and Broadway around 9:30 a.m. when she was attacked. Advertisement     ""This incident was unprovoked, and the victim does not appear to have any interaction with the subject,"" said NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell.

Police believe he was experiencing homelessness.It is so far unclear if Go was targeted because of her race. Police and the Manhattan district attorney said they were still investigating possible charges and evaluating the evidence.""Too often, Asian Americans are seen as foreigners and people who are not truly American, and we want to make sure we are standing as a city against discrimination,"" Rep.

Older Asian people, many of them immigrants, have been targeted in unprovoked attacks, including stabbings, shootings, and beatings. In March 2020, six Asian women were killed in a series of shootings at spas in the Atlanta area.Wilcox noted that although the victim was Asian, minutes before the violent attack, Martial had approached another woman on the platform, who was not Asian, and made threatening movements toward her. She feared he would push her onto the tracks and moved away before witnessing him push and kill Go.The NYPD has ramped up its patrol of subway platforms and trains after an increase in transit crimes during the pandemic. Two officers were on the subway platform at the time of the attack.

88,The massive blast caused atmospheric shock waves seen by orbiting weather satellites.,"


A violent volcanic eruption on a South Pacific island triggered a tsunami advisory and flooding in Hawaii and parts of the West Coast on Saturday morning.Satellite footage showed a massive plume of ash and smoke and atmospheric shock waves following the eruption of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai underwater volcano near Tonga on the evening of Jan. 14.The boom was reportedly heard as far away as New Zealand (more than 1,200 miles away) and Anchorage, Alaska (more than 5,800 miles away). The ash plume reached up to 12 miles into the air, Tonga Geological Services reported, and dozens of coastal areas, from Japan to Chile, triggered tsunami warnings. Advertisement     
 


Video footage from Tonga residents showed a swift, violent ocean tide rushing inland. One person told a New Zealand outlet that she felt the ground shake, saw water flood her home, and watched as the walls of a neighbor’s home collapsed. Resident Faka’iloatonga Taumoefolau tweeted, “Raining ash and tiny pebbles, darkness blanketing the sky.”
 


Nukuʻalofa, the capital of Tonga, is less than 50 miles south of the eruption, and many parts of the South Pacific island are reportedly experiencing a near-total power outage.The US Tsunami Warning System issued a tsunami advisory for the West Coast states, Alaska, and Hawaii, meaning a ""potential for strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water."" Waves 1 to 3 feet high were expected along the Oregon and Washington coasts.Maui and Kaua’i saw waves of 2.7 feet high, just under the criterion for a tsunami warning (3 feet). Hawaii's tsunami advisory was canceled just before 8 a.m. local time. National Weather Service reports advised people to stay away from beaches, harbors, and marinas, but said that widespread inundation was not expected.Japan's system issued warnings for Iwate prefecture to the north of its main Honshu island and for the Amami and Tokara islands to the south. Most of its east coast was placed under a tsunami advisory.Video in Santa Cruz, California, showed minor flooding along the coast. Cal Fire shared video of large waves hitting El Granada, California, on Saturday morning.
 


Most tsunamis are caused by large earthquakes, but they can also be triggered by landslides or volcanic eruptions. Although the eruption in Tonga was one of the most violent seen by orbiting weather satellites, the amount of water displaced would still be much less than can be caused by a major earthquake. Still, even relatively small surges in sea level can cause damage when water surges into bays and inlets.

90,"A viral TikTok had some people trying throat swabs for their at-home rapid COVID tests, but experts are warning against it.","


People are posting on social media that they’re getting positive COVID results after swabbing their throat for an at-home rapid test rather than doing the recommended nasal swab.In a TikTok with more than a million views, a reporter demonstrated that when she swabbed her nose for an at-home rapid COVID-19 antigen test, the result was negative.But when Alison Hall swabbed her throat minutes later and did the same kind of test, it came back positive. She also later confirmed a positive result with a PCR test.“Moral of the story — consider swabbing your throat in addition to your nose for early detection and get a backup PCR test to confirm,” she says in the video.#SwabYourThroat also trended on Twitter, as multiple people posted about testing positive to COVID with a throat swab after negative nasal swabs. Manufacturers recommend nasal swabs, however, and all the data on how well the tests work are based on using it as instructed. As Omicron sends the world to record levels of COVID infections, and long testing lines make it harder to get PCR tests, people are often relying on at-home rapid tests to see if they’re infected. A sore throat is a trademark Omicron symptom and many people report it being their first indication of having the virus. Advertisement     But experts don’t endorse throat swabbing — even if some of them are doing it themselves on their own home tests. For one, the FDA does not recommend using tests incorrectly.Nam Tran, an associate clinical professor in the department of pathology and laboratory medicine who oversees COVID-19 testing efforts at UC Davis Health, told BuzzFeed News that he does not recommend swabbing the throat because a lot of things could affect it, such as food in the throat. Even drinking something beforehand could cause the virus to wash down and not appear on the test.He acknowledged that it was possible a throat swab result may come back positive earlier. Rapid tests are more likely to give a false negative early on, which may be why people want to swab their throat.“There’s a biological factor, meaning the virus may replicate more early on in the throat and expand thereafter,” he said. However, it’s not as simple as just using a throat swab to collect it.“There’s a technological factor,” he said. “How good are you at collecting a nasal swab versus an oral swab?”A throat swab is more complicated to perform. “Technique matters because you can have a perfect test and if you just swab loosely or lightly because you have a sensitive nose or sensitive mouth, you might not get enough virus for your test to detect it anyway irrespective of where the virus lives,” Tran said.If someone has symptoms of COVID-19 but gets a negative result on an at-home antigen test, Tran said to go to the doctor or to get a PCR test because it’s important to test over time.“At some point, the viral concentration goes up high enough where the test will pick it up anyway,” he said. “But if you are symptomatic, test negative, out of the abundance of precaution, you should still mask up, you should still try to stay away from people.” Advertisement     Michael Mina, chief science officer of eMed, said during a Zoom webinar Thursday that throat swabbing for COVID-19 is still so new, many people might not know how to do it, but he’s hopeful people will learn.“We know throat swabs can work, but saliva is different,” he said. “Throat swabs might be working because they’re mixing with saliva in terms of where you’re putting your swab in your oropharynx or your cheeks depending on how you’re doing it.”He said antigen tests have always been less sensitive than PCR tests, but it’s not that antigen tests aren’t detecting Omicron, it’s just that people are becoming infectious with this variant before the virus has a chance to grow into the nose. Like Tran, Mina said symptomatic people should assume they have COVID-19.Mina said swabbing the throat can be dangerous, so people should follow the FDA guidance, but he acknowledged the FDA also has to exist within tight guidelines that sometimes have more practical than scientific origins.“I think oftentimes people assume that the way it’s been authorized by the FDA is always optimal, like the spacing with the vaccines,” Mina said. “The three to four weeks was not optimal, that was out of convenience to get the clinical trials done quickly. But then because that’s the data that’s given to the FDA, that’s what the FDA has to authorize because they don’t have other data to suggest otherwise even if the science says a different picture.”He admitted he does swab his throat when he’s using an at-home test, but if others do the same, they should do so at their own risk.Blythe Adamson, a health economist and pharmacoepidemiologist serving as principal quantitative scientist at Flatiron Health, told BuzzFeed News that she thinks as soon as scientists believe throat swabbing is safe and effective, the FDA will most likely move quickly to authorize it.In a statement provided to BuzzFeed News, an FDA spokesperson said COVID-19 tests should be used as authorized.“The FDA has noted safety concerns regarding self-collection of throat swabs, as they are more complicated than nasal swabs – and if used incorrectly, can cause harm to the patient. The CDC recommends that throat swabs be collected by a trained healthcare provider.”On Twitter, the FDA said that they don't have any data that suggests throat swabs are accurate.

91,America may not have to wait until 2024 to witness the next attempt to undo a free and fair election.,"


WASHINGTON — America may not have to wait until 2024 to witness the next attempt to undo a free and fair election.Any candidate for the 435 House seats or 34 Senate seats open in 2022 could follow Donald Trump’s playbook for challenging a lost election, which Republicans have spent the last 14 months building out. And they would have a major advantage over the former president: Overthrowing congressional election results is actually very simple. There’s no need to deal with the Electoral College or state officials across the country. You just need to convince a majority of politicians in either chamber.The House and Senate have absolute authority over their membership. And the House speaker can simply decide not to seat a candidate whose election has been called into question, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi herself considered just last year. Advertisement  All that is required to ignore or overturn a congressional election is a move away from a century of political norms at a time many politicians are actively undermining them.Republicans in and out of Congress continue to prop up the lie that the last election was stolen from Trump and continue to make challenging certified election results routine. After 147 Republicans in Congress voted not to certify the 2020 election results, legislators in four states have launched so-called election “audits” of their own. Election deniers are running to be the top elections officials in at least 12 states in 2022. And Trump’s most vociferous supporters in the party are pushing legislation in statehouses this year to make it easier to force partisan audits in future elections up and down the ballot.While those efforts could certainly help Republicans in the next presidential election, they could take advantage this year of the new normal they’ve created. Poll after poll shows that roughly two-thirds of Republican voters still believe that President Joe Biden’s election was illegitimate and a December Washington Post survey shows that 57% of them are not confident that the 2022 vote will be counted accurately. The question isn’t whether another Republican will cry voter fraud and try to overturn a fair congressional election, it’s when — and whether party leaders will step in to help them.Over the past century, it has been extremely rare for Congress to overturn state-certified elections. Modern Congresses have tended to defer to the states and the courts to sort out contested elections, Princeton University professor of politics Keith Whittington said. But in the 19th century, it was much more common for the Senate and House to settle disputes themselves, with a majority vote being the ultimate arbiter. Advertisement  With state election boards under siege for the past year by Trump and his supporters, the standard of Congress leaving it to the states could soon be over.“You can imagine either chamber wanting to go back to its roots,” Whittington said.Trump remains the X factor hanging over the midterms. He is encouraging Republicans to keep false voter fraud claims alive in 2022, and a good number of the party’s voters expect their candidates to push back on election results. In the Washington Post survey, nearly a third of Republicans said they were not confident that officials in their states would accept the results of the 2022 election — and that’s in states controlled mostly by Republicans. Asked about states controlled by mostly Democrats, that number shot up to 56%.It’s easiest to see how this could play out in the House, where hundreds of races present more radical members with more opportunity. Say a handful of Republicans lose House races in November and claim that there was widespread voter fraud in their districts. Republicans are considered the favorites to win the majority back in 2022, meaning the next speaker — perhaps current Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy — could come under intense pressure to “stop the steal” in races across the country. He — and the rest of the Republicans in Congress — would likely be flooded with calls demanding “full forensic audits.” Advertisement  For this scenario to play out, Republicans have to win back a majority in the House of Representatives. That would allow them to elect one of their own because the speaker of the House has the power to seat — or not seat — any member in a contested race. Democrats could challenge that decision, but Republicans would only need a majority vote to uphold it.Usually there are more steps in the process. Under the Federal Contested Election Act of 1969, a losing candidate can appeal to the Committee on House Administration to start an investigation, for which there are no real ground rules, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The committee can send a delegation to the disputed district to recount the ballots themselves. They could conduct their own quasi-audit and impound voting machines and examine voter registration records. They could hold a trial, with both candidates presenting evidence for why they should be seated. And they can make up whatever rules they’d like about which ballots to count and which not to count, regardless of state law. The courts, historically, have stayed out of this; the Constitution guarantees that each chamber of Congress “shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members.”The House doesn’t even need a candidate to complain to kick off this process — any member or member-elect can object to the seating of another member. It’s even possible, though very unusual, for the House to investigate a congressional election because of a complaint by a single voter.“The Constitution is even thinner on this than it is on what impeachment would look like,” Whittington said. Advertisement  Ultimately, a majority vote on the House floor will settle who gets seated. The Senate also has total control over who gets seated and how to resolve disputes. Though contested statewide elections are less frequent, and the Senate has far fewer races to begin with, the majority would have the ultimate power to settle a disputed race.Neither party is talking about pursuing electoral challenges right now, but both suspect the other may do so. “I don’t trust Republicans to play fair, period,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said.“This is a disturbing potential implication of the electoral paranoia and lunacy that has been unleashed on the land by Donald Trump,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who sits on both the House Administration Committee and the committee investigating Jan. 6. “Anyone can try to create a conspiracy and spread it like wildfire on the internet without any facts at all. And then politicians in the GOP get cornered and feel as if they have to commit to a certain conspiracy theory or they’re going to get attacked by Trump and his followers.”McCarthy downplayed this possibility while entering the House chamber Tuesday, saying that there are often close races but his concern is Democrats trying to swing the results. Advertisement  Republicans point to Pelosi as the one who is upending norms by using her majority to kick Republicans off committees. The Democrat-controlled House voted to remove Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar from committee assignments last year for threatening or abusive comments they’d made.McCarthy also referenced the last time the House overturned a race, in 1985, when then-speaker Tip O’Neill and House Democrats handed a contested congressional seat to one of their own. In what has become known as a fight over Indiana’s “Bloody Eighth” district, House Democrats conducted their own recount, following tabulation errors and claims of vote irregularities. Republicans claimed Democrats were stealing the election and staged a walkout. “You always want to make sure you never end up to that Bloody Eighth when the Democrats stole the race,” McCarthy said.Pelosi openly considered using the House’s powers one year ago when a Democrat challenged her loss in an Iowa race that was decided by just six votes. Although the state certified Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks’ win over Democrat Rita Hart, Hart appealed to the House to investigate. Pelosi mulled seating Hart, but dropped it after several Democrats raised concerns and Hart withdrew her challenge.“If I wanted to be unfair, I wouldn’t have seated the Republican from Iowa because that was my right on the opening day. I would have just said, they’re not seated, and that would have been my right as speaker to do,” Pelosi said at the time. Advertisement  Republicans say Pelosi only backed down because she already had a majority secured. But if the 2022 midterms result in a close election where the majority hinges on only a seat or two? There could be chaos. Members from one party could object to the seating of members in another to block a majority, leading to retaliatory challenges in the other direction. It could take weeks to sort out who ultimately controls the chamber. As with much of the American political system, the rules offer no clear guideline for resolution if norms are abandoned.Republican Rep. Randy Weber said he believes state results should be upheld, but one side trying a power grab would be met with retaliation. If that happens with the majority in the balance, he said, “Get your seat early. Bring your popcorn.” ●

93,“There’s no such thing as too cautious at this point if we want to protect chronically ill or disabled people.”,"


Kayle Hill hasn’t left her apartment since Dec. 27. A 25-year-old disabled person, she’s taking isolation more seriously than ever before to avoid exposure to the contagious Omicron variant of COVID. She’s stopped her practice of making short visits to local spots, only goes outside to occasionally pick up curbside deliveries, and will miss a medical appointment to address pain this month.While nondisabled people may be calmed by the idea that Omicron is a less severe version of COVID, the threat of a highly transmissible version of a deadly infection is as scary as ever for people with weakened immune systems. And recent comments by top COVID leadership that flippantly passed over the very real threat COVID still poses to immunocompromised people were met with frustration from people like Hill. Advertisement     “It terrifies me to my core,” Hill said of this phase of the pandemic. “As immunocompromised people can never be sure that their body responded sufficiently to the vaccine, many of us — while so incredibly thankful for the vaccine and the layer of protection it provides — have to live as though we are in a pre-vaccine world.”Hill lives with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and degenerative disc disease in her back, as well as rheumatoid arthritis, for which she takes an immunosuppressant. She told BuzzFeed News it’s “absurd” that Omicron has been hailed as a “milder” version of the virus while she considers this time to be the most dangerous phase of the pandemic yet for the roughly 7 million immunocompromised people in the US.
 


The CDC has recommended that moderately or severely immunocompromised people receive a fourth shot of the COVID vaccine in 2022. But the sheer rapidity of the spread of Omicron has posed a very real immediate threat for people with immunosuppressive conditions because they can get sick more easily and are more likely to develop severe illness. A healthy immune response to the vaccine is needed to create protective antibodies, and therefore vaccines are less likely to be effective in people who are immunocompromised.People who live with a disability, chronic illness, or other immunosuppressive conditions have shared their message on social media that managing their risk shouldn’t only be up to them, using the #MyDisabledLifeIsWorthy hashtag started by disability activist Imani Barbarin.They have also adopted extreme protective measures to prevent COVID exposure, such as canceling or missing medical appointments, quitting jobs, or staying at home in self-imposed lockdown.“There’s no such thing as too cautious at this point if we want to protect chronically ill or disabled people,” Hill said.When she moved to Waterbury, Connecticut, in 2020, Hill struggled to find a pain management medical team that worked with Medicaid. But then she finally got a job with private insurance, found a new doctor, got an MRI, and was suggested a pain treatment plan involving occasional injections.“I was thrilled,” Hill said. “I was really looking forward to it.”But as the number of COVID cases rose in Waterbury, Hill decided to cancel the Jan. 19 appointment — she couldn’t risk exposure in the small waiting room that on previous visits had been very crowded.After she canceled, Hill broke down in tears knowing that she’d have to continue living in pain despite overcoming so many other barriers to getting the healthcare she needs.
 


Hill said she has “a lot of anger” toward the government because it has few plans of action other than widespread vaccination to combat COVID. While getting a shot is effective for people who don't have a disability, she said, it’s not possible for people like her to ever feel totally sure their body responded effectively to the vaccine. The government needs to back up vaccination with other elements, such as mask mandates and limited capacity in public spaces, she said, or else people with weakened immunity must continue living in fear of potentially severe infection.“With so few other mitigation strategies in place, community spread is beyond what we’ve seen before, again leaving immunocompromised people in a particularly vulnerable situation,” Hill said.Last week, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in an interview with Good Morning America that it was reassuring news that most of the people dying of Omicron were those with multiple comorbidities, or preexisting conditions.“Over 75% of deaths occurred in people with at least four comorbidities, so really these are people who are unwell to begin with,” Walensky said. “Really encouraging news in the context of Omicron.”But what sounds encouraging to a nondisabled person navigating the pandemic can actually mean an increased danger for people like Hill if it leads to the general public acting more recklessly.And exercising caution has put immunocompromised people in the balance of deciding which elements of healthcare they’re willing to put off to avoid a higher risk of exposure to COVID.“If I were to skip an infusion, my disease would become active and I’d end up hospitalized,” said Tessa Miller, a Brooklyn-based health journalist and author who is chronically ill. Miller lives with Crohn’s disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease where the immune system attacks the digestive tract. She also has celiac disease, an immune response to gluten that can also damage the small intestine.
 


Miller receives immunosuppressant infusions every six weeks at a chemotherapy center, and even though COVID is a risk, she said she can’t skip the appointments because they keep her chronic illness in check. Miller decided to put off other medical treatments, though, including seeing a neurologist to treat migraines caused by the infusion treatment until COVID cases go down.“Being hospitalized right now is my worst nightmare, not just because of the risk of COVID, but because the system is entirely overwhelmed and I don’t want to add to that,” she said.People with disabilities or chronic illnesses are “tired” from the pandemic, Miller said, adding that the CDC’s COVID messaging — though it hasn’t surprised her — treats disabled people as “disposable.”“If the pandemic has revealed anything, it’s that the economy comes before all else and that we should be willing to die for it,” Miller said. “It’s not only saying ‘We didn’t consider chronically ill and disabled people when we created these guidelines,’ but ‘We also don’t care if you die.’”Miller hasn’t socialized since February 2020. She didn’t experience a return to public transit rides or long-awaited vacations as nondisabled people have postvaccination. She said her world just feels “smaller and lonelier.”If chronically ill and disabled people had been sought for guidance from the start of the pandemic, she said there would have been more stringent measures to limit the virus’s spread. She said officials would have done things like pay people to stay home or get vaccinated, make remote work a standard, provide universal childcare, and study the long-term effects of COVID to anticipate a new group of people with disabilities.“We don’t know how else to say that our lives are worth living and that we’re worth listening to,” Miller said. “Had chronically ill and disabled people been looked to for guidance and leadership from the start of the pandemic, I can guarantee we’d be in a lot better shape than we are now.” Advertisement     Nondisabled people may find solace in sharing the idea that everyone will contract Omicron at some point so it can’t be that bad. But to Rumor Noelle, this is like saying to immunocompromised people that they should be getting ready for severe illness or death.Noelle, a 26-year-old full-time student in Hampton, New Hampshire, said it’s “extremely inaccessible” to even get a COVID test if you don't have a disability. Since they are living with cerebral palsy, someone has to drive them to get a PCR test, and home tests are extremely expensive given how much they’re already paying for medication and medical bills.
 


Noelle sees about seven doctors a month, but when they saw reports that some medical professionals were testing positive, they canceled appointments for January with a pain specialist and a surgery consultation to address pain in their legs and arms. Now they’ll have to buy extra pain relievers and ice packs until they can get another appointment.“As that gets worse, I still have to worry about what happens if I get COVID,” Noelle said, adding that it’s frustrating that people with disabilities even have to use a hashtag as a reminder they deserve to live.The only time Noelle leaves home is to go to their job as a receptionist — a job they started in December after giving up a previous position at a crowded restaurant due to the higher risk of COVID exposure. Now they’re considering quitting again because coworkers have come to the office with COVID symptoms. But leaving a job is scary, Noelle said, because it’s difficult to find an employer that will accommodate frequent medical appointments.“Disabled people have been right about everything in this pandemic,” Noelle said. “Everyone's a little desensitized and too OK with disabled people’s deaths. … It’s like we’re sacrificing disabled people to make room for the new disabled people who are here because of long COVID and COVID in general.” Advertisement     Peter Morley, 52, has lived with chronic pain and illnesses for 15 years, including lupus, and is a kidney cancer survivor. The New York–based patient advocate has left home as little as possible during the pandemic and has missed or rescheduled myriad medical appointments because he said he feels “too vulnerable” to COVID in a hospital setting.
 


“I have reprioritized my health issues and appointments, something I would never do pre-COVID-19,” Morley said.He’s overdue for an endoscopy for liver disease, which can only be done by a hepatologist at a hospital. But like Hill, Morley said he feared narrow corridors and other closed spaces in the hospital with people who could potentially be unvaccinated, aren’t masked, or aren’t social distancing.When he gets stressed about taking care of his body, “my diseases act accordingly,” Morley said. If his mental health triggers some of his conditions, it could lead to hospitalization, so he’s working with a therapist remotely, something he said not everyone in his position can access.“And it’s not just us that it terrifies — our caregivers are just as alarmed,” Morley said. “We are children, parents, grandparents, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, and we are your neighbors. We are not statistics.”
"
94,"The announcement is part of a plan to expand access to rapid testing, but most tests won’t be available for at least two weeks.","


The Biden administration announced Friday that it will double its supply of coronavirus rapid tests to a total of 1 billion and make those tests freely available online for every American household.Beginning Jan. 18, Americans can visit COVIDtests.gov to order up to four rapid tests per household (officials originally said ordering would be available Jan.19, but instead it went live a day early).The move comes as the US struggles with soaring COVID-19 cases caused chiefly by the Omicron variant, which has smashed case count and hospitalization records nationwide.Tests will be free. The only information required for purchase is a name and mailing address. But officials estimated that the tests would not ship until 7–12 days after purchase, meaning the soonest they could arrive in homes is Jan. 26. Advertisement     In early December, the Biden administration unveiled a winter strategy for the Omicron variant, focusing on more people getting boosters, more vaccinations for school-age kids, as well as requirements for private insurers to pay for at-home tests. Later in the month, Biden announced plans to open 20,000 free testing sites and to send federal medical teams to assist overloaded hospitals, which are now being deployed.But the requirement for private insurers to cover at-home tests does not go into effect until Jan. 15, meaning it has not helped pay for rapid tests during the holiday Omicron surge. The administration also came under fire as at-home test supplies ran short on pharmacy shelves over the holidays as Omicron cases skyrocketed. This led to the first plans to make 500 million free tests available to Americans, followed by Friday’s doubling of that figure.Nam Tran, a professor of clinical pathology at the University of California, Davis, said he welcomed Friday’s announcement and noted that any expansion of testing is good news, but he cautioned that people need to remember how to test appropriately. “We shouldn't be just testing out of overall anxiety concern, we should be testing for good reasons,” he said.According to the CDC, rapid tests should be used if you have COVID symptoms, if you’ve been in close contact with someone who has COVID, or if you will be gathering indoors with someone who is either at high risk for severe disease or is unvaccinated.But if you’re asymptomatic, Tran said, it’s critical to test more than once, at least 36 hours apart. “Testing multiple times, over time, allows you to catch the virus when it reaches that level that becomes detectable,” he said. This means the four tests per household would only be enough to get a meaningful result for two asymptomatic people.

95,“It’s still seen as something that’s a big deal when we just want a new pair of leggings.”,"


A plus-size woman who went viral after posing in a lime green athleisure outfit told BuzzFeed News that she hopes that one day we can get to a place where fat people buying clothes isn’t considered revolutionary.While plus-size mannequins have generally been embraced by brands and celebrated by activists as a step in the right direction for body acceptance, the sight of one didn’t seem to have the same impact on one conservative British TV host. Advertisement     “This, in a Regent St fitness store, is what obesity looks like. Flabby curves highlighted in hideous lime green velour,” tweeted Isabel Oakeshott, a GB News presenter who describes herself as a “professional feather ruffler.”The commentator criticized the window display at a London branch for Fabletics, which featured a plus-size mannequin dressed in a velour three-piece set, and called the body positivity movement “dangerous.”In response, Sophia Tassew, a content creator and business owner from London, served up the best reply when she shared a photo of herself looking fantastic in the “dangerous” outfit, which she went out to purchase for herself.
 


“That was my statement in itself,” Tassew told BuzzFeed News.“It's like, you guys are gonna have to get used to us. Thanks for sharing the fit. Now I'm going to cop it, and life goes on,” she said.The 24-year-old, who designs and owns a jewelry brand, wants it to be known that she “genuinely just liked the outfit.” She didn’t intend her response to be a major clapback, but Tassew said she recognizes that simply existing as a fat woman is seen by some as a statement.“Me, just being a plus-size person, I want a new outfit, and it's caused all this commotion, and it really shouldn't actually be that way, but it is,” Tassew said. “It's still seen as something that's a big deal, revolutionary, when we just want a new pair of leggings.”The reaction to her post has largely been positive, she said, noting that the store manager of that specific location told her that the mannequin in question has often prompted an emotional response from customers.“She gets people coming into her store crying because of the mannequin, and I was like, wow. So as long as it's done more good than anything, then I'm completely fine. I'm happy,” Tassew said.
 


Her post, which has more than 400K likes and over 30K retweets, prompted other women to share photos of themselves in the outfit.Tassew said that she no longer identified with the body positivity movement, calling them buzzwords and a movement that had been co-opted. Now, she champions the right to a quality of life.“I think my thing now is about fat liberation and just trying to understand how fat people can move around the world freely because obviously the world is not designed for us,” she said.The business owner has previously worked with the likes of fashion retailer Asos as a style insider and influencer, routinely modeling and creating content highlighting the best pieces for plus-size consumers.Since Tassew went viral, representatives for Fabletics have reached out to her. Fabletics, an athleisure brand cofounded by actor Kate Hudson, is routinely championed for having an inclusive offering, with sizes ranging from 0 to 24. Advertisement     Tassew is hopeful that her influence can be channeled into representing what it means to be fat in a world where anti-fat behavior persists.“It's so much deeper than just taking selfies to show your rolls,” Tassew said. “We're affected in so many ways that people don't actually realize, whether that be medically, financially, or socially.”

96,Newly unredacted claims from a 2020 antitrust lawsuit say that Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai personally approved an allegedly illegal 2018 advertising deal.,"


Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally signed off on a secret advertising deal that allegedly gave Facebook special privileges on Google’s ad platform, according to newly unredacted court documents filed on Friday.The allegation is from a complaint first filed in December 2020 by Texas and several other states against Google for engaging in ""false, deceptive, or misleading acts"" while operating its buy-and-sell auction system for digital ads. In the complaint, state attorneys general claim Google illegally teamed up with Facebook, its fiercest competitor in the digital advertising market, for a 2018 deal Google dubbed “Jedi Blue” in a reference to Star Wars. Advertisement     Prior to the alleged deal, Facebook appeared to threaten Google's dominance in the market by backing an ad-buying technique called ""header bidding.""""Google understood the severity of the threat to its position if Facebook were to enter the market and support header bidding,"" the complaint reads. ""To diffuse this threat, Google made overtures to Facebook."" In the end, Facebook backed off after Google agreed to give the social network ""information, speed, and other advantages"" in auctions run by Google, the complaint says.The newly unredacted version of the complaint shows that the deal was allegedly struck at the highest levels of the companies, a noteworthy level of cooperation from two of the most powerful companies in the world.“Google CEO Sundar Pichai also personally signed off on the terms of the deal,” the unredacted complaint reads.The complaint also says the team working on the deal directly addressed Zuckerberg in an email, saying the company was “nearly ready to sign” and needed “approval” to move forward. Zuckerberg wanted to meet with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg before making a decision. The executives’ names are redacted from the complaint, but their titles are visible. Advertisement     The revelation comes as both Google and Facebook face a crackdown from state and federal officials over antitrust concerns for their business practices. Earlier this week, a judge rejected Facebook's motion to dismiss a lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission that accuses the social network of using anticompetitive tactics.Google on Friday said the lawsuit, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, isn’t “accurate.”“We sign hundreds of agreements every year that don't require CEO approval, and this was no different,” Google spokesperson Peter Schottenfels said in a statement. “And contrary to AG Paxton’s claims, the fact of this agreement was never a secret — it was well-publicized. It simply enables FAN [Facebook Audience Network] and the advertisers it represents to participate in Open Bidding, just like over 25 other partners do.”Meta, Facebook’s parent company, echoed Google’s assertion that the deal didn’t single out Facebook.“Meta’s non-exclusive bidding agreement with Google and the similar agreements we have with other bidding platforms, have helped to increase competition for ad placements,” Meta spokesperson Stephen Peters said in a statement. “These business relationships enable Meta to deliver more value to advertisers while fairly compensating publishers, resulting in better outcomes for all.”Google says it plans to ask a judge to dismiss the case.

98,"Kim appears to be swapping extravagance for ease, and this is why it makes total sense.","Nearly a year since their split, and it looks like both Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are making the most of single life. As you may have heard, Kanye (now legally known as Ye) recently made his triumphant return to the dating circuit, going public with actor Julia Fox. After speculation about the nature of their relationship began swirling last month, Julia confirmed their romance last week, revealing in a blog post for Interview magazine that Ye had gifted her an entire hotel suite full of clothes on their second date. Since then, Ye and Julia have been practically inseparable, stepping out for numerous date nights and flaunting their newfound affection for one another at every possible occasion. And so, while her ex is pulling out all the stops for his new beau, it seems like Kim Kardashian is adopting a more casual approach to her love life. Off the back of Ye and Julia's well-documented debut, some Kardashian fans were left a little confused on Wednesday when Kim and her rumored boyfriend, Pete Davidson, were photographed enjoying an uncharacteristically low-key date night. On Tuesday evening, Pete and Kim — who were first romantically linked in October — ditched the typical celeb hot spots that LA has to offer, and opted for a chill dinner at a budget-friendly pizza chain. In stark contrast to Ye and Julia's recent date nights, Kim and Pete were photographed cozying up in a wooden booth as they shared pizza and sipped Diet Cokes. In keeping with the laid-back vibe, Kim swapped her usual Balenciaga statement looks for a dark sweater and leggings, blending in seamlessly with the other diners, who apparently barely noticed she was there. And for dessert, the casual duo relocated to a local Rite Aid drugstore where they grabbed some ice cream and engaged in a spot of PDA, before walking hand in hand back to their car — a refreshingly normal activity for two of the world’s most-talked-about people. To make matters more surprising, Tuesday night’s rendezvous wasn’t Kim and Pete’s only unusual outing this week. Just a day prior on Monday, an unsuspecting shopper snapped footage of the duo strolling around an outlet mall in Camarillo, California. The images were shared on social media and quickly published by Page Six, prompting a lot of confusion from fans. It still remains unclear what might attract a billionaire like Kim to an outlet mall, but nonetheless, it was reported that the couple paid a visit to a candy store where they picked up caramel apples and frozen bananas — a far cry from Kim's beloved Nobu. In years gone by, if you spotted Kim K browsing an outlet mall or nipping to a drugstore for a late-night ice cream run, you'd be forgiven for thinking that she might be lost. But — if her unlikely pairing with Pete was any indication — the past few months have shown that Kim is embarking on a totally new phase. And besides, as plenty of fans have pointed out, her revised outlook on life shouldn't come as a surprise. Fans of Keeping Up With the Kardashians might remember that Kim spoke incredibly candidly about the breakdown of her relationship with Ye in the show’s finale episode, which aired in June last year. During a sit-down conversation with Kris Jenner — which was reportedly filmed about a month before she filed for divorce in Feb 2021 — Kim reflected on what she learned from her marriage and her hopes for moving forward. So, reflecting on life in her 40s, Kim hinted that her professional success had been tainted by the struggles in her marriage, explaining that she had no one to share her life with. “I feel like I’ve worked so hard in life to achieve everything that I’ve wanted to, and I’ve lived up to my expectations and achieved 10 times more than I even thought was humanly possible,” she began. “But I don’t have a life to share that with.” “But turning 40 this year, I was like, No, I don’t want a husband that lives in a completely different state,” she said, referring to the fact that the latter months of their marriage were split between her home in LA and Ye's preferred base in Wyoming. “I used to think that [living apart] was when we were getting along the best, but to me that’s sad and that’s not what I want,” she said. At this stage in the conversation, Kim went on to talk candidly about what she wanted from a future partner, emphasizing that common interests were important to her. “I want someone where we have the same [TV] shows in common. I want someone that wants to work out with me,” she said. “Every single day, Khloé, Tristan, and I would work out at 6 a.m., and I was third-wheeling it for a good eight months in quarantine, and I was so envious of that.” If you’ve been following Kimye for a while, you’ll know that grand gestures were a huge part of their relationship. From renting out an entire baseball stadium to hosting private concerts in their home, it’s no secret that Ye spared no expense when it came to his wife. In fact, even as recently as October 2020 — just three months before news of their split surfaced — Ye marked Kim’s 40th birthday by surprising her with an eerily realistic hologram of her father, Robert Kardashian, who died in 2003. Shortly after this, it was reported that Kanye splashed out over $1 million on five Mercedes-Maybachs that he gifted Kim for Christmas, just a matter of weeks before their divorce went public. However, as she reflected on their years of marriage in the KUWTK finale, Kim realized that she had grown tired of Ye’s extravagance, and instead was yearning for the “smaller” and more meaningful experiences. “It’s the little things that I don’t have,” Kim said at the time. “I have all the big things. I have [everything] extravagant you could possibly imagine. And no one will ever do it like that [again]. I’m grateful for those experiences, but I think I’m ready for the smaller experiences that I think will mean a lot.” Which brings us to now, and Kim's new approach to romance hasn't gone unnoticed by fans. After she and Pete were spotted on their pizza date this week, fans were quick to highlight how the uncharacteristically low-key outing made them think of Kim's comments about the extravagance of her marriage to Kanye. “This reminds me of when Kim said little things are more important for her,” one person wrote on Instagram beneath a photograph of Kim and Pete sharing pizza. In agreement, another fan reflected on Kim’s sentiments about Kanye, theorizing that his grand gestures had perhaps been more performative than meaningful. ""The thing is that those big things are for the world to see but the little things is what your heart sees and appreciates the most,"" someone else wrote. What's more, another huge talking point of Kim and Kanye's split has been its impact on Kim's style and overall image. In light of her new approach to dating, some fans suggested that her seemingly more laid-back attitude appears to have manifested in her style, noting that her looks have been more ""relaxed"" and ""casual"" recently. On the whole, it seems like fans are definitely happy to see Kim finally getting to embrace the ""little things"" in her love life, praising her ""newly found happiness"" after a turbulent year. Of course, this doesn’t mean that Kim is completely giving up her lavish lifestyle — she and Pete took a trip to the Bahamas just a few weeks ago. But, as one fan pointed out, it's great to see Kim finding a happy balance. And even though they've yet to officially confirm their romance, there's plenty of evidence to suggest that things are going pretty well between this unlikely pair. ""He makes her laugh, plays around and has a sense of humor,"" a source told Entertainment Tonight this week. ""It is nice for Kim to be around that. Pete knows how to talk to Kim. He is the most confident guy, but not cocky. It is why it works with them."" So, while Kim and Pete's coupling may have initially come as a surprise, it was perhaps on the horizon all along."
99,"Several homeowners are accusing husband-and-wife home renovation duo Candis and Andy Meredith of promising renovations that ended poorly. The Merediths deny the claims and after an internal investigation, Magnolia Network says they “do not believe there was ill or malicious intent.”","


Teisha Hawley couldn’t believe her luck.The mother of three from South Jordan, Utah, had just won what she felt was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. She and her husband, Jeff, had been selected to have several rooms in their home renovated in October 2019 by an Instagram-famous couple, Candis and Andy Meredith, for a new television show. The Merediths, a couple from Utah with a blended family of seven children, had made a name for themselves in the DIY space with a 2015 HGTV show called Old Home Love, a 2017 book of the same name, and their project to convert a 20,000-square-foot 1907 schoolhouse into their family home.Candis told Hawley that the show, eventually called Home Work, would air on Magnolia Network, the soon-to-be-launched television network from Fixer Upper DIY superstars Chip and Joanna Gaines. According to Hawley, Candis told her that Joanna had personally looked at photos and said she liked the Hawleys’ house, which made Hawley feel like she was living “literally every person's dream.” Advertisement  For the Hawleys, the invocation of the Gaines name was everything. After Fixer Upper premiered on HGTV in 2013 and became the No. 1 unscripted series on all of cable television, the Gaineses have become the king and queen of home decor and renovation, with a line at Target and a series of stores and tourist attractions in their hometown of Waco, Texas. Earlier this month they officially launched their Magnolia Network as a joint venture with Discovery, with the aim of reclaiming “the best of what television can be.” Ahead of the launch, the network had premiered several shows from the network on Discovery Plus, including Home Work, which debuted with 13 episodes in July.
 


But to the Hawleys and three other homeowners who were selected in 2019 to be featured on Home Work, the network's launch was a different kind of milestone in what has become a multiyear fight.According to the Hawleys, their dream of a Magnolia-approved home renovation soon turned into a nightmare that left their kitchen, laundry room, and living room unusable, and the family down $35,000. Another homeowner, Aubry Bennion, has accused the Merediths of taking the $13,000 she paid them for a kitchen renovation and then leaving her project incomplete for months. When the renovation was completed, she claims the Merediths did a subpar job. Another pair of homeowners, Vienna and Rob Goates, said they paid the Merediths $50,000 for an addition to their home, but said the couple never completed any work. After this happened, the Goateses negotiated with the Merediths for a return of the money they paid, but have only been compensated for about a third of the deposit to date.On Wednesday, the Merediths posted a series of rebuttals to the claims of the three homeowners on their joint Instagram account. The Merediths denied many of the allegations against them, calling the “one-sided narrative” a series of “half truths and outright lies.” They said that while they understand home renovations can be difficult, they claim they did everything in their power to make their clients happy.“We have not heard from these clients in almost two years, and to have this come out publicly on the eve of the Magnolia network launch feels calculated and timed to hurt us the most. We have always been available for a resolution,” they said in part, adding, “We acknowledge that there were misunderstandings and hard conversations along the way, but just like with our many other happy clients, we did everything we could to resolve any issues that arose.”In a phone call with BuzzFeed News, Candis said the couple are “very proud of the work that we’ve done.”“We've never stolen anything and we’re not out to take anybody else’s livelihood away the same way ours has kind of been taken here,” she said. “And we’re very proud of the show.”Multiple requests for comment to the Gaineses went unanswered.The homeowners, some of whom connected via mutual acquaintances in Utah and began sharing notes, said they had fought to get the Merediths, Discovery, and Magnolia to answer their allegations, but had gotten nowhere. Finally, Bennion decided to go public in a social media Hail Mary. She posted her account of the renovation on her Instagram page on Jan. 5, and the other women soon followed as an act of solidarity.Bennion’s account went viral, and Discovery and Magnolia Network quickly announced that they would be pulling Home Work from the streamer.“Magnolia Network is aware that certain homeowners have expressed concerns about renovation projects undertaken by Candis and Andy Meredith,” Allison Page, the president of Magnolia Network, told BuzzFeed News in a statement. “Within the last several days, we have learned additional information about the scope of these issues, and we have decided to remove Home Work from the Magnolia Network line up pending a review of the claims that have been made.”However, late Thursday night, Magnolia Network announced that Home Work will be returning to the network. “After speaking with homeowners as well as Candis and Andy Meredith regarding renovation projects for Home Work, and hearing a mix of both positive and negative experiences, we do not believe there was ill or malicious intent,” Page told BuzzFeed News in a statement. “Our commitment now is to provide appropriate resolutions for those whose experience with Home Work fell short of our network’s standards.” An attorney for the Hawleys and Bennion told BuzzFeed News they are ""encouraged,"" by Discovery's apparent desire ""to do the right thing and correct the situation,"" while the Goatses told BuzzFeed News they ""are relieved to see that Magnolia has stepped in and committed to take action.""At the time of publication, a spokesperson for Discovery did not respond to further inquiries about the allegations made by the three homeowners. Discovery also did not respond to questions from BuzzFeed News about which production company was behind Home Work and who was responsible for its operations. An IMDb page for Home Work lists the Merediths and one other person as executive producers (this individual did not return a request for comment). Candis told BuzzFeed News the show was coproduced by her and her husband’s production company and one other company, but declined to name either. It’s also difficult to verify what the actual Home Work show looked like, as all episodes have been pulled from the streaming platform.For Bennion, the Hawleys, and the Goateses, the online response to their story has been bittersweet. They are pleased to finally be heard, but they want to know why they had to go so public to have anyone involved pay attention. “For Magnolia’s reputation to be on the line and for them to be so seasoned in doing what they do at Discovery, why would they allow these amateurs to do this and never check on them?” Bennion told BuzzFeed News. (Discovery did not respond to a request for comment on this allegation.)The Goateses, who appeared in a trailer for Home Work despite the fact that their project had not even started, said they want some accountability from Discovery and Magnolia.“I don’t think that the Merediths would have gotten as far as they did without the credibility of the Gaineses and Magnolia and their brand,” Vienna Goates told BuzzFeed News.
 


For Bennion, the experience with the Merediths has been doubly disappointing because she had previously had such a good relationship with the Magnolia brand.Bennion works in project management full time but runs a small business, Hello Maypole, which sells felt balls and garlands, on the side. She has sold her products at Magnolia vendor fairs and even wholesale at Magnolia stores, she said. She also had a friendly relationship with the Merediths through her business’s Instagram page.So when she heard from a mutual friend that the Merediths were partnering with Magnolia, and then saw the couple put a casting call for a yet-to-be-announced show on their Instagram, where they have more than 100,000 followers, she was intrigued. After making and submitting a video for consideration, Bennion got the news she had been selected to have her kitchen renovated.The Hawleys and the Goateses told BuzzFeed News they responded to the same casting call on social media. Hawley had followed the Merediths on Instagram for a while, and was thrilled to be chosen for the show. They said with Candis’s claim that Joanna Gaines had personally expressed interest in their home, they felt especially “solid” about signing up. (In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Candis denied ever telling the Hawleys that the Gaineses saw their house and said the Gaineses had nothing to do with the selection process.) Advertisement  “Hearing Magnolia and then Chip and Jo's name being dropped as much as it was, I felt like that really built a trust in everything,” Jeff Hawley told BuzzFeed News.“I remember just thinking like, wow, this is a big deal,” Vienna Goates said. “It was hard for us to comprehend it at that point. But we just knew it was going to be great.”
 


The Hawleys agreed to renovate their kitchen, dining room, family room, and laundry room — essentially an entire floor — for the show. The Merediths told them the renovation would cost $45,000, which seemed low to the Hawleys, but they said they figured the Merediths knew best.(Homeowners on television renovation shows pay for their own renovations most of the time, according to HGTV. The network states that the draw of being on their shows is primarily getting to work with their designers, not getting things for free.)The couple filmed introductions at their home with a film crew and the Merediths, and the demolition started on Oct. 30, 2019. Hawley was a little concerned that the demolition had started before they had sent any money or signed a contract, but she said Candis told her things moved fast in television and they would figure it all out.Besides, she thought, this was Magnolia.“Magnolia’s here, they’re demoing without [us paying] any money,” Hawley said she thought. “Of course this is legit, you know?”After contractors demolished their first floor, the Hawleys and their three children moved into the basement without a kitchen or laundry. They said that the Merediths told them it would take no longer than three or four weeks, so they figured they could make it work for a short period of time. In November they received a contract from the Merediths and a request for $35,000, the balance owed for the renovation (the remaining $10,000 would cover furniture costs).According to the Hawleys, the Merediths told them they needed to wire the money as soon as possible. This was stressful because the couple had planned to pay for the renovation with a home equity loan, but now didn’t have time to arrange it.“So this wasn’t something we were able to finance,” Teisha Hawley said, adding that they drew the balance directly from their savings account.The Hawleys said after that, things stalled. At first, they chalked it up to the holidays. Then, more time passed.“We would repeatedly be told contractors would be there a certain day to only then be told there were delays or someone had quit and that we needed to be patient,” Teisha Hawley wrote on Instagram. “Sadly our 3-4 week project was well into the 8-10 week range, we would have weeks go by without anyone coming or hearing a thing.” In the meantime, the family spent the holidays in their basement.“Living in the basement in Utah, when the weather is crappy and it’s snowy and dark, it takes a toll on you,” Hawley said.Across town, Bennion’s project for Home Work, which began the same month as the Hawleys, was also not proceeding as she had hoped. She had filmed the initial introduction with the Merediths for the show and said she had agreed to a $25,000 kitchen renovation that the Merediths said would take three weeks. Bennion wrote on Instagram that faced with the same timing issues and inability to get a home equity loan as the Hawleys, she had to borrow the funds from her parents.After demolition started on her kitchen, Bennion said the work also faced delays. She said she tried to put her faith in her prior relationship with the Merediths and the belief that things progressed differently on television, but she began to grow concerned as the project got more delayed. The morning of Thanksgiving 2019, the Merediths requested Bennion wire the funds. She sent them half, $13,000, the following Monday morning.
 


In mid-November, with no movement on the project, Bennion began pressing Candis for answers. After Candis showed her a vision board for the design for her home, she said she began to relax.“Seeing the design elements and the promise of a kitchen by Christmas was enough to keep the worries at bay and the momentum chugging, despite what was actually happening — or not — in my home,” she wrote on Instagram.However, Bennion said on Instagram, things continued to stall. As January turned into February, Bennion said she began to have “absolutely zero faith that any of it was real.”“I was certain I was being fed a line, the same line I had been for the three and a half months before with missing crews and poor work performed one or two days at a time, totaling less than two weeks of actual work days in my home,” she wrote. Advertisement  The Hawleys had also reached a crisis point. In early January, they met with the Merediths to discuss their project. According to the Hawleys, the Merediths told them they had already spent their entire budget and would now require another $35,000 to $40,000 to complete the work. The Merediths requested another $10,000 immediately via wire transfer in order to continue working on the project. The Hawleys were stunned.“Hopeless is the word that comes to mind when I think of that day,” Teisha Hawley wrote on Instagram. “I had applied for this show and had put our family in this situation.”The couple decided they were done. In February, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns, they told the Merediths they wanted to walk away. They said they had never signed their contract or any release allowing Magnolia Network to use their footage. They hired a contractor friend to get the rooms back into a “livable condition,” and have been slowly working on the project since. Two years later, the Hawleys said the experience with the Merediths has taken a toll.“The lack of communication, the lack of respect for our budget and the lack of respect for realizing my family was living in a basement truly makes me sick,” Teisha Hawley wrote on Instagram. Advertisement  
 


In response to the Hawleys’ claims, the Merediths said that the budget increases were due to requests from the Hawleys, saying the “scope changed mutually.” “There was a list of ‘must haves’ that kept growing, and it was clear we needed to sit down to discuss anything they were hoping to increase,” the Merediths wrote. They denied having any knowledge the Hawleys were unhappy until they received a demand letter from the couple’s attorney, but Candis declined to elaborate to BuzzFeed News what it said.“We tried to reach out and offer any and all assistance, we were ignored. We had spent about $10,000 of our own money at this point. We offered solutions. We haven’t heard from them whatsoever in almost two years,” they wrote. The Hawleys, in a statement, told BuzzFeed News they had no ulterior motive for coming forward. “This isn’t just about project delays and a poor renovation experience. There are patterns of manipulation, dishonesty, and gross negligence here,” they said. Advertisement  The Goates family also filmed an introduction for the show in October 2019, during which Candis told them their addition, which would add a much-needed second bathroom for their family of seven, would be featured in the grand finale episode of Home Work. The Goateses were thrilled by Candis’s appreciation for their beloved cottage.“She said, ‘This is the biggest project’ and … ‘I’ve always wanted to do a house like yours,’” Vienna Goates told BuzzFeed News. The couple felt that their project was important to the Merediths and the network, and, when Candis told them a few months later that Joanna Gaines had personally expressed interest in their project, they even felt like the Gaineses were invested. (In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Candis denied ever saying this.)These sentiments helped them look past a series of what they now call red flags with the project. Their renovation, the Goateses said, was beset with delays from the start. They had originally been told the project could possibly be wrapped by Christmas 2019, which came and went. It wasn’t until Jan. 29, 2020, Vienna Goates wrote on Instagram, that Candis finally told them “she’d met with all her contractors and was confident the project could go forward as planned.” The Goateses signed a contract and in February 2020 sent the Merediths a wire transfer for $50,000, half of the project’s total cost, as a deposit. They drew the funds from a home equity loan they had previously arranged.
 


According to the Goateses, still nothing happened. The couple said they frequently reached out for updates, but said Candis told them that COVID-19 was causing project delays. Finally, they heard a concrete update from Candis when, on April 29, 2020, she shared a trailer for Home Work with them. The Goateses said they were stunned to see themselves featured, as they had assumed they wouldn’t be making the cut because of the project delays.“We felt this was an effort to placate our anxiety,” Rob Goates told BuzzFeed News. “Because at this point, I was like, have we been robbed? Is this some sort of con?” But seeing themselves in the preview made them feel more confident that their renovation would start soon.“That solidified at that point Chip and Joanna know what we're going through, and they’re excited about us because there we are on their channel,” Vienna Goates said.The couple’s relief was short-lived. In May, Rob Goates was laid off from his job, and no work had begun. The couple began to question if they should pull out of the project for financial reasons, but they said Candis convinced them to stay the course.“[Candis] was very kind and she said she’d spoken to production and they agreed they would make our HELOC [home equity line of credit] payments for us and help us financially so we could go forward with the project,” Vienna Goates wrote on Instagram. “Candis said that Joanna Gaines specifically had interest in our project, and that they all really wanted our renovation to continue to be on the show.”But by September 2020, with the renovation still not underway and money tight, the Goateses decided to quit.“You may think it was naive and foolish of us to let things go on even this long,” Vienna Goates wrote on Instagram. “You would be right. But a global pandemic makes a convenient excuse for many things, and honestly we were in absolute survival mode. Plus, we had faith in the reputation of Chip and Joanna and their beloved Magnolia brand and Candis’s repeated assurances that everything would work out.”Since then, the Goateses said, they have been fighting to get back the deposit they sent the Merediths. They hired a lawyer and Candis agreed to a judgment that stated the couple could sue if she did not refund the money. According to the Goateses, so far they have been refunded about $14,000 by the Merediths. Rob Goates estimates they have spent upward of $60,000 total on the debacle, including lawyer’s fees. They aren’t sure they will ever get their full deposit back.“There’s nothing quite like paying a bill on a huge balance that is literally for NOTHING,” Vienna Goates wrote on Instagram, referring to their home equity loan.In their rebuttal, the Merediths claimed that after the Goateses asked for their deposit back, the unnamed contractor, whom they had paid the $50,000 to, told them he could not refund the money. So, they said, they agreed to refund the Goates family personally, confirming they had thus far paid them $14,000. “We care deeply about the Goates and we are taking this responsibility seriously,” they wrote.In response to the Merediths' public posting, the Goateses told BuzzFeed News, “We appreciate that they recognized the validity of our situation … however, there has been a lack of regular communication and transparency.“We tried every avenue possible to resolve this privately, our story and our paper trail speaks to that, and speaking out publicly was an extremely unfortunate last resort,” they said.Through word of mouth and mutual acquaintances, the Hawleys eventually connected with Bennion and began to share notes. Bennion’s renovation had also ended poorly, she told BuzzFeed News. In February, she had met with Candis, telling her she planned to quit the show and the project if it didn’t improve.During the meeting, Bennion wrote on Instagram, Candis told her that her project was now also costing way more than expected: $40,000. According to Bennion, Candis also said she had already spent the money. In their rebuttal, the Merediths claim they paid $32,000 of their own funds toward completing the project.“We’ve been using our own money and we can’t really afford to feed our kids,” Bennion said Candis told her. In response, Candis told BuzzFeed News that the remark was “taken out of context,” but fronting the costs of Bennion’s renovation did “put us into tricky situations with our family.”Although she was furious, Bennion believed she had leverage. “From my perspective, she needed my project to be complete more than I needed her to complete it for me,” Bennion wrote on Instagram, adding she believed this because she knew that couples had dropped out of the show. “As such, she was willing to push the financial conversation down the road a bit more, even after I told her she was working at risk.”The Merediths’ contractors eventually finished the kitchen and Bennion filmed a reveal for the show, but she said she never signed a contract or an appearance release for Magnolia. According to Bennion, the finished product has been rife with problems and shoddy work.“I’ll never show the finished product on the internet because it cleans up nice and, with the right filter, is worthy of every wow and word of praise for everyone who doesn’t have to live in it or had to live through what it took to get there,” she wrote on Instagram.The Merediths fiercely denied Bennion’s allegations on Instagram, saying, “[Bennion’s Instagram handle] has made false claims and is purposely trying to take anything she can from us.” They claimed the renovation of her kitchen was done well and posted several videos that they claimed showed Bennion happy with the end result.“We are very proud of the work that went into this project,” they wrote. “We revealed this space on February 20, 2020 and fully acknowledge that before this point in time there were hard conversations and misunderstandings about this project and budget, but we were absolutely under the impression that we had resolved those issues together. If Aubry was unhappy at this point overall, we had no idea whatsoever.”Candis told BuzzFeed News that the majority of Bennion’s complaints about the project’s delays were out of her control as the delays were because of the contractors and workers. She said she and Andy decided not to attempt to recoup the $32,000 they spent of their own money on Bennion’s project because they “didn't want that kitchen to feel anything but positive for her overall.”“I just wanted her to feel at peace. And if that meant that I had spent that money, that was OK,” she said. Bennion told BuzzFeed News that while she did feign excitement during parts of the project, “It is easy to be selective in memory. The truth is that there are many text messages, which I still have record of, that show I was very dissatisfied regularly throughout the project.”
 


Since the homeowners began to share notes in spring 2020, they said they have been working to figure out some sort of restitution. Both the Hawleys and Bennion said they consulted attorneys, who told them even if they had a judgment against the Merediths, it’s unlikely they would ever see a dime. In addition to consulting attorneys, they also in 2021 filed complaints against the couple with the Utah Department of Commerce’s Consumer Protection Division.“We did everything in our power to contact everybody we could to make sure that this was taken care of and nothing was ever addressed or taken care of or anything,” Teisha Hawley said.
 


For a long time, the Goateses said they told themselves that Magnolia, Discovery, and the Gaineses couldn’t possibly know what had happened. If they knew, they thought, they would do something to fix it. In August 2021, they decided to attempt to contact the network and Magnolia, emailing a customer service line. They got a response from an attorney for Discovery, who told them in an email, reviewed by BuzzFeed News, that the network would encourage the couple to address their concerns directly with the Merediths.“We do not believe it would be helpful for Discovery to try and mediate this matter, especially since counsel is already involved and you have already sought legal recourse,” the attorney wrote in part. The attorney added that the network understood that the Merediths would “like to resolve the outstanding balance that is owed.”“At that point, we just hung our heads and cried because we were like, what more can we do?” Rob Goates told BuzzFeed News.All the homeowners said they have been validated by the response on social media to their stories, although going so public has taken a toll. Since Bennion and the others’ accounts went viral, a Utah real estate agent, Aaron Oldham, posted an hourlong IGTV video describing what he said was his own poor experience working with the Merediths on a renovation in 2013. Commenters on Oldham’s video also began to do their own sleuthing on the couple, highlighting a 2020 lawsuit against them for appearing as celebrity endorsers for the real estate seminar company Zurixx.While Bennion said she has appreciated the support, she was disappointed about how difficult it was to get Magnolia Network to respond to her claims. Since she had never interacted with anyone from the network directly, she said, she initially had no contact to seek restitution from.Finally, through her contacts on the purchasing side of the Magnolia company, she said she was connected with Magnolia’s attorney and asked them if she could break an NDA she signed as part of her wholesale agreement to share her story. Bennion shared her experience with the Magnolia team, who, she said, blamed the issue on the show’s production company. The Hawleys said they also contacted Magnolia through their attorney, but said they were told the network said it was not its responsibility.Bennion said she has found the experience hard to reconcile with the version of the Magnolia brand she had loved.“Magnolia shouldn’t be surprised because we gave them a fair shake to do their part,” she said.But when the show rolled around, they began to question how much they had been “taken advantage of.”“As the show launched and we saw how happy and successful and fun it was and we were just left out in the cold, that was really violating,” Rob Goates said.Hawley said she just wants someone to be accountable for what happened to her.“What I have posted, it’s not to trash Magnolia,” Hawley told BuzzFeed News. “I just want them to be better. Their name, people across the entire country trust it. And so the fact that this has happened under their brand is just devastating to me.” ●

100,"""As part of its plans, Russia is laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating a pretext for invasion, including through sabotage activities and information operations.""","


KYIV — After Russia massed some 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border in recent weeks, the Biden administration said it believes Moscow is preparing to again invade its Eastern European neighbor.“The United States is concerned that the Russian government is preparing for an invasion into Ukraine that may result in widespread human rights violations and war crimes should diplomacy fail to meet their objectives,” a US official told BuzzFeed News on Friday. Advertisement     “As part of its plans, Russia is laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating a pretext for invasion, including through sabotage activities and information operations, by accusing Ukraine of preparing an imminent attack against Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.”The statement, on the heels of unsuccessful high-stakes negotiations between the US, NATO, and Russia, was Washington’s strongest and most ominous yet on the latest Russian aggression targeting Ukraine.It also echoes a report published earlier Friday by Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense. That report warned that Russian special services are preparing a provocation against Russian soldiers and targeting an arms depot in the Transnistrian region of Moldova where Putin has peacekeepers. The goal, the intelligence agency said, was also to create an excuse to launch an attack on Ukraine.The US official said intelligence showed the Russian military plans to begin its activities “several weeks before a military invasion, which could begin between mid-January and mid-February.”“We saw this playbook in 2014 with Crimea,” the official added, referring to Moscow’s annexation of that peninsula and the subsequent war it fomented in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.US intelligence, said the official, indicates Russia has already recruited a group of operatives to carry out a false-flag operation in eastern Ukraine.“The operatives are trained in urban warfare and in using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia’s own proxy-forces,” the official said.The official said further information indicated that “Russian influence actors” working for state-run news outlets and on social media are hard at work fabricating “Ukrainian provocations” to justify a new Russian intervention and sow discord in Ukraine. Advertisement     “For example, Russian officials and influence actors are emphasizing narratives about the deterioration of human rights in Ukraine and the increased militancy of Ukrainian leaders,” the official said.“These media narratives also blame the West for escalating tension, highlight humanitarian issues in Ukraine that Russian intervention could solve, and promote Russian patriotism to encourage domestic support for military action.”The Biden administration told BuzzFeed News that in December it tracked Russian-language content on social media “covering all three of these narratives” and saw its output increase to an average of about 3,500 posts per day — a 200% increase from the daily average in November.The US warnings came as a massive cyberattack hit dozens of Ukrainian government websites. The hackers behind the attack posted a message warning Ukraine to “be afraid and expect worse.”Ukrainian government officials told BuzzFeed News that it was too soon to know for sure who was behind the attack, but they pointed the finger at Moscow.

101,"“I hate to burst my sister’s bubble, but my book is not about her. I can’t help that I was born a Spears too... I’ve built my career in spite of just being someone’s little sister.”","


Jamie Lynn refuted Britney’s claim shortly after the testimony, and instead maintained that she’s always “loved” and “supported” her sister.
 


“When [the conservatorship] was put into place I was a 17-year-old. I was about to have a baby, so I didn’t understand what was happening,” she said. “Nor was I focused on that. I was focused on the fact that I was a 17-year-old about to have a baby. I understand just as little about it then as I do now.”
 


“There was no me overseeing funds or something like that, and if that was, it was a misunderstanding,” she said. “Either way, I took no steps to be a part of it.”“I went out of my way to make sure that she had the contacts she needed to possibly go ahead and end this conservatorship, and just end this all for our family,” she said. “If it’s gonna cause this much discord, why continue it?”“If she wanted to talk to other people ... I set that up. I even spoke to her legal team ... previous legal team, and that did not end well in my favor,” she added.
 


“It’s messy, and I’m working through it,” Jamie Lynn said of her current relationship with her father. “I have good days and bad days.”“I think the relationship stands as that he’s still my father, and I have to acknowledge that in a responsible way,” she said.
 


“I was doing a tribute to honor my sister and all the amazing things that she’s done,” Jamie Lynn said. “I don’t think she’s personally upset with me about that. Truthfully, I don’t know why that bothers her.”
 


“She was never around me much in that time so why are they even talking about that unless she wants to sell a book at my expense ???” she asked.
 


“If you were me, you might understand asking for 13 years for remixes to go into a small venue show and on tours !!! 13 years later they assign me as the MOTHER OF ALL ... heart of gold ... Britney sitting there seeing a 15 minute performance of everything I have ever wanted ... But see, I always was the bigger person,” she continued.“They all got to DO IT and PLAY ME and I always sat there and took it. But see, now it’s a joke … the last thing I would ever do is ask for what was just given to her !!! So yes, they did ruin my dreams,” she wrote.“I do remember asking my sister why she did that when she knew I was waiting to change my show and her only words were “Well, it wasn’t my idea” ... Hope your book does well, Jamie Lynn !!!” Britney added.
 


“I know you’re going through a lot and I never want to diminish that, but I also can’t diminish myself,” she added.
 


“[Because] now it’s getting harder for me to rationalize to my oldest daughter why our family continues to get death threats, as a result of their aunt’s vague and accusatory posts, especially when we know she could tell the truth, and put an end to all of it in one second if she wanted to,” the statement continued.
 


“I’ve worked hard since before I was even a teenager, and I’ve built my career in spite of just being someone’s little sister,” she added.
 


“I’m speaking my truth to heal my traumas, so I can close this chapter and move forward and I wish my sister could do the same,” she said.“No matter what comes, I will always love my big sister, and be here for her. It’s time to put an end to the unhealthy chaos that has controlled my life for so long,” she wrote.
 


Some suggested that, in light of her comments about the weight her last name carries, Jamie Lynn might be attempting to distance herself from the Spears name considering the recent backlash.

102,House and Senate races can be overturned by a majority vote.,"


WASHINGTON — America may not have to wait until 2024 to witness the next attempt to undo a free and fair election.Any candidate for the 435 House seats or 34 Senate seats open in 2022 could follow Donald Trump’s playbook for challenging a lost election, which Republicans have spent the last 14 months building out. And they would have a major advantage over the former president: Overthrowing congressional election results is actually very simple. There’s no need to deal with the Electoral College or state officials across the country. You just need to convince a majority of politicians in either chamber.The House and Senate have absolute authority over their membership. And the House speaker can simply decide not to seat a candidate whose election has been called into question, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi herself considered just last year. Advertisement  All that is required to ignore or overturn a congressional election is a move away from a century of political norms at a time many politicians are actively undermining them.Republicans in and out of Congress continue to prop up the lie that the last election was stolen from Trump and continue to make challenging certified election results routine. After 147 Republicans in Congress voted not to certify the 2020 election results, legislators in four states have launched so-called election “audits” of their own. Election deniers are running to be the top elections officials in at least 12 states in 2022. And Trump’s most vociferous supporters in the party are pushing legislation in statehouses this year to make it easier to force partisan audits in future elections up and down the ballot.While those efforts could certainly help Republicans in the next presidential election, they could take advantage this year of the new normal they’ve created. Poll after poll shows that roughly two-thirds of Republican voters still believe that President Joe Biden’s election was illegitimate and a December Washington Post survey shows that 57% of them are not confident that the 2022 vote will be counted accurately. The question isn’t whether another Republican will cry voter fraud and try to overturn a fair congressional election, it’s when — and whether party leaders will step in to help them.Over the past century, it has been extremely rare for Congress to overturn state-certified elections. Modern Congresses have tended to defer to the states and the courts to sort out contested elections, Princeton University professor of politics Keith Whittington said. But in the 19th century, it was much more common for the Senate and House to settle disputes themselves, with a majority vote being the ultimate arbiter. Advertisement  With state election boards under siege for the past year by Trump and his supporters, the standard of Congress leaving it to the states could soon be over.“You can imagine either chamber wanting to go back to its roots,” Whittington said.Trump remains the X factor hanging over the midterms. He is encouraging Republicans to keep false voter fraud claims alive in 2022, and a good number of the party’s voters expect their candidates to push back on election results. In the Washington Post survey, nearly a third of Republicans said they were not confident that officials in their states would accept the results of the 2022 election — and that’s in states controlled mostly by Republicans. Asked about states controlled by mostly Democrats, that number shot up to 56%.It’s easiest to see how this could play out in the House, where hundreds of races present more radical members with more opportunity. Say a handful of Republicans lose House races in November and claim that there was widespread voter fraud in their districts. Republicans are considered the favorites to win the majority back in 2022, meaning the next speaker — perhaps current Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy — could come under intense pressure to “stop the steal” in races across the country. He — and the rest of the Republicans in Congress — would likely be flooded with calls demanding “full forensic audits.” Advertisement  For this scenario to play out, Republicans have to win back a majority in the House of Representatives. That would allow them to elect one of their own because the speaker of the House has the power to seat — or not seat — any member in a contested race. Democrats could challenge that decision, but Republicans would only need a majority vote to uphold it.Usually there are more steps in the process. Under the Federal Contested Election Act of 1969, a losing candidate can appeal to the Committee on House Administration to start an investigation, for which there are no real ground rules, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The committee can send a delegation to the disputed district to recount the ballots themselves. They could conduct their own quasi-audit and impound voting machines and examine voter registration records. They could hold a trial, with both candidates presenting evidence for why they should be seated. And they can make up whatever rules they’d like about which ballots to count and which not to count, regardless of state law. The courts, historically, have stayed out of this; the Constitution guarantees that each chamber of Congress “shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members.”The House doesn’t even need a candidate to complain to kick off this process — any member or member-elect can object to the seating of another member. It’s even possible, though very unusual, for the House to investigate a congressional election because of a complaint by a single voter.“The Constitution is even thinner on this than it is on what impeachment would look like,” Whittington said. Advertisement  Ultimately, a majority vote on the House floor will settle who gets seated. The Senate also has total control over who gets seated and how to resolve disputes. Though contested statewide elections are less frequent, and the Senate has far fewer races to begin with, the majority would have the ultimate power to settle a disputed race.Neither party is talking about pursuing electoral challenges right now, but both suspect the other may do so. “I don’t trust Republicans to play fair, period,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said.“This is a disturbing potential implication of the electoral paranoia and lunacy that has been unleashed on the land by Donald Trump,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who sits on both the House Administration Committee and the committee investigating Jan. 6. “Anyone can try to create a conspiracy and spread it like wildfire on the internet without any facts at all. And then politicians in the GOP get cornered and feel as if they have to commit to a certain conspiracy theory or they’re going to get attacked by Trump and his followers.”McCarthy downplayed this possibility while entering the House chamber Tuesday, saying that there are often close races but his concern is Democrats trying to swing the results. Advertisement  Republicans point to Pelosi as the one who is upending norms by using her majority to kick Republicans off committees. The Democrat-controlled House voted to remove Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar from committee assignments last year for threatening or abusive comments they’d made.McCarthy also referenced the last time the House overturned a race, in 1985, when then-speaker Tip O’Neill and House Democrats handed a contested congressional seat to one of their own. In what has become known as a fight over Indiana’s “Bloody Eighth” district, House Democrats conducted their own recount, following tabulation errors and claims of vote irregularities. Republicans claimed Democrats were stealing the election and staged a walkout. “You always want to make sure you never end up to that Bloody Eighth when the Democrats stole the race,” McCarthy said.Pelosi openly considered using the House’s powers one year ago when a Democrat challenged her loss in an Iowa race that was decided by just six votes. Although the state certified Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks’ win over Democrat Rita Hart, Hart appealed to the House to investigate. Pelosi mulled seating Hart, but dropped it after several Democrats raised concerns and Hart withdrew her challenge.“If I wanted to be unfair, I wouldn’t have seated the Republican from Iowa because that was my right on the opening day. I would have just said, they’re not seated, and that would have been my right as speaker to do,” Pelosi said at the time. Advertisement  Republicans say Pelosi only backed down because she already had a majority secured. But if the 2022 midterms result in a close election where the majority hinges on only a seat or two? There could be chaos. Members from one party could object to the seating of members in another to block a majority, leading to retaliatory challenges in the other direction. It could take weeks to sort out who ultimately controls the chamber. As with much of the American political system, the rules offer no clear guideline for resolution if norms are abandoned.Republican Rep. Randy Weber said he believes state results should be upheld, but one side trying a power grab would be met with retaliation. If that happens with the majority in the balance, he said, “Get your seat early. Bring your popcorn.” ●

104,“it’s giving kendall jenner pepsi.”,"


This is an excerpt from Please Like Me, BuzzFeed News’ newsletter about how influencers are battling for your attention. You can sign up here.The North Star Boys first appeared on my TikTok feed last summer, exiting an elevator and throwing nonchalant but sexy glances at the camera. Then ripping off their shirts. Standing in a line sucking on lollipops. Eating whipped cream. Fabricating secret admirer videos about themselves. Every time, I would be introduced to their content via someone’s satirical take on their Horny Behavior. Advertisement     This collective of seven Asian American content creators first rose to prominence for “go girl give us nothing” seductive TikToks, garnering a large fanbase by pushing the boundaries of fan fiction and TikTok’s community guidelines. The North Star Boys’ account currently boasts 4.8 million followers, while individual members like Oliver Moy have around 11.6 million.According to the group’s YouTube channel, their mission is simply “to be an inspiration to Asian Americans.” Euphemistically, they’ve become known as the “pick your Asian” group, a way for Asian men to fetishize themselves for white audiences. But recently these purveyors of thirsty heterosexual Asian content found themselves in political controversy after they posed in front of a wall with the slogan “Stop Asian Hate.”
 


The Stop Asian Hate movement gained traction in 2021 after a rise in racist and violent attacks against Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was largely personified by rallies organized across the country to protest the brutality and show solidarity, particularly in the wake of Vicha Ratanapakdee’s death as well as the Atlanta spa shooting.Which is why followers didn’t love it when the North Star Boys used it as a backdrop for their latest group photo. “it’s giving kendall jenner pepsi,” one commenter wrote. “i’d rather be called a slur,” another said.
 


The viral photo also spawned several TikToks making light of it, including one by Alex Lee, 20, a student at the University of Southern California.“It was comical, and then once you think about it more, maybe a little more concerning,” he told me. “This term reached new heights in its meaning during COVID-19, when Asian elders and community members were really under attack, physically and verbally abused for our identity. But these seven guys are looking cute in front of it.”In response to the uproar, the influencers posted two response videos, on TikTok and YouTube. “That is not a thirst trap. And we are not activists, nor do we try to be,” said Oliver Moy, his fellow Boys seated around him.
 


The caption on TikTok read: “To those who are mocking us with your TikToks, I want to ask you to ask yourself, ‘What are you doing for the movement?’”And, well, the commenters mocked that too.
 


“When influencers use these hashtags as a way to prove they’re ‘woke,’ without clarifying the action items they’re following to benefit the movement, people lose sight of the meaning,” Lee said. “The words lose impact, and that becomes detrimental to the purpose of these terms.”The founders of Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of organizations who founded and popularized the initial hashtag, declined to respond directly about the North Star Boys’ controversial post, but provided a statement about the movement’s work tracking Asian hate crime incidents.“It's vital we continue to push for real solutions through investment in civil rights, community resources and education, including ethnic studies in schools,” they said.Influencers taking lukewarm, Instagram-friendly stands against targeted racial violence is not a new phenomenon (remember the black squares?). The pressures of social media aesthetics have led these efforts to be diluted into general phrases, the action items left behind. Male influencers doing a sexy walk with pumpkins on their heads is not really the inspiring Asian representation I had asked for.“You need to tell your teammate when they make a bad decision on the court,” Lee said. “We have the same goal as Asian Americans. I don’t think the North Star Boys had bad intentions. I really don’t think they were trying to be malicious or derogatory. But they just had lackluster execution.”In a statement to BuzzFeed News, the North Star Boys collectively said:We as Asian Americans stand in solidarity with our community, and only want to use our platform to promote positivity and inclusivity. It's not just Asian Americans out there that we want to inspire, but everyone should feel that they can talk about what they're passionate about, be heard, and more importantly feel seen and represented culturally when they get on social media or watch TV. We are always so thankful for all of our supporters for having our back. We see all your messages and appreciate the love.I mean, public figures supporting a movement is a nice gesture, but the state of our community may need a little more than that.

106,"The attack comes as Russia is massing 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border.","


KYIV – After days of unsuccessful negotiations between the US, NATO, and Russia, hackers took down dozens of Ukrainian government websites and posted an ominous warning on several for the country to “be afraid and expect worse.”The cyberattack occurred overnight on Thursday and Friday morning, and it took down more than a dozen official websites, disrupting government work and raising questions about whether Russia was signaling that a new offensive against Ukraine was getting underway. Advertisement     Oleh Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry, told BuzzFeed News that government specialists were working to restore the websites Friday morning and the Ukrainian Cyberpolice Department had opened a criminal investigation. “It’s too early to draw conclusions,” he said. ""We are assessing the damage caused by the attack.""But some in Ukraine’s government see Russian fingerprints all over the attack and are already blaming Moscow, which has massed around 100,000 soldiers near the Ukrainian borders and threatened a “military response” against its neighbor unless the US and NATO concede to its demands.“It’s pretty obvious [Russia is responsible] because hardly anyone else has the motive for such actions,” a Ukrainian official told BuzzFeed News on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak on the sensitive matter.Andriy Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelensky’s chief of staff, during an online event with the Atlantic Council think tank, stopped short of accusing Russia of the cyberattack by name but suggested that it had a role in it. “It’s one of the potential parts of the destabilization of Ukraine,” he said. Advertisement     Officials in Russia didn't immediately return a request for comment.Ukrainian and US officials have warned that if Russia were to launch a fresh invasion of Ukraine it would likely do so in conjunction with cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Thursday that the US intelligence community has information that suggests Russia is laying the groundwork to fabricate a pretext for invading Ukraine.A source with knowledge of recent cybersecurity initiatives in Ukraine told BuzzFeed News hours before the cyberattack that Kyiv and Washington had recently seen a “substantial uptick” in Russian cyber activity targeting Ukrainian systems and planting malware.The source said there was evidence to show the malware was designed to be planted and remain idle until a command would be given by the hackers behind it. “So they don’t need to hack anything when the [shooting] war starts. … The hack already happened,” the source explained. “They just push the button.”“We call this preparing the battlefield,” the source said.
 


Most of the Ukrainian websites targeted late Thursday and early Friday registered error messages when visited. But hackers replaced the homepage on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website with a message written in Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish. “[Every] Ukrainian!” it said. “All information about you has become public, be afraid and expect the worst. This is for your past, present and future.”The message also included references to Ukrainian nationalist fighters in World War II and atrocities committed by them against Poles at the time, which has been a point of tension between the two countries despite their close relationship. Some Ukrainians saw that as a ruse to blame Warsaw for the attack. Advertisement     The Cyberpolice Department said it is working with the State Special Communications Service and the Security Service of Ukraine “to collect digital evidence and identify those involved in the cyber attacks.” No personal or official government data was stolen in the attack, it added.Ukraine has been the target of several large-scale cyberattacks since 2014, the year Russia forcibly annexed Crimea and fomented the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. Kyiv has repeatedly insisted that the attacks are part of Moscow’s “hybrid war” — a combination of cyberwarfare, disinformation, and conventional military warfare — against it. Russia has denied responsibility for the cyberattacks.Past incidents saw attacks on the Ukrainian power grid, government agencies, transportation systems, and businesses. A 2017 attack known as NotPetya emanated in Kyiv but quickly spread to companies across the globe, causing significant damage.The New York Times reported last month that the US and UK had sent experts to Kyiv to help Ukraine on the cyber front, foreseeing the likelihood of cyberattacks as Russia ratcheted up tensions with its neighbor.President Vladimir Putin has gathered some 100,000 troops and heavy artillery around the border of Ukraine, raising concern in Kyiv and Western capitals that the Kremlin might be preparing to invade anew. Moscow has denied it is prepping for an attack and said that what it does with its military within its borders is its business.High-stakes discussions between the US, NATO, and Russia in Geneva, Brussels, and Vienna this week failed to secure a deal to see Moscow pull back its troops and military equipment.Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told reporters Thursday that Washington and NATO “are not ready to meet"" Russia's ""key requirements.” Among those is a guarantee that Ukraine can never join the western military alliance. The US and Ukraine have called the demand a non-starter.Ryabkov and other Russian government officials said further talks would be useless.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg delivered an ominous warning following a meeting with the Russians in Brussels on Wednesday. “There is a real risk for new armed conflict in Europe,” he said.

107,"After his meeting with senators, President Biden indicated that changes to the filibuster rules — and passing the voting rights package — are not looking likely.","


President Joe Biden acknowledged for the first time Thursday that Democrats will likely fail to pass voting rights reforms, in the wake of dozens of restrictive voting laws passed by Republicans across the country.“Like every other major civil rights bill that came along, if we miss the first time we can come back and try the second one,"" he said. ""We missed this time. We missed this time.”After traveling to Georgia earlier this week — in spite of the protests of several voting rights leaders on the ground there — Biden visited Capitol Hill on Thursday to make a push for Democratic senators to amend filibuster rules, which would have paved the way for two landmark voting reform bills. Advertisement     But after his meeting with senators, the president indicated that changes to the filibuster rules — and passing the voting rights package — are not looking likely.“I hope we can get this done, but the honest to god answer is I don’t know whether we can get this done,” Biden said.Normally a bill requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster and pass the Senate. Democrats have only a 50–50 majority, including the tiebreaker, and hoped to carve out a narrow exemption to the filibuster to allow voting rights bills to pass with a simple majority.At least two Democratic senators, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, oppose this plan, dropping Democrats short of the votes they would need. Sinema gave a speech Thursday morning saying she supports the voting rights bills, but not changing the Senate rules to pass them. She said nuking the filibuster would contribute to the “disease of division” that has broken American politics.Democrats appear poised to forge ahead with a vote anyway, knowing they don’t have the numbers. It’s exceedingly rare in the Senate for a majority party to set up a vote it knows it will lose, but Democrats say this issue is unique.“I think there are certain fundamentals that are beyond the usual sort of strategy approach around here. You’re either for democracy or you’re not,” Sen. Martin Heinrich said. “It’s important to have, frankly, every one of us on the record.”Republicans are taking a more grounded view of the Democrats’ doomed push.“It makes perfect political sense,” Sen. Lindsey Graham said. “If you’re Joe Biden, you’ve got to show the left that you did everything in your power. If you’re Chuck Schumer, you’ve got to call the question or you’re going to get a primary. If you’re in a purple or a red state, it’s probably good politics for you. So this is perfectly good politics for both sides.”The voting rights package, named after the late civil rights icon and former member of Congress John Lewis, would roll back dozens of state-level voting access restrictions, create nationwide minimum early voting day standards, make Election Day a federal holiday, and allow the courts and federal government to intervene if a state passes restrictions that target minority groups. Advertisement     Last year, Republicans put in place 33 laws across 19 states that make voting more restrictive. Voting rights advocates on the ground in Georgia, where several of those bills were enacted, boycotted Biden’s speech in Atlanta on Tuesday, instead calling on him to stay in DC and get the legislation passed that would curb those state measures.Several of those leaders, from groups including Black Voters Matter, the New Georgia Project, and Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said they would expect Biden to take action to push the bills along in the days after the speech so that Georgia.Seemingly in response to that criticism, in an email to those leaders on Wednesday, the White House said the president would attend the caucus meeting on Thursday “to continue to make the case for voting rights as the party considers a vote on election reform and voting legislation” before thanking them for their “work and advocacy on this issue.”On Thursday, two of the Georgia voting rights leaders who boycotted the president’s Tuesday speech said they still want to see a vote by Monday even if the bills don’t have a chance of passing right now.“Our expectation is that every senator is put on record as to where they stand,” said James Woodall, former president of the Georgia NAACP. “We have no luxury of, or privilege of, delaying this any longer. And so we fully expect leader Schumer to be consistent in his word in holding this vote sooner rather than later.”Nsé Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project, said she expects Biden to work on Sinema and Manchin to make headway.“He needs to find out what Manchin and Sinema want,"" Ufot said. ""I’m not in a position to figure that out, but he can, so I think that feels like a next step.""Ufot and Woodall said they will continue to put pressure on the White House to make these reforms a priority.“We care deeply about this issue, because fuck these elected officials, we care about our families, we care about our communities, and that doesn't go away,” Ufot said.“We're not going anywhere. And we're never going to shut up about this.”

108,"Having survived the worst of 2000s tabloid culture, from criticisms of her partying to speculation about plastic surgery, Tara Reid wants everyone to just move on.","


As soon as we met, Tara Reid said she had brought me something. She pulled a small orange satchel from her pocket and handed it to me. “I made it myself. I picked every bead,” she said. Inside was a friendship bracelet made with turquoise, silver, and little rivets etched with words like “Beautiful” and “Believe.” She advised me to put it under moonlight to charge the crystals with good energy. Reid, like a lot of women who spent their entire adult lives living and working in Hollywood, is a little witchy, a little woo-woo, not that there’s anything wrong with that.We spoke over the course of a few days in Los Angeles, while the now-46-year-old actor was shooting a lookbook for her new sunglasses line, Cult Queen, and a handbag made in collaboration with designer Michael Kuluva. Before the shoot, she was reserved, almost sleepy, but when the photographer lifted the camera to her sightline, she popped out her leg, offered a smile, and for hours, turned on the charm that made her successful in the first place.This is the kind of behavior one might expect from an actor whose early breakout roles cemented her as an approachable bombshell and America’s Next Sweetheart. In 1998 she played Bunny Lebowski, a former porn star trophy wife who shops constantly, in the cult classic The Big Lebowski. In 1999, she was Vicky in the megahit teen comedy American Pie (and a few sequels), the quintessential girl next door who’s unsure if she really wants to have sex for the first time with her idiot boyfriend. Advertisement  But my favorite — and Reid’s — was her role in 2001’s Josie and the Pussycats. I always loved Melody, the band’s dim but sweet drummer. In the Archie Comics that inspired the film, she’s sidelined to punchlines where she isn’t even in on the joke — everyone thought Melody was an idiot, and they treated her as such, but she was actually just a perennial optimist. And Reid was the perfect vessel for such a character. “Everyone thought she was clueless, but she was actually really smart,” Reid told me.Josie and the Pussycats might have looked and smelled like a typical coming-of-age movie, but it was actually an incisive, brutal commentary on toxic media culture and how easy it is to lose yourself in the fame machine. Who better understands that cycle than Reid? “No matter what I do, even if I stopped acting tomorrow, I’m going to be famous for the rest of my life,” she said. “It wasn’t like I cared about being famous. It just all kind of happened.”At the dawn of the 2000s, Tara Reid was the quintessential It girl: a bankable, beautiful, blonde actor with sparkling blue eyes, perfect for rom-coms and gross-out comedies. But just a couple of years later, the shine had already started to wear off. There were fewer starring roles, in similar horny-slapstick movies (2002’s college comedy Van Wilder, 2003’s hijinks-heavy rom-com My Boss’s Daughter). When even those disappeared, she showed up on reality shows like Hell’s Kitchen and Celebrity Big Brother.
 


Like so many Hollywood women of the era — Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears — Reid’s career and reputation suffered in her early 20s when she hit the party circuit and became known for tabloid photos of her outside Hollywood clubs wearing low-rise jeans and chainmail halter tops. But there are big differences between Reid and her contemporaries: Namely, she never really found herself embroiled in any major scandal. “Yeah, I partied and had fun,” she told me. “We’d pop bottles of champagne. But who doesn’t?”There is no Tara Reid mugshot, no Tara Reid DUI, no Tara Reid prison sentence. “They all were in jail, they all did fucking sex tapes, crazy shit,” Reid said, referring to some of her peers. She said she never got in trouble on movie sets and was always on time. (The only story about her being late to a set is from 2018, when she was removed from a flight for causing a “disturbance,” making her three hours late to filming 5th Borough.) “There’s nothing like that about me,” she said. But it didn’t really matter — soon, perception became reality.If you ask Reid, her reputation as a party girl coincided with her reputation as a professional flake, two things she considers patently false. Elevated publications largely ignored her — she might’ve been on the cover of Maxim and Playboy and FHM, but that attention never really transferred to more roles or more respectability. Soon, her body was endlessly dissected by gossip magazines, with zoomed-in photos of her legs and abs picked apart by bloggers and readers alike.
 


Anyone who’s had their body criticized by a cruel audience, even an audience of just one, can empathize. But Reid hasn’t had her large-scale redemption narrative even as the media has reconsidered narratives about many young white women who were famous in the aughts. Maybe that’s because her story isn’t tragic in the extreme: She’s alive, well, and still working. Monica Lewinsky had her name splashed across every major newspaper in the world, while Spears had to fight for control of even the smallest part of her own life. In comparison, what did Reid endure, apart from the vagaries of fame? The world moved on; maybe she just didn’t suffer enough. Still, the way the media treated women like Reid serves as a kind of allegory for the sexist, targeted, and unjustified ways women have historically been treated.Reid isn’t bitter, but she’d have a right to be. In her 20s, she was primed to be the next big thing, but instead the roles dried up. She tolerated more cruelty than any one person should. Yet, having survived the worst of 2000s tabloid culture, Reid barely wants so much as an apology. “I don’t want people to feel sorry for me,” she said. “I don’t want people to think I’m hung up on that.”As far as she’s concerned, she doesn’t actually require redemption, whether for her sense of self-worth or her career. The way the tabloids talked about her is old news. She hasn’t made any attempt to publicly rewrite her own narrative. She isn’t writing a memoir or trying to sit down with Oprah. She’s simply been working, now producing more than acting, and living a quieter life.But hasn’t she earned an apology? Because, for all the vitriol directed at her, when it comes down to it, Reid only did two things: publicly enjoyed her 20s and altered her body in a way people didn’t approve of. Neither would have ruined her life had the public not reacted so strongly. Her peers are getting absolution. So why can’t she get a break?
 


The current revival of early-aughts fashion — Von Dutch hats and denim skirts like the ones she used to wear to Hyde Lounge — brings back a more personal element of Reid’s troubles with the tabloids. “When I see things people wear sometimes, it reminds me of my mother,” she said. “It’s a very melancholy feeling. She was great. She was a boss.”Reid’s mother died four years ago, and her father around two years before that, but she was always close to them, even after moving from her native New Jersey to Hollywood in the late ‘90s, when she was 20. The media response to her personal life hit them the hardest. “My mom would say it wasn’t fair. She said, ‘I’m going to call these motherfuckers, tell them off,’” Reid said. “She was more angry than I was. She didn’t want to be judged by her friends, by me looking bad. If I could have fixed it, I would have, but it wasn’t up to me at the time.”If she had become famous now, Reid’s partygoing might look like run-of-the-mill celebrity carousing. But in the aughts, it made her a tabloid fixture. Every night out, every relationship, and every change to her body was examined and derided ad nauseam. She was a TMZ and Perez Hilton mainstay — TMZ called her “Franken-nipple” and a “train wreck,” and ran videos making fun of her for being denied entry to clubs, while Perez Hilton covered a clothing line she was working on in a post called “Hookers Rejoice!” It was the era of Britney Spears being photographed without underwear on and Paris Hilton’s sex tape. If gossip blogs needed someone to shit on that afternoon, famous young women were perfect targets.Celebrity bloggers were quick to post close-ups of every trail of cellulite on Reid’s body, every fold on her midsection. Page Six routinely zeroed in on photos of her chest, her stomach, her butt, criticizing every fold and crease. In 2004, she went pre–social media viral when the top of her dress slipped and exposed her breast while she was at a party hosted by P. Diddy. “Tara Reid: Holy Lopsided Boobs!” proclaimed Just Jared in 2007, about red-carpet photos of the starlet smiling placidly in a green dress. In 2008, she received negative attention for paparazzi shots of her in a bikini at the beach, which showed scars left over from a fumbled liposuction procedure. (The scars aren’t that extreme, but the response was so aggressive and swift, you would’ve thought she’d had a head transplant.) “It’s a ghastly, protruding thing, isn’t it?” Lainey Lui wrote on Lainey Gossip in 2011 about Reid’s midsection. “Like it might detach from her and start killing things. Part leather, part plastic, all gross.” Advertisement  
 


Too thin and she was accused of having anorexia, but even rumors of surgical adjustments earned sneering, as if trying to evade mockery was equally worthy of derision. And the more insulting headlines she had to tolerate, the fewer roles she felt like she was being offered. She’s still trying to sort through the consequences. “Why would that affect me so much, especially when there’s never ever been an article about me being unprofessional?”Meanwhile, she was certainly making money for a lot of other people. “When I hosted [TMZ], Harvey [Levin] came up to me and goes, ‘We wouldn’t even have TMZ if it wasn’t for you. You were always the one that was picked on. For us, it was perfect,’” she said. “It wasn’t for me.” (Levin did not respond to requests for comment.) Bloggers like Perez built their own empires on such cruelty. “I found out we had the same publicist, and I [said to the publicist], ‘You’re not protecting me. Everything I tell you, are you telling him?’” she said. “I think he’s the one that ruined my career, to be honest with you.” Advertisement  In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Perez said he didn’t think they ever shared the same publicist, and he denied ever receiving tips about Reid from former or current publicists. But he still couldn’t help himself. “I’m sorry for my past coverage of Tara Reid,” he said. “I could have covered her then-sloppiness and problematic behavior with more empathy.”There are a lot of things Reid doesn’t want to talk about, but the biggest one is speculation about cosmetic surgery. (Before the interview, her publicist asked that I not ask any specific questions about what cosmetic work she has or hasn’t had done, though she was willing to discuss the impact of the tabloid coverage of her body.)In the early aughts, she reportedly received two cosmetic procedures that drastically changed her body in ways she now says she didn’t want. Her breast implants were bigger than what she originally wanted (she said she asked for B cups but received C's instead), and body contouring left her with a midsection she once called “the most ripply, bulgy thing.” She seems protective of herself and her choices, which makes sense considering how often she’s had to defend how she looks. “It was a terrible experience and everyone kept throwing it in my face,” she said. “Like, why are you being so mean?”She figured her options were to either fade away entirely, or to try a new type of public life. While the tabloids were picking her apart, Reid turned to reality TV, the dominion of stars whose A-list status has evaporated. There was the 2005 E! docuseries Taradise, where Reid tried out local cuisine and nightlife in places like Greece, Italy, and Monaco. Reid liked making it but recognizes it probably affirmed the misconceptions about her. Advertisement  
 


“That’s where, really, I think the party girl image came,” she said. “I didn’t realize that would actually hurt me. I thought it would be fun.” There was a 2011 stint on Celebrity Big Brother in the UK, alongside Irish celebrity twins Jedward and David Hasselhoff’s ex-wife, Pamela. Then, in 2016, she appeared on Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars with her “boyfriend” Dean May. She was kicked off the show on the finale when it was revealed that they weren’t a real couple. (Reid declined to discuss the scandal in our interview.)In 2008, she spent two weeks at the Promises Treatment Center, and to outsiders, it seemed like Reid was there to get sober. She said that wasn’t the truth either. “I was dating a guy at the time, he was very destructive. I couldn’t get away from him,” she said. The relationship was so abusive, she said, that her team sent her to rehab to break them up. “The only way was to go to treatment. Everyone thought I had a real problem, and that was the problem.”Reid never wavers in her eye contact when she talks; there’s no insincerity in her delivery. “No one knows the real truth about all the things that happened. This doesn’t even bother me, because I know my truth, but it used to.” Reid talks low and slow, forcing you to lean in to hear her clearly. “How long can you be angry about something?”
 


People who know Reid well paint a vastly different portrait of her than the tabloids did. Twenty years after Josie and the Pussycats, Reid still considers costar Rachael Leigh Cook one of her good friends. Cook was supposed to be a bridesmaid at Reid’s wedding to Carson Daly before it was called off in 2001 — a breakup that tabloids and Daly attributed to Reid’s partying. “To some extent, I dodged a bullet,” Daly told Elle in 2012 in an article titled “I’m Living Proof That the Good Guys Win.” “I was getting serious about my career, and she wanted to shoot movies and just party in her time off.” (Reid didn’t have as much to say about Daly: “We grew apart,” she told me. “We love each other, we care about each other, but I know I can’t spend my whole life with you. In some ways, that’s the hardest breakup in the world.”)“I think Tara’s someone who, as strong and as outspoken as she can be when she needs to be, she doesn’t actually like to look backwards,” Cook told me over the phone. “She’s always somebody who’s kept appropriate blinders going forward toward her own best, most positive path and trajectory.”Cook said that she didn’t hang out with the same “fast crowd” that Reid did, and maybe that insulated her from some of the criticisms her friend had to deal with. But the negative attention struck her as unfair. “I don’t know how she ended up as deeply mistreated as she was,” Cook said. “People would say, ‘Oh, she can’t be the sweet innocent person, not if we saw pictures of her coming out of a club in a crop top.’ That’s absurd.”The aughts starlets who survived cruel press vortexes have done it, in part, by seeking to change their public narrative with domesticity. Hilton is a newlywed, Spears and Lohan are both engaged, and Richie has two kids and a decadelong marriage to Joel Madden. Reid never followed suit, though she does have two dogs (Bella and Beso) and a live-in boyfriend of four years. But she didn’t pursue family life in as public a fashion as, say, Hilton, who recently starred in a reality show on Peacock about her wedding. “I think what they really wanted from me to make the next change was to get married and have kids. Now, she’s a woman,” Reid said. “They wanted to see me have a family, and because I didn’t, it was still fair game.” Advertisement  
 


Not that she hasn’t been offered opportunities to retell her story, like Hilton did in 2020’s This Is Paris (where she discussed her trauma after being abused at a boarding school) or Lohan’s 2014 OWN series (which followed her path toward sobriety and attempted career relaunch). “I’ve been offered a million times to do a memoir or a book,” she said. “The reason why I haven’t done it [is] because I’m not over yet. Why now? As Justin Timberlake would say, I don’t need you to cry me a river.”But doesn’t she want some kind of reckoning? I would, if someone had publicly called me “ghetto tits.” Her insistence that she doesn’t feels almost like a reverse defense mechanism: She’s so used to people mocking her that she doesn’t want to ask for too much. To ask for an apology is to take a risk; it’s too intimate and vulnerable a request from people who might still just call her ugly. Advertisement  
 


These days, bloggers like Lainey Gossip and Perez are offering up mea culpas, and it’s no longer socially acceptable to malign a young woman for going out. “Other stars get a little bit crazy now. Jennifer Lawrence fell down the stairs!” Reid said, referring to that Oscars moment in 2013. “She’s doing late-night talk shows, drinking a beer. If I ever did that, I’d be destroyed.” Still, Lawrence recently gave an interview about how she had to disappear from public life because people were getting sick of her and her relatable antics. The culture hasn’t changed that much — if tabloids want to drag a woman, they’ll find a way no matter what.Reid’s story is a case study for what happens when the stardom you’re poised for goes sideways. Now, her relationship with Hollywood and the public is an uneasy one — and no one knows, not even her, what it’ll look like in the future. Advertisement  In fact, a few months after I interviewed Reid, she was once again harangued after posting a photo of herself in a bikini. The comments came in swiftly, thousands of people assessing whether she might have an eating disorder and criticizing whatever she’s done to her body over the years. (Reid has repeatedly denied ever having any type of eating disorder.) “You need help,” one follower said. “Age isn’t everyone’s friend,” another said. Later that day, Reid posted another photo of herself, along with a statement. “Here is another picture from yesterday to show you I am not too skinny. I have a high metabolism. All I do is eat,” she said. “To everyone who wrote something nice and stuck up for me, I love you! And keep spreading that love, it is the only thing that will save this world.”Reid feels like her 20s still color people’s opinions. “Even to this day, there’s still kind of a thing about me,” Reid said. “Come on, guys. You can’t judge me by my high school picture. I’m 45 years old now.” The hope, maybe, is that people get bored of shitting on her. “Eventually it’s going to go away, and it is going away,” she said. “What are they gonna do? Pick on me when I’m 60? I’m a 90-year-old lady and I have a glass in my hand? Fuck off.”
 


If you’ve seen Reid in a movie in the last few years, it was likely one from the Sharknado franchise, the TV movie absurdities about tornados full of sharks. Reid isn’t divorced from how people perceive her, nor does she have highfalutin ideas about her career. When I asked which of her movies were her least favorite, she didn’t stutter: “Some of the stupid movies I do,” she said. “You know. It’s a paycheck.”Before filming the first Sharknado, Reid was living in London, trying to recover from a decade and a half of ruthless media attention. The city was the last spot on the American Pie Reunion promotional tour in 2012, and instead of going home, she stayed. Nothing was tying her to Hollywood anymore — her last big movie, My Boss’s Daughter (a critical bomb), premiered all the way back in 2003, and her seasonlong stint on Scrubs ended in 2005. “I need[ed] to refocus and find myself, my core again. And it worked, I went there and I lived my life,” she said. It was easier — the tabloids let up, and she felt like she could blend in and do whatever she wanted without constant observation.“My agent called me, like, ‘All right, Tara, you’re not working, we’re not doing anything, you need to work again. You need to come home,’” she said. “So then they gave me this craziest, stupidest script I’ve ever read in my whole entire life called Sharknado.”Reid credits it with reviving her career. “It’s the worst movie of all time. It’s so bad that it’s actually kind of good,” she said. “Let’s have a baby in the shark in outer space. It’s so out there. For Sharknado to bring me back is something I never would’ve expected.” Sharknado wasn’t a critical or commercial darling by any means. But the movie was a success all the same: When it premiered in 2013 on Syfy, it had 1.4 million viewers, on a channel with a typical viewership of less than a million. Its third screening a few weeks later got 2.1 million viewers. (Sharknado 2: The Second One, got 3.9 million viewers on a Wednesday night.) With its aggressive commitment to campy terror, Sharknado is now a cult classic that inspires midnight screenings and themed parties. Advertisement     In 2018, The Last Sharknado: It’s About Time came out, marking the end of the franchise. But the Sharknado movies exposed her to a new audience, as evidenced by a recent flight she took from a vacation in Mexico back home to LA. “The flight attendant comes up to me and he goes, ‘Oh my god, I so loved your movie.’ So of course, I automatically think [of] American Pie,” she said. “And he goes, ‘Sharknado is everything.’ I was like, Is this really happening?”
 


Her next project is the forthcoming Masha’s Mushroom, a thriller about an overworked mother who throws a party for her daughter where all the guests end up dosed with a hallucinogen. Reid plays the mother; Vivica A. Fox and Beverly D’Angelo also star. Reid is also a producer on the movie. Even though she decided to get involved in producing because roles for women her age are famously hard to find, she’s excited about it. “If someone’s not gonna give me that chance, then I was like, I gotta make it for myself,” she said. “I found a great script, great director. I’m so proud of what we’ve accomplished.” Finally, she’s on the other side of the Hollywood equation. “It was so funny this time, calling up the agents that said no to me that I’d like to make an offer to your client,” she said. “To reach out to all these different companies and me being the boss this time, it was like, the table’s turned. It was beyond satisfying.” Advertisement     It’s easy to root for Reid when she tells stories like this. She comes off as open and sweet; she ended our interview by proclaiming “I love you!” into my recorder. And while Reid told me, over and over, that she didn’t want or need a reconsideration, I still want one for her. Whether she’s saying it because it’s true or just a line for a culture that has largely scorned her, she does seem exhausted from explaining herself. She’s tried repeatedly to make it clear that she’s productive, settled, kind, and easygoing. It hasn’t worked so far. Appearing in a well-known movie franchise hasn’t proved it. Refusing to engage in criticism of her body hasn’t either. Wanting to be understood has only led to disappointment, so why not forget about it? Vindication isn’t everything. What could anyone do to make amends? Cry her a river, and then what?Reid has little time for regrets. “I wonder what else I would’ve done,” she said. “Do I take it back? No, I don’t. It’s who I am.”●

For years, Facebook moderators employed by third-party contractors have sought to expose poor working conditions, and their dissent grew louder during the pandemic as many were forced to return to the office with little to no safety net. But Spanish-language moderators say they face even worse treatment than their English-focused colleagues.
 


At the Richardson, Texas, office of Genpact, a Meta subcontractor, Spanish-language moderators told BuzzFeed News they’ve been required to report to the office since April 2021, despite the emergence of both Delta and Omicron variants that caused COVID infections to spike across the US. Throughout this time, they said, moderators reviewing English-language content have been allowed to cycle through the office in three-month rotations.“Being in the office … has been nothing short of a nightmare,” one moderator said.BuzzFeed News spoke to three members of Genpact’s so-called Mexican market team who described a pattern of inequitable treatment of Spanish-language moderators. All of these individuals spoke on the condition of anonymity as Genpact requires them to sign nondisclosure agreements and they feared for their jobs. They said that in addition to reporting to the office for the last nine months while their English-language counterparts could work from home, Spanish-language moderators are held to unrealistic performance standards and are not compensated for working in two languages, which they say is more time-consuming. In addition, they face the pressures of managing a Facebook market that has long been criticized as under-moderated amid the threat of active COVID cases.Genpact spokesperson Danielle D’Angelo declined to comment on all of the specific claims made by Spanish-language moderators, including the claim that its Mexican market team was not allowed to work from home while other teams were rotated out.“We would like to stress that employee safety is our top priority and that has and will remain so throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,” D’Angelo said. “Any return to office decisions that are made in alignment with client needs are done with best safety and health practices in place and in accordance with local regulations. In all of our workplace locations, including our Richardson, TX office, we follow best-in-class safety standards, which includes frequent antigen testing.”On Thursday, managers at Genpact’s Richardson site reportedly told company agents that it has scrapped plans to reopen at 50% capacity on Jan. 31 due to the Omicron variant. Spanish-language moderators said this change does not affect them, and they will continue reporting to the office. Genpact declined to comment on when it intends to reopen, and at what capacity.In late June, Genpact leadership sent an email to one of the English-language moderation groups allowed to rotate out of the office, thanking them for their ""continued dedication and responsiveness."" The email said they would return to working from home on July 26.Spanish-language moderators told BuzzFeed News they received no such email. Days after English-language moderators were told they could go back home, “[managers] told us we were a specialized queue, and that our job could not be done outside of the office,” one moderator said, noting that the Mexican market often involves moderating a deluge of particularly graphic content. Facebook declined to comment on the complaints of its Spanish-language moderators, referring BuzzFeed News to Genpact — a strategy it has taken time and again when addressing the concerns of people who make their living moderating Facebook content.Since returning to the Richardson office, employees have grown increasingly fearful for their safety. Moderators told BuzzFeed News that 30 COVID cases were reported to staff by management in December, and that no updates have been communicated since then. Meanwhile, workers say their colleagues continue to test positive for COVID, citing two cases on one floor last week. Genpact declined to comment on the number of COVID cases in its office or how frequently it reports these cases to staff.On Dec. 22, a dozen Spanish-language moderators left the office en masse after learning through the grapevine that a sick colleague may have exposed them to the virus. Since workers claim that Genpact does not currently offer its moderators paid sick leave, they used PTO to self-isolate. Genpact declined to comment on whether its moderators are provided paid sick leave.Despite being named for the Mexican market, this team reviews Facebook and Instagram content posted in Spanish by users across most of Latin America as well, moderators said. As of 2018, there were 84 million Facebook users in Mexico, and tens of millions more using WhatsApp. In Latino and Spanish-speaking communities, Facebook has been a powerful vector of misinformation, shaping the public’s perception of topics such as COVID, election politics, and Black Lives Matter. But researchers studying misinformation told the Guardian that compared to English-language posts, harmful content posted in Spanish is removed less frequently.
 


Members told BuzzFeed News that Genpact began building this team in early 2020, initially sourcing volunteers from other existing departments.“Genpact made everyone who has a remotely Hispanic-sounding name take a Spanish test, and if they failed they were asked to take it again,” one moderator told BuzzFeed News on the condition of anonymity, fearing they could face retaliation for speaking publicly about internal company matters.Employees claim that moderators not fluent in Spanish were forced into the role as a result and that many failed to meet performance expectations and were subsequently fired. Currently, the Mexican market team consists of roughly 50 people.But even workers fluent in Spanish feel beaten down by what they characterized as unreasonable standards. For example, moderators are expected to maintain an 85% accuracy rate while sticking to a 66-second “handle time,” or time frame for making decisions on pieces of content. While these thresholds might be sensible for one language, navigating dual languages can take more time. Moderators say they have to translate Facebook guidelines, which are only disseminated in English, into Spanish before applying them. A large number of posts by users in Mexico and across Latin America also contain English, they added, forcing them to switch between languages regularly. Genpact declined to comment on how Spanish-language moderators are evaluated and paid. Facebook did not respond to a query about the language in which its guidelines are provided.The pandemic has caused Facebook moderators at several outsourcing firms to organize around issues such as paid sick leave, hazard pay, and the class system dividing contract workers from salaried tech employees. Last week, Accenture suddenly allowed its Facebook moderators to work from home after originally ordering them back to the office, following a BuzzFeed News inquiry.Though Facebook has never publicly revealed how many users it has throughout Latin America, its platform and apps function as vital utilities for citizens of many of these countries. That pressure is felt by Genpact’s Spanish-language moderators, who said that despite the outsize importance of their jobs, they’re the smallest team in the office.Facebook spokesperson Kadia Koroma said the company uses a “combination of technology and people to keep content that breaks our rules off of our platform, and while AI has made progress in this space, people are a key part of our safety efforts.” The company said that Spanish is one of the most common languages used on Facebook and that Spanish-language reviews are conducted 24 hours per day at several sites across the world.Moderators who returned to the office in April assumed it was due to Mexico’s midterm elections, which were held in June. “We figured, OK, let the election pass,” one moderator said. Throughout 2021, English-language moderators had been rotating in and out. The Mexican market team figured it would be the same for them.“Then a week before we were supposed to be rotated out, we got an email saying, ‘Thank you for the hard work, but unfortunately the Mexican market is going to stay in place,’” they added. Facebook declined to comment on how it interacts with subcontractors managing specific moderation markets.“We know these jobs can be difficult, which is why we work closely with our partners to constantly evaluate how to best support these teams,” Koroma said.

111,"Officers across the US, under fire as videos posted to social media hold them accountable, are creating slickly produced YouTube vlogs to boost morale, public support, and aid in recruitment.","


KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI — “Stop the car!” a police officer yells in the video, pulling out his gun as a silver Audi minivan kicks it into reverse, swerving away from him. The officer runs after the car.“Get out, get out, get out,” the officer says, his words blending together. He aims his gun with one hand at the Black man driving and holds his radio with the other.A fast-moving situation. An officer with a drawn weapon. A Black man suspected of a crime. Bystanders screaming at the police that the man behind the wheel has a mental condition. And a video broadcast on social media. Time and time again the world has seen these videos end in tragedy. Advertisement  But no one is shot in this video. At the tensest moment, a soundtrack amps up music that would fit in a Fast & Furious trailer. Without incident, the officer gets the driver out of the car and takes him to a hospital for mental health treatment.This video, which was uploaded in July 2020 and has more than 87,000 views, is one of hundreds the Miami Police Department has put out since it started vlogging in 2015 (the most popular has 3.4 million views). Miami is just an early adopter of a renewed tactic. Now, police departments across the nation are producing slick videos, pushing a “good cop” image after years of outrage over shootings, many captured on video and published to social media, and the resulting protests demanding accountability. The New York Police Department has posted over 800 videos to its channel, including web series called Beyond the Badge and Neighborhood Policing. The Los Angeles Police Department regularly posts bodycam and security footage, sometimes cutting it together with a moving score, like this video of an officer providing first aid to a man injured during riots after an LA Lakers championship game.The videos continue the tradition, popularized by shows like Cops and Live PD, of glorifying police work via highly edited, suspenseful, “documentary”-style entertainment. But these are coming from the departments themselves, with police employees editing and uploading the clips right to YouTube. A new form of “copaganda,” as activists refer to it. There has been a boom in these shows and channels over the past 19 months, after both Cops and Live PD — criticized for years for glorifying police work and perpetuating racial stereotypes — were canceled amid the summer 2020 protests. (Cops is now making a return on Fox Nation.)Current and former spokespeople for five different police departments said these videos help with “public education,” “community outreach,” recruiting, and morale. Advertisement  But most critically some officials say they are made to counteract the dominant online presence of the police accountability and reform movements of the past eight years.When video of George Floyd being choked to death started circulating around the world, “every police department that was watching that in the country went. Oh, F.U.C.K. is this going to hit us?” said Lauri Stevens, the founder of SMILE, an annual conference, awards, and training outfit for law enforcement social media use.“And it did, and they knew it. They knew it from the minute it happened, it’s going to come down on us.”The reaction among departments was an age-old tactic strengthened by new technology: Drive the narrative you want to get out. Advertisement  Still, some of the officers who make the videos are reckoning with their involvement in them. Take Officer Malcolm Whitelaw of the Kansas City Police Department, who was at the vanguard of his department’s video strategy. He’s also grappling with being the public face of the very system that’s caused him fear in the past.
 


I followed Whitelaw for a few days this summer as he made and edited a video about applying to become a police officer. The goal was to boost recruitment. Advertisement  We walked around police communications and media headquarters in Kansas City, the department recruitment office, and the police academy as he filmed in selfie mode, explaining how to apply and what someone should expect if they are accepted into the academy.“People tell me my videos look like Live PD, but I don’t really think so,” Whitelaw said when the camera stopped rolling. “I’m still kind of figuring out my style.”Whitelaw, who is Black, is a 29-year-old former marketing student who has been on the force for six years. He’s hulking and friendly, with a squinty smile.Whitelaw loves working as a police officer, but, he told me repeatedly, he doesn’t consider it his identity the way he believes many of his colleagues do. It’s just a job, he said. At the end of the day, the badge comes off. Then he’s just Malcolm. Advertisement  He was a patrol officer before he started making videos for the department at the beginning of 2021. The videos were his idea, inspired in part, though maybe subconsciously, he conceded, by his experience patrolling last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests.“As I was standing there, there were some girls, like, yelling at me, and I kind of got confused because this is a young white girl telling me that I don’t understand what it means to be Black,” Whitelaw said, sitting at a conference table with his two white bosses, who were nodding along. “And I’m like, I have more experience in this field than you.”Later, during a break from shooting a video in the recruitment office, away from his colleagues, we discussed the issue further.“I’m a police officer, and I’m also Black. No confusion there. And so my experience as a police officer is very different sometimes than those that don’t share my skin complexion. Because, well, where do we police? Right? We police in areas with people that look like me,” Whitelaw said, his voice lowering an octave. Advertisement  For Whitelaw, and for the Black protesters he was patrolling, dealing with police hostility and brutality had been a reality their whole lives.When Whitelaw was a sophomore in high school, living just outside of Kansas City, he said, he was walking home from school when suddenly an officer pulled up and, gun out, stopped him. Whitelaw didn’t know what was happening and the officer didn’t explain, he said, but kept telling him to stay where he was. Soon, several more cops pulled up around him. They held him there until they figured out he wasn’t the guy they were looking for.“I matched the description,” Whitelaw added. He was scared, and his mother was furious.“Growing up, I didn’t like the police, I wouldn’t talk to the police,” Whitelaw said. “My head was hardwired like that. That was a huge hurdle to get over because I had all the same thoughts as the people that don’t like the police. You know, I had started working for a department” — he later clarified his encounter with police was with a nearby department — “that pulled me over at gunpoint.” Advertisement  Whitelaw said he regularly encounters people who still think that way, who see him as a traitor for being a Black police officer. Because of that, he said, he finds himself having to “exist in that place as a human being, not so much getting caught up in my skin color.”“There’s people who look at me and they hate me that much more because I’m Black. ‘How dare you?’ You know, like, ‘How dare you be a police, you know what they’ve done to us.’ That’s what people are thinking,” Whitelaw said.“It’s sometimes so disheartening because it’s like, I’m the best person to have right here, you know. Because I’m not looking at you because of who you — because of this situation,” he stumbled over his words. “I’m looking beyond that. We can handle our business, and I’m gonna treat you as a person you want to talk to with respect.”He hopes to bring some of this understanding into his videos. Whitelaw has been obsessed with YouTube since he was a teen, fantasizing about creating his own videos and becoming a sensation on the platform. After watching Miami’s police vlogs religiously, he decided that his department should do something similar. Advertisement  The chief approved it, and Whitelaw’s been on special assignment in the media unit since the beginning of 2021. When I was with him in August, he said that so far the office had given him almost free rein. He taught himself video editing and about equipment online and invested a significant chunk of his own money (though he wouldn’t say how much) in cameras and lenses. The department put out its first vlog in March.
 


After the first couple of YouTube videos, the KCPD YouTube channel had a 1,000% increase in viewership — this is according to Whitelaw — and saw 1,400 new subscribers in the first few weeks. Things have steadied since then. As of mid-January, the KCPD had published its ninth video and had nearly 7,000 subscribers. Whitelaw also recently launched a KCPD TikTok page, hoping to reach a younger, wider audience. Advertisement  Right after the channel launched, he started getting inundated with requests from officers in other departments to be featured on the videos. Pro-police commenters leave positive feedback and aspiring officers use the forum to ask Whitelaw questions in the comments about how to become a cop. He has even started getting recognized in public, he said.Whitelaw’s hope for these videos is that they show the benefits of community policing, not just to the public but to current and future officers. Officers, with burnout, social pressures, and a high-intensity work environment, sometimes need a reminder of why they got into the force, Whitelaw said.“As police officers, a lot of times we have to be so rigid, right?” Whitelaw said. “We’re dealing with, you know, traumatic events, and sometimes when you’re out there, you kind of forget to be a person. So that’s what I try to get people to feel and remind them: You are a person.”He added that it doesn’t hurt that the videos help boost morale, by making officers feel badass, “seeing themselves with cool music and, you know, different shooting angles, and seeing how much fun people are having.” Advertisement  
 


While I was with the KCPD, Whitelaw made a video about the testing process for applicants to get into the police academy. It came after the chief requested that the KCPD up its recruiting game.The plan was to follow the latest group of applicants as they took the exams. Whitelaw gave his followers a tour of the academy’s training facilities. He walked backward along an indoor running track, filming in selfie mode and breathing hard as he talked through his KCPD-branded mask. Advertisement     “Us police officers, we try to de-escalate using the best de-escalation tactics, which you will learn at the police academy,” Whitelaw said, walking up to a punching bag. “But, you know, life is very unpredictable.” He lightly punched it three times, then walked over to a life-size, silver, rubber figure with red shapes marking its chest, stomach, crotch, and knees. This dummy, named “Numb John,” is for baton training, he explained.Next, we walked downstairs, past large cardboard printouts of a white, bald man with a goatee in a fighting position. He was covered in hundreds of tiny holes on his back, stomach, and crotch (stun gun practice, Whitelaw remarked). Then we entered the hand-to-hand combat training room. The room looked like a karate dōjō. On one wall hung a “thin blue line” American flag, and on another hung two black-and-white pictures of officers putting people in, apparently, chokeholds. Between them was a banner reading “‘Come to the Party People’ - Jim Lindell.”
 


(Lindell invented a controversial alternative to chokeholds, which the KCPD has argued is less dangerous despite repeated calls from local organizers to ban the use of the restraint, though the department has refused.)We entered the exam room. Most of the 22 people applying to join the police academy had already taken their seats. The majority were white and male.The officers allowed me to take a quick poll of the applicants. I asked if anyone had watched Whitelaw’s videos for the KCPD, and four people raised their hands. I asked if anyone regularly watched YouTube videos from other police departments or about policing, and eight of the applicants raised their hands — all men, mostly white.“I spend a lot of time on YouTube watching videos about what it’s like” to be a police officer, Jay Humfeld, 42, told me. He’d been thinking about becoming a cop for a while, but watching Whitelaw’s videos — as well as Live PD and other police content fed to him by YouTube and Facebook’s algorithms — helped push him to actually apply. Advertisement     Once YouTube’s algorithm learns you’re interested in this genre, it’ll take you from officers in Houston using a heat-tech drone to find a fugitive hiding in a sewer system to a montage of police dogs in the Kansas City K-9 unit opening car doors with their snouts to a trans officer in Seattle standing in front of a skyline and telling her story. They’re largely a behind-the-scenes look at the job — the action, glamor, humor, and camaraderie. But they all share a message: We are the good cops.Two of the other applicants, a 28-year-old named Juan and a 22-year-old who asked me not to use his name, both of whom have military backgrounds, said they’d also watched Live PD and Cops, as well as videos from the KCPD and other police departments. They said YouTube fed them both kinds of videos interchangeably. The 22-year-old said he used to watch the Miami Police Department videos and thought they were “kinda cool.”“Police departments are making videos about what they do every day, and the different kinds of police officers like SWAT and vice, just everybody, it’s cool to learn about,” he said. He added that the main reason he was applying was that his uncle had just retired from the KCPD the week before.Juan estimated that he watches about 30 to 40 minutes of these videos a week unless he gets in a “scroll hole” and loses track of time. Entering the police force is a common career move for people with a military background, he said, but the videos also helped him understand what police work was really like, they made him feel like he could actually do the job. Advertisement     “That and also, I feel like there’s this negative connotation to police work, and the way people see it,” Juan added. “I just want to be the best person that I could, and help the community.”
 


In posting dozens, or hundreds, of hours of content on a regular schedule, police departments are essentially turning themselves into multimedia publishing platforms. They use Twitter to break the news, Facebook Live to give press conferences, Nextdoor to track and respond to neighborhood issues, Instagram to defuse tension with positive counterprogramming, TikTok to reach Gen Z, and long YouTube videos to provide ongoing entertainment and “education.” Advertisement     Nick Perez, a current police officer who started and starred in the hyper-popular Miami Police Department YouTube channel, told me that when his unit began the channel, they were seeing a lot of outrage over police violence online.“Back in 2015. It was a very anti-police atmosphere that was going around social media and there was no real pro-police side, nobody speaking on behalf of the police departments,” Perez said. The result, he said, was, “OK now here’s the police side, but we were doing it to reach out to our community as the Miami police department. However, we kind of took on the role of the pro-police content that was coming out.”Other police agencies caught on, he said, and suddenly, “with the idea of reaching our community, we kind of reached the world.”“The news was running stories about police whatever, what was happening with police in a negative light, but all we were doing was showing what we were doing,” Perez said later. “Which in turn made [people say], ‘let’s share their positive story.’ [There was] a lot of anti-police rhetoric, and we were the positive story coming out around that time.” Advertisement     Perez’s YouTube videos have also significantly boosted recruitment for the department, he told me, highlighting a recruitment video they recently posted that resulted, he said, in 1,000 new job applications in 12 hours.The massive protests that erupted after police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, were the catalyst for not just Black Lives Matter but for police departments to realize they needed to embrace these new methods if they wanted to be heard, Stevens, the founder of SMILE, said.“Ferguson was a huge, huge, huge event, Charlottesville was huge, Baltimore, all of them were big in the whole social media policing [uptick]. But Ferguson was a real peak in police social media,” said Stevens.“The Ferguson Police Department were doing zero with social media when the whole ‘Hands Up, Don’t Shoot’ situation went down,” Stevens said. “Now they’re very much in support of using social media and understand that they have to use social media, because they get how social media was their undoing that day.” Advertisement     One former police officer — who asked not to be named so as not to jeopardize his new career — worked in police media outreach in a liberal city for years, but left the force in part due to the systematic problems exposed by the Black Lives Matter movement. He said that he faced a lot of debates in his department over how to use social media, particularly video platforms.“OK, so I’ve learned more about this wonderful human driving a patrol car and responding to tough calls,” he said. “But I’ve got a problem with the person who stopped me last week and was very dismissive and rude, or called my friend a racial slur, or refused to give me their name and badge number.”If there is no clear way to file a complaint about that other person or to successfully hold them accountable — which there very often is not — then showing examples of positive policing without any means of accountability is creating a false narrative, he said.“It’s a really fine line if you’re only doing one and not doing the other,” the former officer said. “Then that — that borders on propaganda.” Advertisement     Kansas City illustrates the problem. In order to file a complaint against a KCPD officer, citizens have to contact the Office of Community Complaints, “a non-police, civilian oversight agency.” However, the site makes clear, if the office deems the complaint worthy of an investigation, it hands that complaint over to the department’s Internal Affairs Unit. According to KCPD’s Office of Community Complaints, of 1,059 complaints in Kansas City between 2016 and 2019 against police officers, 246 investigations were completed, and only around 12% ruled in favor of civilians, the OCC said in a statement. The Police Scorecard, a public database tracking police accountability nationwide, found that of the 132 use-of-force complaints during that time, 0% ruled in favor of civilians. KCPD’s OCC said in a statement that “most of the force investigations either do not present enough information for the OCC to make a determination or the evidence proves conclusively that there was no violation of policy or procedure,” and added that in cases where the office does not rule in favor of the complainant, they may still take “corrective action” like training or policy reviews.The KCPD has, though, recently been held accountable in the court system. In November, an officer was found guilty of killing Cameron Lamb in his home during an erratic driving investigation. The trial was reportedly the first for a KCPD officer accused of killing someone in the line of duty since 1942.The videos also raise other questions of accountability. Robin Andersen, a professor of media studies at Fordham University who has studied media treatment of police and the military for decades, observed that the officers in these videos often deal with people with mental illnesses, sending them off to hospitals and emergency rooms instead of arresting them.Replacing police with mental health professionals has been one of the major demands of police reform activists. And since last summer’s protests, several cities around the country have attempted to oblige, rolling out pilot programs that send specialists instead of police to behavioral health calls. According to a Washington Post database of fatal shootings by police, almost a quarter of the people shot and killed by police since 2015 have mental illnesses. Advertisement     The results from the first three months of New York’s version of this program were promising, and New York expanded the program in November. More people called for and received help than they do from 911 calls, New York 1 reported, and fewer people were transported to the hospital (which often does very little for a patient and leaves them with exorbitant medical debt). In June, the KCPD started requiring all of its officers to take a 16-hour “Intro to Crisis Intervention” course (though, KCPD noted, 55% of its officers have taken the full 40-hour course), and the department has one, five-person squad called the Crisis Intervention Team. It specifically responds to mental health calls but is composed of police officers. The department does not currently have plans to replace officers with civilian mental health specialists, KCPD said.“It is so clear, the reason these videos exist is to block and attempt to affect the public’s demand for police reform,” Andersen said. “They’re saying, ‘We don’t really need this. We are really nice guys already doing really good work and helping people.’ But we know that is, in reality, not the case.”In a statement responding to Andersen’s analysis, KCPD’s public information officer, Jake Becchina, disagreed. “Our department is constantly striving to be a better version of itself. We don’t always get it right, but we try to make improvements,” Becchina wrote. “We would never say that we are perfect and reform/improvements/change (however you would like to say it) are not needed. As such providing videos to try to prove that reform isn’t needed would be counterproductive to our mission.”
 


Outside of the Kansas City Police headquarters, statues memorializing fallen officers were wrapped in cellophane since the protests. All year, people protesting police brutality had been graffitiing them with “BLM” and “No Justice No Peace,” so the city covered them up. One statue, not wrapped, was a metal sculpture of a man plugging his own ears, his shoe in his mouth, and his tie around his eyes. It sat directly in front of one of the entrances to the building. The sign next to it read “Communications.”Inside, cubicles are covered in children’s drawings, bobbleheads, plants, and family photos. An indoor putting mat stretches between the desks, leading to a conference table and a whiteboard with the words “Twitter is not real life” written above plans for the team’s social media strategy.Pro-police paraphernalia faces Whitelaw’s desk from almost every direction: a pegboard sign reading “Blue Lives Matter KCPD,” the “thin blue line” flag on a large wooden police badge, a shelf designed like the American flag holding police badges in each stripe. Whitelaw’s boss, Jake Becchina, wears a ""thin blue line"" dog tag with a prayer on the back around his neck.“I don’t have any Blue Lives Matter stuff,” he said flatly when I asked him about it when we were away from the office. “It ain’t my cup of tea. And that’s all I’m gonna say about that.” Advertisement     The day after shooting the video at the academy, Whitelaw sat in his cubicle, preparing to edit the new footage and to add captions and a soundtrack. He wanted to get it out as soon as he could, so the next academy class would have even more applicants. His colleagues were sitting at the conference table, explaining to the least online among them what an influencer was. One of them called Whitelaw an influencer, and he chuckled.
 


“What if you are, though?” I asked, sitting behind him. “We’ve had a lot of discussions about how you don’t consider this job your identity. But if these videos get more popular, and you’re kind of the face of the department, how do you feel you’re going to reconcile those things?” Advertisement     “I’ve kind of, like, feathered the idea, if that makes any sense,” he said. “Because outside of this world, I’m just me. I wouldn’t want to, you know, confuse the two. I love the department. I love the community. But like, am I going to be running around being, like, Officer Whitelaw everywhere I go?”I pointed out that he said people were already starting to recognize him on the street.“You’re asking me something that I haven’t necessarily thought about,” he said. “So your question is, what does it look like when I’m out there in the world, and I’m not just a random Black dude, even not in uniform, walking around in the streets? But now I am Officer Whitelaw from YouTube. That’s how people recognize me.”He took a deep breath and thought about it more, talking through the question aloud until he came to a conclusion. Advertisement     “If you have to be the face of something, at least it’s being the face for the right reasons, or good reasons, things that are positive,” he said, and started chuckling again.“Because there will be a face of the department some other way, so it might as well be me.” ●

112,"The court ruled that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration was empowered to ""set workplace safety standards, not broad public health measures.""","


The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked a Biden administration rule that required US companies with 100 employees or more to mandate that their staff be vaccinated against COVID-19 or submit to weekly testing.But the court also narrowly upheld a vaccine mandate for healthcare workers at facilities that receive federal funding.By blocking the mandate for private companies, which would have covered more than 84 million workers, the court dealt a significant blow to the White House's efforts to curtail the pandemic at a time when hospitalizations have surged nationwide due to the spread of the Omicron variant. Advertisement     ""I am disappointed that the Supreme Court has chosen to block common-sense life-saving requirements for employees at large businesses that were grounded squarely in both science and the law,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement.In an opinion authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, six members of the court granted a request from the National Federation of Independent Business to prevent the Occupational Safety and Health Administration from enforcing the private employer rule for now.The majority of justices said the NFIB was likely to succeed in court by arguing Biden's labor secretary lacked authority to impose the mandate.They said the law that established OSHA ""empowers the Secretary to set workplace safety standards, not broad public health measures.""""Although Congress has indisputably given OSHA the power to regulate occupational dangers, it has not given that agency the power to regulate public health more broadly,"" the court said. ""Requiring the vaccination of 84 million Americans, selected simply because they work for employers with more than 100 employees, certainly falls in the latter category.""The court's three liberal members — justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan — said in a dissenting opinion that they would have allowed the mandate to be enforced, calling COVID-19 a ""menace in work settings.""They accused their colleagues on the court — ""elected by, and accountable to, no one"" — of acting inappropriately as workplace health and safety experts.""In the face of a still-raging pandemic, this Court tells the agency charged with protecting worker safety that it may not do so in all the workplaces needed,"" the liberal justices wrote. ""As disease and death continue to mount, this Court tells the agency that it cannot respond in the most effective way possible.""But in a separate decision in which Kavanaugh and Chief Justice John Roberts joined the liberals, the court decided 5–4 that the secretary of health and human services was authorized under existing law to require facilities to ensure their staffs are vaccinated against COVID (unless exempt for religious or medical reasons) in order to receive Medicare and Medicaid funding.""After all,"" they wrote, ""ensuring that providers take steps to avoidtransmitting a dangerous virus to their patients is consistent with the fundamental principle of the medical profession: first, do no harm.""The decision will affect 10.4 million healthcare workers at some 76,000 medical facilities.Four of the court's most conservative members — justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Amy Coney Barrett — said they would not have allowed that rule to go forward.Republicans cheered the court for blocking the private sector mandate, calling it an unnecessary imposition on businesses.""President Biden’s private sector vaccine mandate was always unwarranted and overbearing,"" Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi wrote on Twitter. ""I am glad that the Supreme Court has curbed runaway executive overreach and ensured that individual liberty does not become a casualty of this pandemic."" Advertisement     But public health workers and scientists said the decision was deeply disappointing.""As a physician and public health person I find this ruling very disappointing,"" said Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. ""So many Americans have been poisoned with vaccine misinformation. Mandates work to protect them and those around them. This ruling will mean more suffering, more deaths, and more overwhelmed hospitals.""In his statement, Biden credited his vaccine mandates with reducing the number of unvaccinated Americans from 90 million to under 35 million.He called on business leaders to still institute their own vaccine requirements for employees in order to protect staff and customers.""The Court has ruled that my administration cannot use the authority granted to it by Congress to require this measure,"" Biden said, ""but that does not stop me from using my voice as President to advocate for employers to do the right thing to protect Americans’ health and economy.""Like many Americans, the Supreme Court justices worked remotely and online during a long stretch of the pandemic. All nine members have since been vaccinated and received a booster shot, according to a court spokesperson.

113,"If 2021 felt like one of the hottest years of your life, you're not wrong.","


The last seven years on Earth have been the hottest on record with no signs of slowing down, and 2021 ranked the sixth warmest ever, climate researchers at NOAA and NASA announced on Thursday.This is what climate change caused by human activity looks like, and there’s no end in sight.“We’re already seeing the impacts of the global warming that we’re talking about now in local weather and in extreme [weather events],” said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, at a press conference. “We can detect the contribution of human warming on things like the heat waves in the Pacific Northwest, the intense precipitation that accompanied Hurricane Ida, or the floods in Germany and China.” Advertisement     A similar analysis from European scientists released this week also found the last seven years were the hottest on record, although their specific rankings by year differed slightly. According to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, 2021 was the fifth warmest on record.Last year was an especially deadly and expensive year for climate and weather disasters in the US. Texas saw unmatched freezing temperatures last winter, the Pacific Northwest experienced deadly heat waves, and the South and Midwest faced massive tornadoes, among many other extreme weather events in 2021.The researchers noted that a climate pattern known as La Niña helped to slightly cool parts of the Pacific Ocean in 2021, which may continue into this year. However, the average temperatures in the last seven years have all leaped over previous decades’ records.“It’s clear that each of the past four decades have been warmer than the one that preceded it,” Russell Vose, chief of the analysis and synthesis branch of NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, told reporters. “And it’s been a steady increase in temperature since at least the 1960s.”Climate researchers expect the years ahead to follow this pattern and predict we will reach an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius in the 2030s or early 2040s. However, regardless of when the globe reaches that temperature, scientists point out that global warming data is no longer just data but is playing out in real life.The planet has already warmed more than 1 degree Celsius compared to 1880s levels. Time is quickly running out to limit warming another half degree, which is the goal of the Paris climate agreement. Frustration about the lack of action on cutting greenhouse gas emissions came to a head at November’s 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, which left many climate activists and developing countries unsatisfied with minimal progress from larger countries.“Temperatures will keep rising as long as we keep increasing greenhouse gases,” Schmidt said.That means 2022 will probably be another hot one, filled with more dangerous disasters.“We can predict with some confidence that we will see more and more extreme heat waves, more intense rainfall, and more coastal flooding,” Schmidt said. “It may not be the Pacific Northwest next year, but it will be somewhere and we will obviously have to be prepared.” Advertisement     Just this week, South America and Australia are facing blistering heat waves. Western Australia’s Onslow today hit 123.2 degrees Fahrenheit, or 50.7 degrees Celsius, matching a record-high temperature for the region set back in 1962, the BBC reported. And earlier this week, Buenos Aires reached 106 degrees (or 41.1 degrees Celsius), according to AccuWeather, making it the second-highest temperature recorded there in more than a century.“There’s probably a 99% chance that 2022 will rank in the top 10 hottest years,” Vose said.

114,The case against Rhodes and 10 co-defendants is the first sedition case brought in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol.,"


Federal prosecutors have charged Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and 10 others associated with the armed extremist group with seditious conspiracy, the first such charge to come out of the sprawling investigation of the Capitol insurrection since it began just over a year ago.Rhodes, 56, was arrested on Thursday shortly before noon local time in Little Elm, Texas, about 35 miles north of Dallas. A second man, Edward Vallejo, 63, was arrested in Phoenix, according to the Department of Justice. The other nine defendants have all previously been charged in the Oath Keepers conspiracy case pending in Washington, DC, federal court. Advertisement     According to the indictment, which was handed up by a grand jury on Wednesday and sealed until the following day, Rhodes conspired “to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power” by stopping Congress’s certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6.He and the other defendants, prosecutors claim, “coordinated travel across the country to enter Washington, DC, equipped themselves with a variety of weapons, donned combat and tactical gear, and were prepared to answer Rhodes’s call to take up arms at Rhodes’s direction.”Attorney Jonathan Moseley, who represents another member of the Oath Keepers, said he was on the phone with Rhodes when the FBI called on the other line asking the group's founder to come outside so he could be arrested. Kellye SoRelle, the Oath Keepers’ general counsel, said she is working to find a criminal defense attorney to represent Rhodes. She called the arrest “all part of the show” and said he did not have enough funds to hire representation.In the immediate aftermath of the assault on the US Capitol, the acting US attorney in Washington, DC, at the time, Michael Sherwin, announced that a task force had been formed to explore more serious charges in connection with Jan. 6, including seditious conspiracy. Advertisement     But although more than 725 people have since been charged with a variety of misdemeanors and felonies for their involvement in the events of Jan. 6, a number of whom are facing conspiracy charges related to obstructing Congress’s attempts to certify the Electoral College, none has previously been charged with crimes related to sedition — which amounts to inciting a rebellion against the government.The charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. It’s a rarely charged offense. Federal prosecutors last tried to pursue it in a 2010 indictment involving members of a militant group, and a judge ended up acquitting the defendants of the sedition count two years later.Rhodes, whose first name is Elmer but who goes by his middle name, founded the Oath Keepers in 2009. Known for the distinctive patch he wears to cover up an eye he lost from an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound, he is a former Army paratrooper and graduate of Yale Law School who was later disbarred from practicing law. He worked briefly for former member of Congress Ron Paul and rose to prominence as a frequent guest on Alex Jones’ Infowars program, as well as for leading the Oath Keepers members into a series of charged political events, including the 2014 confrontation between cattle ranchers and federal law enforcement in southern Nevada known as the Bundy standoff.Rhodes, originally from Nevada, lived for years in Montana, but since separating from his wife in 2018 has lived an itinerant life. He settled most recently in Granbury, Texas, where SoRelle, the Oath Keepers’ attorney, is based. A longtime libertarian and critic of political figures on both sides of the aisle, Rhodes became more closely aligned with former president Donald Trump in the lead-up to and wake of the 2020 election, casting doubt on the results of the election and calling on members of the Oath Keepers to attend protests and gather in Washington on Jan. 6.The original conspiracy case filed against members of the Oath Keepers in late January 2021 has grown to nearly two dozen defendants. In the process, it has danced around Rhodes' involvement in their activities, referring to him as ""Person One"" in court filings. Nine of the 17 defendants in that case were also charged with seditious conspiracy in the new indictment. Advertisement     According to the 48-page, 17-count indictment, Rhodes began preparations for an apparent rebellion on Nov. 5, 2020, just two days after the presidential election, when he invited other Oath Keeper members to a leadership chat on the messaging platform Signal. “We aren’t getting through this without a civil war,” Rhodes wrote at the time. “Too late for that. Prepare your mind, body, spirit.”Over the following weeks and months, prosecutors allege, he employed increasingly fiery language to encourage the group's members to prepare for conflict and, ultimately, to travel to Washington. “It will be a bloody and desperate fight,” he wrote on Signal on Dec. 11. “We are going to have to fight. That can’t be avoided.”Between Dec. 30 and Jan. 2, Rhodes bought some $12,000 worth of firearms and accessories, including a shotgun, night vision goggles, and large amounts of ammunition, the indictment alleges. On Jan. 3, he departed Granbury, Texas, for Washington, stopping twice en route to spend an additional $10,500 on an AR-15 platform rifle, scopes, more ammo, and other accessories. And in the two weeks after Jan. 6, he spent an additional $17,500 on such items.It’s not clear where Rhodes stored such items while in Washington. The indictment details his work to help coordinate a so-called Quick Reaction Force, or QRF, composed of members of the Oath Keepers and associates from Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona who stowed their weapons in a Comfort Inn in Arlington, Virginia.One of those individuals, according to the indictment, was Vallejo, a member of the Oath Keepers chapter in Arizona and a self-described “activist” who served as an alternative delegate for the state’s Republican Party and attended the 2012 Republican National Convention. In a message sent to another member of the Oath Keepers on Jan. 4, he referred to the Comfort Inn as the “allied encampment.” Appearing on a podcast early on Jan. 6, he discussed the possibility of “guerilla war,” noting “there are people who are prepared, have the will, have the facilities to do more than taunt.”Although Rhodes is not accused of entering the Capitol, prosecutors now say he entered “restricted grounds” on Jan. 6 by standing outside the building while it was being stormed, and they detail how he directed the movements of people who ended up penetrating the complex. Amid the chaos, Rhodes reacted to incoming messages that were claiming members of antifa were pushing past the Capitol Police. Advertisement     “Nope. I’m right here,” Rhodes responded. “These are Patriots.”Later that night, the charging document claims, Rhodes joined several other members of the Oath Keepers celebrating the day’s events at a restaurant in Vienna, Virginia. Amid the festivities, he sent out an encrypted message: “Patriots entering their own Capitol to send a message to the traitors is NOTHING compared to what’s coming.”Given the encrypted nature of the Signal chats Rhodes engaged in, it’s not clear how prosecutors were able to gather their evidence. Federal agents seized Rhodes’ phone last May, and he sat for an interview with the FBI in July. In September, the government also used a search warrant to seize attorney SoRelle’s phone. That warrant identified “seditious conspiracy” as a possible crime being investigated.Meanwhile, four other alleged members of the Oath Keepers have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department, presumably sharing their phones with investigators. Although little has been heard from those people, last month, prosecutors said they were continuing to help the government.The new indictment effectively splits the Oath Keepers defendants into separate cases. The original case, which charges conspiracy to interfere with Congress’s activities but not seditious conspiracy, is slimmed down to seven defendants.Rhodes, meanwhile, faces the sedition-related charge, along with the other conspiracy count, alongside Kelly Meggs, Kenneth Harrelson, Jessica Watkins, Joshua James, Roberto Minuta, Joseph Hackett, David Moerschel, Brian Ulrich, and Thomas Caldwell. Rhodes and seven of the other defendants were also charged with obstruction for deleting electronic records in the wake of Jan. 6.Prosecutors have also secured a separate new indictment against a previous Oath Keepers defendant, Jonathan Walden, who is charged with obstructing Congress and illegally being at the Capitol, but he does not face any conspiracy allegation.It was not immediately clear what impact the new charges will have on the court’s schedule. Shortly before the holidays, US District Judge Amit Mehta rejected efforts by the defendants in the Oath Keepers case to get the conspiracy charges tossed out. The judge had planned to begin trial on one group of Oath Keepers in April, with a possible second trial in July. It now seems likely that the first trial date will no longer be at play. Advertisement     Unlike many of the charges brought against alleged Capitol rioters so far, which have focused on the physical criminal acts committed that day — such as assaulting police, disrupting Congress’s certification of the election results, and simply illegally being in the Capitol — sedition deals with a person’s intent to go against the US government.The felony offense makes it a crime to “conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States.”In a public address last week marking the one-year anniversary of the Capitol attack, Attorney General Merrick Garland signaled that people who hadn’t gone into the Capitol could still face prosecution for any involvement in the insurrection. “The Justice Department remains committed to holding all Jan. 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law,” he said, “whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.”The Oath Keepers, along with the Proud Boys, have been a point of focus for the select congressional committee investigating Jan. 6. In November, the committee subpoenaed Rhodes to provide documents and a deposition, citing “credible evidence of” his involvement in the Capitol insurrection.According to Moseley, Rhodes was scheduled to appear before the committee on Feb. 2. The attorney represents Kelly Meggs, one of the other members of the Oath Keepers who is now indicted for seditious conspiracy, and had hoped Rhodes could be a witness for his client in the case. At the time the FBI called on Thursday, Moseley and Rhodes were discussing whether the group leader would answer the committee’s questions or invoke the Fifth Amendment, the lawyer said. It took a few minutes for Rhodes to go outside, he added, because he was not yet dressed at the time.“I am incredibly relieved,” said Tasha Adams, who filed for divorce from Rhodes in early 2018, claiming that he had been physically and emotionally abusive to her and their children. “I feel like I just set down a heavy weight that I have been carrying. The weight of constant fear, of always looking over my shoulder to make sure my kids are safe.” Advertisement

115,The incident reportedly occurred after a fan asked Ye for an autograph.,"


Kanye West, who legally changed his name to Ye last year, has been named a suspect in connection to a battery that occurred early Thursday, police said.The alleged attack happened around 3 a.m. near Santa Fe Avenue and Bay Street, just outside of the Soho Warehouse, an exclusive club in downtown Los Angeles, said LAPD spokesperson Redina Puentes.Police did not release details on the incident, but Fox LA reported that a fan walked up to Ye's car and asked for an autograph.An argument was sparked during the exchange, and Ye then allegedly punched the fan, knocking them to the ground.Puentes said police were called to the area and a report was taken at the site, but no arrests have been made.TMZ reported that Ye had been at a nightclub in West Hollywood with Julia Fox earlier on Wednesday night, but left the club early.A representative for Ye did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

116,"The recording, the lawyer said, “shows what some of us already know: That there’s this chumminess that goes on behind closed doors and makes you wonder whether cases are being heard on the merits or f","


A Chicago criminal court judge was caught on camera Tuesday disparaging a high-profile civil rights attorney who had represented a client in their courtroom less than an hour earlier.“Can you imagine waking up next to her every day? Oh my god,” Cook County Circuit Court judge William B. Raines said in reference to Jennifer Bonjean, an attorney who recently convinced the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to toss out comedian Bill Cosby’s conviction. Advertisement     “There would be a number of things wrong with my life if I was waking up next to her every day,” Assistant State’s Attorney Susie Bucaro, also on the livestream, replied to the judge.None of the participants in the conversation, which included two prosecutors and a public defender, seemed to realize that their comments were being livestreamed on YouTube. Many routine court hearings in Chicago, and elsewhere across the country, are now conducted on video due to COVID-19.“Oh, wait,” Raines said. “Media streaming live on YouTube? What’s up with this?” The recording then stops.Bonjean told BuzzFeed News she was unaware of the video recording until receiving an anonymous tip several hours after the hearing. Raines recused himself from the case Wednesday after Bonjean filed an emergency motion to preserve the video. The case has since been reassigned to another judge. A video of the livesteam is no longer publicly available but BuzzFeed News obtained a copy of the transcript of the comments. Advertisement     The recording, Bonjean said, “shows what some of us already know: That there's this chumminess that goes on behind closed doors and makes you wonder whether cases are being heard on the merits or for some other reason.”Bonjean appeared virtually before Raines on behalf of a Chicago man who claims police framed him for a murder he did not commit. In 2017, BuzzFeed News published an investigation showing that the man, Roosevelt Myles, had waited for 16 years for a court-ordered hearing to reevaluate his conviction.Myles, 57, served 28 years before completing his sentence in 2020. He is still awaiting a reexamination of his case that the courts had ordered four decades ago.Attorneys at Tuesday’s hearing discussed footage from an investigative television series, Reasonable Doubt, that profiled Myles’ case and determined that he was likely innocent of the 1992 murder for which he was convicted. Bonjean told Raines she had no objection to the prosecution collecting video from the television show but claimed the prosecutor, Todd Dombrowski, lied in a motion to obtain the video. Dombrowski denied the charge in front of the judge. He was not on the livestream when Raines made his derisive comments.In a court filing, Bonjean characterized Bucaro's comment as anti-gay. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Bucaro said that the comment had nothing to do with sexual orientation and was a hypothetical reference to having an extra-marital affair.Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, who oversees the prosecutors mocking Bonjean, issued an immediate apology to the attorney.“I assure you that this behavior is unacceptable and runs counter to the values of this administration,” Foxx wrote, calling the prosecutors’ comments “unprofessional.”In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Foxx’s office reiterated her disappointment.“Their actions reflect poorly on the work of our office and the entire criminal justice system,” the statement reads, noting that Foxx had spoken directly with both prosecutors and “as a personnel matter, this will be addressed appropriately.” Advertisement     A spokesperson for Cook County Chief Judge Timothy Evans’ office said judges cannot comment on pending cases.Raines won a 2014 election for his seat on the bench after a career in private practice, as a prosecutor, and as a police officer. Voters elected to retain him in 2020. That same year the Chicago Bar Association rated him “qualified.”Bonjean said the Raines video underscores a structural problem within the Cook County criminal court system, the country’s second largest. Prosecutors and public defenders are assigned to handle cases in front of one judge. That, she said, encourages both prosecutors and public defenders to try to curry favor with the judge for the sake of their clients or careers. Bonjean said that power differential may have been a factor in the attorneys’ decisions to join Raines in criticizing her.Meanwhile, Myles, whose fate is at the heart of the case that Raines once presided over, sat silently in a collared shirt and navy blue sweater on the livestream. After learning of the judge’s comments, he expressed doubts about ever having the opportunity to clear his name.“This just shows what we’re up against,” he said.

117,"“It’s not only saying ‘We didn’t consider chronically ill and disabled people when we created these guidelines,’ but ‘We also don’t care if you die.’”","


Kayle Hill hasn’t left her apartment since Dec. 27. A 25-year-old disabled person, she’s taking isolation more seriously than ever before to avoid exposure to the contagious Omicron variant of COVID. She’s stopped her practice of making short visits to local spots, only goes outside to occasionally pick up curbside deliveries, and will miss a medical appointment to address pain this month.While nondisabled people may be calmed by the idea that Omicron is a less severe version of COVID, the threat of a highly transmissible version of a deadly infection is as scary as ever for people with weakened immune systems. And recent comments by top COVID leadership that flippantly passed over the very real threat COVID still poses to immunocompromised people were met with frustration from people like Hill. Advertisement     “It terrifies me to my core,” Hill said of this phase of the pandemic. “As immunocompromised people can never be sure that their body responded sufficiently to the vaccine, many of us — while so incredibly thankful for the vaccine and the layer of protection it provides — have to live as though we are in a pre-vaccine world.”Hill lives with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and degenerative disc disease in her back, as well as rheumatoid arthritis, for which she takes an immunosuppressant. She told BuzzFeed News it’s “absurd” that Omicron has been hailed as a “milder” version of the virus while she considers this time to be the most dangerous phase of the pandemic yet for the roughly 7 million immunocompromised people in the US.
 


The CDC has recommended that moderately or severely immunocompromised people receive a fourth shot of the COVID vaccine in 2022. But the sheer rapidity of the spread of Omicron has posed a very real immediate threat for people with immunosuppressive conditions because they can get sick more easily and are more likely to develop severe illness. A healthy immune response to the vaccine is needed to create protective antibodies, and therefore vaccines are less likely to be effective in people who are immunocompromised.People who live with a disability, chronic illness, or other immunosuppressive conditions have shared their message on social media that managing their risk shouldn’t only be up to them, using the #MyDisabledLifeIsWorthy hashtag started by disability activist Imani Barbarin.They have also adopted extreme protective measures to prevent COVID exposure, such as canceling or missing medical appointments, quitting jobs, or staying at home in self-imposed lockdown.“There’s no such thing as too cautious at this point if we want to protect chronically ill or disabled people,” Hill said.When she moved to Waterbury, Connecticut, in 2020, Hill struggled to find a pain management medical team that worked with Medicaid. But then she finally got a job with private insurance, found a new doctor, got an MRI, and was suggested a pain treatment plan involving occasional injections.“I was thrilled,” Hill said. “I was really looking forward to it.”But as the number of COVID cases rose in Waterbury, Hill decided to cancel the Jan. 19 appointment — she couldn’t risk exposure in the small waiting room that on previous visits had been very crowded.After she canceled, Hill broke down in tears knowing that she’d have to continue living in pain despite overcoming so many other barriers to getting the healthcare she needs.
 


Hill said she has “a lot of anger” toward the government because it has few plans of action other than widespread vaccination to combat COVID. While getting a shot is effective for people who don't have a disability, she said, it’s not possible for people like her to ever feel totally sure their body responded effectively to the vaccine. The government needs to back up vaccination with other elements, such as mask mandates and limited capacity in public spaces, she said, or else people with weakened immunity must continue living in fear of potentially severe infection.“With so few other mitigation strategies in place, community spread is beyond what we’ve seen before, again leaving immunocompromised people in a particularly vulnerable situation,” Hill said.Last week, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in an interview with Good Morning America that it was reassuring news that most of the people dying of Omicron were those with multiple comorbidities, or preexisting conditions.“Over 75% of deaths occurred in people with at least four comorbidities, so really these are people who are unwell to begin with,” Walensky said. “Really encouraging news in the context of Omicron.”But what sounds encouraging to a nondisabled person navigating the pandemic can actually mean an increased danger for people like Hill if it leads to the general public acting more recklessly.And exercising caution has put immunocompromised people in the balance of deciding which elements of healthcare they’re willing to put off to avoid a higher risk of exposure to COVID.“If I were to skip an infusion, my disease would become active and I’d end up hospitalized,” said Tessa Miller, a Brooklyn-based health journalist and author who is chronically ill. Miller lives with Crohn’s disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease where the immune system attacks the digestive tract. She also has celiac disease, an immune response to gluten that can also damage the small intestine.
 


Miller receives immunosuppressant infusions every six weeks at a chemotherapy center, and even though COVID is a risk, she said she can’t skip the appointments because they keep her chronic illness in check. Miller decided to put off other medical treatments, though, including seeing a neurologist to treat migraines caused by the infusion treatment until COVID cases go down.“Being hospitalized right now is my worst nightmare, not just because of the risk of COVID, but because the system is entirely overwhelmed and I don’t want to add to that,” she said.People with disabilities or chronic illnesses are “tired” from the pandemic, Miller said, adding that the CDC’s COVID messaging — though it hasn’t surprised her — treats disabled people as “disposable.”“If the pandemic has revealed anything, it’s that the economy comes before all else and that we should be willing to die for it,” Miller said. “It’s not only saying ‘We didn’t consider chronically ill and disabled people when we created these guidelines,’ but ‘We also don’t care if you die.’”Miller hasn’t socialized since February 2020. She didn’t experience a return to public transit rides or long-awaited vacations as nondisabled people have postvaccination. She said her world just feels “smaller and lonelier.”If chronically ill and disabled people had been sought for guidance from the start of the pandemic, she said there would have been more stringent measures to limit the virus’s spread. She said officials would have done things like pay people to stay home or get vaccinated, make remote work a standard, provide universal childcare, and study the long-term effects of COVID to anticipate a new group of people with disabilities.“We don’t know how else to say that our lives are worth living and that we’re worth listening to,” Miller said. “Had chronically ill and disabled people been looked to for guidance and leadership from the start of the pandemic, I can guarantee we’d be in a lot better shape than we are now.” Advertisement     Nondisabled people may find solace in sharing the idea that everyone will contract Omicron at some point so it can’t be that bad. But to Rumor Noelle, this is like saying to immunocompromised people that they should be getting ready for severe illness or death.Noelle, a 26-year-old full-time student in Hampton, New Hampshire, said it’s “extremely inaccessible” to even get a COVID test if you don't have a disability. Since they are living with cerebral palsy, someone has to drive them to get a PCR test, and home tests are extremely expensive given how much they’re already paying for medication and medical bills.
 


Noelle sees about seven doctors a month, but when they saw reports that some medical professionals were testing positive, they canceled appointments for January with a pain specialist and a surgery consultation to address pain in their legs and arms. Now they’ll have to buy extra pain relievers and ice packs until they can get another appointment.“As that gets worse, I still have to worry about what happens if I get COVID,” Noelle said, adding that it’s frustrating that people with disabilities even have to use a hashtag as a reminder they deserve to live.The only time Noelle leaves home is to go to their job as a receptionist — a job they started in December after giving up a previous position at a crowded restaurant due to the higher risk of COVID exposure. Now they’re considering quitting again because coworkers have come to the office with COVID symptoms. But leaving a job is scary, Noelle said, because it’s difficult to find an employer that will accommodate frequent medical appointments.“Disabled people have been right about everything in this pandemic,” Noelle said. “Everyone's a little desensitized and too OK with disabled people’s deaths. … It’s like we’re sacrificing disabled people to make room for the new disabled people who are here because of long COVID and COVID in general.” Advertisement     Peter Morley, 52, has lived with chronic pain and illnesses for 15 years, including lupus, and is a kidney cancer survivor. The New York–based patient advocate has left home as little as possible during the pandemic and has missed or rescheduled myriad medical appointments because he said he feels “too vulnerable” to COVID in a hospital setting.
 


“I have reprioritized my health issues and appointments, something I would never do pre-COVID-19,” Morley said.He’s overdue for an endoscopy for liver disease, which can only be done by a hepatologist at a hospital. But like Hill, Morley said he feared narrow corridors and other closed spaces in the hospital with people who could potentially be unvaccinated, aren’t masked, or aren’t social distancing.When he gets stressed about taking care of his body, “my diseases act accordingly,” Morley said. If his mental health triggers some of his conditions, it could lead to hospitalization, so he’s working with a therapist remotely, something he said not everyone in his position can access.“And it’s not just us that it terrifies — our caregivers are just as alarmed,” Morley said. “We are children, parents, grandparents, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, and we are your neighbors. We are not statistics.”

118,The Buckingham Palace statement came one day after a New York federal judge declined to dismiss a civil sexual assault case against the Duke of York.,"


Prince Andrew's honorary military appointments and royal patronages have been removed by the Queen, Buckingham Palace said in a statement Thursday.The Palace said that Andrew, 61, stepped down from his patronages — the 66 charities of which he was the royal patron, according to the royal family's official website — ""with the Queen's approval and agreement."" Advertisement     Thursday's statement came one day after a New York federal judge declined to dismiss a civil sexual assault case against the Duke of York.""The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending the case as a private citizen,"" reads the Buckingham Palace statement released via social media.Virginia Giuffre, 38, alleges that Andrew — a longtime friend and travel companion of disgraced financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in federal prison in while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges — sexually abused her on three occasions between 2000 and 2002 while she was under the age of 18. Giuffre has accused the Duke of York in court documents and interviews of sexually assaulting her in London, New York, and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands despite knowing that she was a sex trafficking victim.Andrew has denied Giuffre's claims.On Aug. 9, 2021, Giuffre sued Andrew for battery and emotional damages under New York’s Child Victims Act of 2019, a short-term law that allowed people over the age of 55 to file civil lawsuits related to childhood sexual abuse — no matter how long ago the incident — but only during a limited time period. Advertisement     Although Andrew and his lawyers fought to have the case thrown out, a New York federal judge on Wednesday declined to dismiss the lawsuit, which will go to trial unless it is settled out of court.
 


Giuffre first accused Andrew of sexual assault in a sworn statement for a defamation case against Epstein and his former girlfriend and recently convicted coconspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, in December 2014. Giuffre's claims became known to the public when that document and other records from this case were unsealed in 2019.Soon after the documents came out, Andrew issued a statement saying that he did not “see, witness or suspect any behavior of the sort that subsequently led to [Epstein's] arrest and conviction."" He also admitted that he had made a mistake by maintaining the friendship after Epstein pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida and served 13 months in jail.“I have said previously that it was a mistake and an error to see him after his release [from prison] in 2010 and I can only reiterate my regret that I was mistaken to think that what I thought I knew of him was evidently not the real person, given what we now know,"" he said. ""I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behavior,”The Duke of York addressed his friendship with Epstein and strongly denied Giuffre's claims in a disastrous BBC interview that aired Nov. 16, 2019, and caused such a public outcry that Andrew resigned from public duties mere days after it aired. Advertisement     In it, he denied ever meeting Giuffre — despite a now-infamous picture that shows the duke with his arm around the then-17-year-old's waist. He said that her story of dancing with him at a club was false, because she described him as being sweaty and he has a medical condition that prevents him from sweating. Andrew also said that on one of the nights Giuffre said he was with her, he was at a Pizza Express with his daughter Beatrice.
 


On Nov. 20, 2019, Buckingham Palace issued a statement from the Duke of York in which he said he was stepping back from public duties ""for the foreseeable future.""""It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organizations and charities that I am proud to support,"" he said.He has not performed any public duties in more than two years, but until Thursday, his honorary military titles and patronages were ""in abeyance"" (i.e., suspended) and he was still nominally associated with them.

119,"Jamie Lynn calling Britney “erratic, paranoid and spiraling,” has reminded fans of how Justin Timberlake notoriously demonized the pop star in highly publicized interviews throughout their breakup.","


Under the legal arrangement, which had been in effect since 2008, Britney's father and lawyers controlled her life and finances. The conservatorship was terminated in November last year after a protracted legal battle.
 


BuzzFeed News uncovered abuse, neglect, and death across the guardianship industry. Read our investigative series ""Beyond Britney"" here.


 


“When [the conservatorship] was put into place I was a 17-year-old. I was about to have a baby, so I didn’t understand what was happening,” she said. “Nor was I focused on that. I was focused on the fact that I was a 17-year-old about to have a baby. I understand just as little about it then as I do now.”
 


“There was a time where my sister asked me — of her trust and will — if I would be the person who was sure that her boys got what they needed,” she said.“Once I realized that ... she’s in a conservatorship, I felt like I just didn’t want to be a part of [it] until maybe she was out of the conservatorship,” she said.“There was no me overseeing funds or something like that, and if that was, it was a misunderstanding,” she said. “Either way, I took no steps to be a part of it.”
 


“I went out of my way to make sure that she had the contacts she needed to possibly go ahead and end this conservatorship, and just end this all for our family,” she said. “If it’s gonna cause this much discord, why continue it?”She added, “If she wanted to talk to other people … I set that up. I even spoke to her legal team … previous legal team, and that did not end well in my favor.”
 


“I actually teared up watching this. I’m so so so sorry for Britney that after all they have done her family continues… gaslighting and [sponging] off of her,” another tweet said.
 


What’s more, Justin notoriously made disrespectful comments about Britney in a series of interviews over the course of their breakup. For example, he made crude remarks about their sex life while speaking with Hot 97, saying, “I did it. I'm dirty,” when asked if he’d had “oral intercourse” with her. Advertisement     
 


“This. This. This,” one person replied in agreement.
 


“I specifically want to apologize to Britney Spears and Janet Jackson both individually, because I care for and respect these women and I know I failed,” he noted.
"
120,"In the aughts, actor Tara Reid was pummeled by the press for partying and plastic surgery. Now, she wants everyone to just move on.","


As soon as we met, Tara Reid said she had brought me something. She pulled a small orange satchel from her pocket and handed it to me. “I made it myself. I picked every bead,” she said. Inside was a friendship bracelet made with turquoise, silver, and little rivets etched with words like “Beautiful” and “Believe.” She advised me to put it under moonlight to charge the crystals with good energy. Reid, like a lot of women who spent their entire adult lives living and working in Hollywood, is a little witchy, a little woo-woo, not that there’s anything wrong with that.We spoke over the course of a few days in Los Angeles, while the now-46-year-old actor was shooting a lookbook for her new sunglasses line, Cult Queen, and a handbag made in collaboration with designer Michael Kuluva. Before the shoot, she was reserved, almost sleepy, but when the photographer lifted the camera to her sightline, she popped out her leg, offered a smile, and for hours, turned on the charm that made her successful in the first place.This is the kind of behavior one might expect from an actor whose early breakout roles cemented her as an approachable bombshell and America’s Next Sweetheart. In 1998 she played Bunny Lebowski, a former porn star trophy wife who shops constantly, in the cult classic The Big Lebowski. In 1999, she was Vicky in the megahit teen comedy American Pie (and a few sequels), the quintessential girl next door who’s unsure if she really wants to have sex for the first time with her idiot boyfriend. Advertisement  But my favorite — and Reid’s — was her role in 2001’s Josie and the Pussycats. I always loved Melody, the band’s dim but sweet drummer. In the Archie Comics that inspired the film, she’s sidelined to punchlines where she isn’t even in on the joke — everyone thought Melody was an idiot, and they treated her as such, but she was actually just a perennial optimist. And Reid was the perfect vessel for such a character. “Everyone thought she was clueless, but she was actually really smart,” Reid told me.Josie and the Pussycats might have looked and smelled like a typical coming-of-age movie, but it was actually an incisive, brutal commentary on toxic media culture and how easy it is to lose yourself in the fame machine. Who better understands that cycle than Reid? “No matter what I do, even if I stopped acting tomorrow, I’m going to be famous for the rest of my life,” she said. “It wasn’t like I cared about being famous. It just all kind of happened.”At the dawn of the 2000s, Tara Reid was the quintessential It girl: a bankable, beautiful, blonde actor with sparkling blue eyes, perfect for rom-coms and gross-out comedies. But just a couple of years later, the shine had already started to wear off. There were fewer starring roles, in similar horny-slapstick movies (2002’s college comedy Van Wilder, 2003’s hijinks-heavy rom-com My Boss’s Daughter). When even those disappeared, she showed up on reality shows like Hell’s Kitchen and Celebrity Big Brother.
 


Like so many Hollywood women of the era — Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears — Reid’s career and reputation suffered in her early 20s when she hit the party circuit and became known for tabloid photos of her outside Hollywood clubs wearing low-rise jeans and chainmail halter tops. But there are big differences between Reid and her contemporaries: Namely, she never really found herself embroiled in any major scandal. “Yeah, I partied and had fun,” she told me. “We’d pop bottles of champagne. But who doesn’t?”There is no Tara Reid mugshot, no Tara Reid DUI, no Tara Reid prison sentence. “They all were in jail, they all did fucking sex tapes, crazy shit,” Reid said, referring to some of her peers. She said she never got in trouble on movie sets and was always on time. (The only story about her being late to a set is from 2018, when she was removed from a flight for causing a “disturbance,” making her three hours late to filming 5th Borough.) “There’s nothing like that about me,” she said. But it didn’t really matter — soon, perception became reality.If you ask Reid, her reputation as a party girl coincided with her reputation as a professional flake, two things she considers patently false. Elevated publications largely ignored her — she might’ve been on the cover of Maxim and Playboy and FHM, but that attention never really transferred to more roles or more respectability. Soon, her body was endlessly dissected by gossip magazines, with zoomed-in photos of her legs and abs picked apart by bloggers and readers alike.
 


Anyone who’s had their body criticized by a cruel audience, even an audience of just one, can empathize. But Reid hasn’t had her large-scale redemption narrative even as the media has reconsidered narratives about many young white women who were famous in the aughts. Maybe that’s because her story isn’t tragic in the extreme: She’s alive, well, and still working. Monica Lewinsky had her name splashed across every major newspaper in the world, while Spears had to fight for control of even the smallest part of her own life. In comparison, what did Reid endure, apart from the vagaries of fame? The world moved on; maybe she just didn’t suffer enough. Still, the way the media treated women like Reid serves as a kind of allegory for the sexist, targeted, and unjustified ways women have historically been treated.Reid isn’t bitter, but she’d have a right to be. In her 20s, she was primed to be the next big thing, but instead the roles dried up. She tolerated more cruelty than any one person should. Yet, having survived the worst of 2000s tabloid culture, Reid barely wants so much as an apology. “I don’t want people to feel sorry for me,” she said. “I don’t want people to think I’m hung up on that.”As far as she’s concerned, she doesn’t actually require redemption, whether for her sense of self-worth or her career. The way the tabloids talked about her is old news. She hasn’t made any attempt to publicly rewrite her own narrative. She isn’t writing a memoir or trying to sit down with Oprah. She’s simply been working, now producing more than acting, and living a quieter life.But hasn’t she earned an apology? Because, for all the vitriol directed at her, when it comes down to it, Reid only did two things: publicly enjoyed her 20s and altered her body in a way people didn’t approve of. Neither would have ruined her life had the public not reacted so strongly. Her peers are getting absolution. So why can’t she get a break?
 


The current revival of early-aughts fashion — Von Dutch hats and denim skirts like the ones she used to wear to Hyde Lounge — brings back a more personal element of Reid’s troubles with the tabloids. “When I see things people wear sometimes, it reminds me of my mother,” she said. “It’s a very melancholy feeling. She was great. She was a boss.”Reid’s mother died four years ago, and her father around two years before that, but she was always close to them, even after moving from her native New Jersey to Hollywood in the late ‘90s, when she was 20. The media response to her personal life hit them the hardest. “My mom would say it wasn’t fair. She said, ‘I’m going to call these motherfuckers, tell them off,’” Reid said. “She was more angry than I was. She didn’t want to be judged by her friends, by me looking bad. If I could have fixed it, I would have, but it wasn’t up to me at the time.”If she had become famous now, Reid’s partygoing might look like run-of-the-mill celebrity carousing. But in the aughts, it made her a tabloid fixture. Every night out, every relationship, and every change to her body was examined and derided ad nauseam. She was a TMZ and Perez Hilton mainstay — TMZ called her “Franken-nipple” and a “train wreck,” and ran videos making fun of her for being denied entry to clubs, while Perez Hilton covered a clothing line she was working on in a post called “Hookers Rejoice!” It was the era of Britney Spears being photographed without underwear on and Paris Hilton’s sex tape. If gossip blogs needed someone to shit on that afternoon, famous young women were perfect targets.Celebrity bloggers were quick to post close-ups of every trail of cellulite on Reid’s body, every fold on her midsection. Page Six routinely zeroed in on photos of her chest, her stomach, her butt, criticizing every fold and crease. In 2004, she went pre–social media viral when the top of her dress slipped and exposed her breast while she was at a party hosted by P. Diddy. “Tara Reid: Holy Lopsided Boobs!” proclaimed Just Jared in 2007, about red-carpet photos of the starlet smiling placidly in a green dress. In 2008, she received negative attention for paparazzi shots of her in a bikini at the beach, which showed scars left over from a fumbled liposuction procedure. (The scars aren’t that extreme, but the response was so aggressive and swift, you would’ve thought she’d had a head transplant.) “It’s a ghastly, protruding thing, isn’t it?” Lainey Lui wrote on Lainey Gossip in 2011 about Reid’s midsection. “Like it might detach from her and start killing things. Part leather, part plastic, all gross.” Advertisement  
 


Too thin and she was accused of having anorexia, but even rumors of surgical adjustments earned sneering, as if trying to evade mockery was equally worthy of derision. And the more insulting headlines she had to tolerate, the fewer roles she felt like she was being offered. She’s still trying to sort through the consequences. “Why would that affect me so much, especially when there’s never ever been an article about me being unprofessional?”Meanwhile, she was certainly making money for a lot of other people. “When I hosted [TMZ], Harvey [Levin] came up to me and goes, ‘We wouldn’t even have TMZ if it wasn’t for you. You were always the one that was picked on. For us, it was perfect,’” she said. “It wasn’t for me.” (Levin did not respond to requests for comment.) Bloggers like Perez built their own empires on such cruelty. “I found out we had the same publicist, and I [said to the publicist], ‘You’re not protecting me. Everything I tell you, are you telling him?’” she said. “I think he’s the one that ruined my career, to be honest with you.” Advertisement  In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Perez said he didn’t think they ever shared the same publicist, and he denied ever receiving tips about Reid from former or current publicists. But he still couldn’t help himself. “I’m sorry for my past coverage of Tara Reid,” he said. “I could have covered her then-sloppiness and problematic behavior with more empathy.”There are a lot of things Reid doesn’t want to talk about, but the biggest one is speculation about cosmetic surgery. (Before the interview, her publicist asked that I not ask any specific questions about what cosmetic work she has or hasn’t had done, though she was willing to discuss the impact of the tabloid coverage of her body.)In the early aughts, she reportedly received two cosmetic procedures that drastically changed her body in ways she now says she didn’t want. Her breast implants were bigger than what she originally wanted (she said she asked for B cups but received C's instead), and body contouring left her with a midsection she once called “the most ripply, bulgy thing.” She seems protective of herself and her choices, which makes sense considering how often she’s had to defend how she looks. “It was a terrible experience and everyone kept throwing it in my face,” she said. “Like, why are you being so mean?”She figured her options were to either fade away entirely, or to try a new type of public life. While the tabloids were picking her apart, Reid turned to reality TV, the dominion of stars whose A-list status has evaporated. There was the 2005 E! docuseries Taradise, where Reid tried out local cuisine and nightlife in places like Greece, Italy, and Monaco. Reid liked making it but recognizes it probably affirmed the misconceptions about her. Advertisement  
 


“That’s where, really, I think the party girl image came,” she said. “I didn’t realize that would actually hurt me. I thought it would be fun.” There was a 2011 stint on Celebrity Big Brother in the UK, alongside Irish celebrity twins Jedward and David Hasselhoff’s ex-wife, Pamela. Then, in 2016, she appeared on Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars with her “boyfriend” Dean May. She was kicked off the show on the finale when it was revealed that they weren’t a real couple. (Reid declined to discuss the scandal in our interview.)In 2008, she spent two weeks at the Promises Treatment Center, and to outsiders, it seemed like Reid was there to get sober. She said that wasn’t the truth either. “I was dating a guy at the time, he was very destructive. I couldn’t get away from him,” she said. The relationship was so abusive, she said, that her team sent her to rehab to break them up. “The only way was to go to treatment. Everyone thought I had a real problem, and that was the problem.”Reid never wavers in her eye contact when she talks; there’s no insincerity in her delivery. “No one knows the real truth about all the things that happened. This doesn’t even bother me, because I know my truth, but it used to.” Reid talks low and slow, forcing you to lean in to hear her clearly. “How long can you be angry about something?”
 


People who know Reid well paint a vastly different portrait of her than the tabloids did. Twenty years after Josie and the Pussycats, Reid still considers costar Rachael Leigh Cook one of her good friends. Cook was supposed to be a bridesmaid at Reid’s wedding to Carson Daly before it was called off in 2001 — a breakup that tabloids and Daly attributed to Reid’s partying. “To some extent, I dodged a bullet,” Daly told Elle in 2012 in an article titled “I’m Living Proof That the Good Guys Win.” “I was getting serious about my career, and she wanted to shoot movies and just party in her time off.” (Reid didn’t have as much to say about Daly: “We grew apart,” she told me. “We love each other, we care about each other, but I know I can’t spend my whole life with you. In some ways, that’s the hardest breakup in the world.”)“I think Tara’s someone who, as strong and as outspoken as she can be when she needs to be, she doesn’t actually like to look backwards,” Cook told me over the phone. “She’s always somebody who’s kept appropriate blinders going forward toward her own best, most positive path and trajectory.”Cook said that she didn’t hang out with the same “fast crowd” that Reid did, and maybe that insulated her from some of the criticisms her friend had to deal with. But the negative attention struck her as unfair. “I don’t know how she ended up as deeply mistreated as she was,” Cook said. “People would say, ‘Oh, she can’t be the sweet innocent person, not if we saw pictures of her coming out of a club in a crop top.’ That’s absurd.”The aughts starlets who survived cruel press vortexes have done it, in part, by seeking to change their public narrative with domesticity. Hilton is a newlywed, Spears and Lohan are both engaged, and Richie has two kids and a decadelong marriage to Joel Madden. Reid never followed suit, though she does have two dogs (Bella and Beso) and a live-in boyfriend of four years. But she didn’t pursue family life in as public a fashion as, say, Hilton, who recently starred in a reality show on Peacock about her wedding. “I think what they really wanted from me to make the next change was to get married and have kids. Now, she’s a woman,” Reid said. “They wanted to see me have a family, and because I didn’t, it was still fair game.” Advertisement  
 


Not that she hasn’t been offered opportunities to retell her story, like Hilton did in 2020’s This Is Paris (where she discussed her trauma after being abused at a boarding school) or Lohan’s 2014 OWN series (which followed her path toward sobriety and attempted career relaunch). “I’ve been offered a million times to do a memoir or a book,” she said. “The reason why I haven’t done it [is] because I’m not over yet. Why now? As Justin Timberlake would say, I don’t need you to cry me a river.”But doesn’t she want some kind of reckoning? I would, if someone had publicly called me “ghetto tits.” Her insistence that she doesn’t feels almost like a reverse defense mechanism: She’s so used to people mocking her that she doesn’t want to ask for too much. To ask for an apology is to take a risk; it’s too intimate and vulnerable a request from people who might still just call her ugly. Advertisement  
 


These days, bloggers like Lainey Gossip and Perez are offering up mea culpas, and it’s no longer socially acceptable to malign a young woman for going out. “Other stars get a little bit crazy now. Jennifer Lawrence fell down the stairs!” Reid said, referring to that Oscars moment in 2013. “She’s doing late-night talk shows, drinking a beer. If I ever did that, I’d be destroyed.” Still, Lawrence recently gave an interview about how she had to disappear from public life because people were getting sick of her and her relatable antics. The culture hasn’t changed that much — if tabloids want to drag a woman, they’ll find a way no matter what.Reid’s story is a case study for what happens when the stardom you’re poised for goes sideways. Now, her relationship with Hollywood and the public is an uneasy one — and no one knows, not even her, what it’ll look like in the future. Advertisement  In fact, a few months after I interviewed Reid, she was once again harangued after posting a photo of herself in a bikini. The comments came in swiftly, thousands of people assessing whether she might have an eating disorder and criticizing whatever she’s done to her body over the years. (Reid has repeatedly denied ever having any type of eating disorder.) “You need help,” one follower said. “Age isn’t everyone’s friend,” another said. Later that day, Reid posted another photo of herself, along with a statement. “Here is another picture from yesterday to show you I am not too skinny. I have a high metabolism. All I do is eat,” she said. “To everyone who wrote something nice and stuck up for me, I love you! And keep spreading that love, it is the only thing that will save this world.”Reid feels like her 20s still color people’s opinions. “Even to this day, there’s still kind of a thing about me,” Reid said. “Come on, guys. You can’t judge me by my high school picture. I’m 45 years old now.” The hope, maybe, is that people get bored of shitting on her. “Eventually it’s going to go away, and it is going away,” she said. “What are they gonna do? Pick on me when I’m 60? I’m a 90-year-old lady and I have a glass in my hand? Fuck off.”
 


If you’ve seen Reid in a movie in the last few years, it was likely one from the Sharknado franchise, the TV movie absurdities about tornados full of sharks. Reid isn’t divorced from how people perceive her, nor does she have highfalutin ideas about her career. When I asked which of her movies were her least favorite, she didn’t stutter: “Some of the stupid movies I do,” she said. “You know. It’s a paycheck.”Before filming the first Sharknado, Reid was living in London, trying to recover from a decade and a half of ruthless media attention. The city was the last spot on the American Pie Reunion promotional tour in 2012, and instead of going home, she stayed. Nothing was tying her to Hollywood anymore — her last big movie, My Boss’s Daughter (a critical bomb), premiered all the way back in 2003, and her seasonlong stint on Scrubs ended in 2005. “I need[ed] to refocus and find myself, my core again. And it worked, I went there and I lived my life,” she said. It was easier — the tabloids let up, and she felt like she could blend in and do whatever she wanted without constant observation.“My agent called me, like, ‘All right, Tara, you’re not working, we’re not doing anything, you need to work again. You need to come home,’” she said. “So then they gave me this craziest, stupidest script I’ve ever read in my whole entire life called Sharknado.”Reid credits it with reviving her career. “It’s the worst movie of all time. It’s so bad that it’s actually kind of good,” she said. “Let’s have a baby in the shark in outer space. It’s so out there. For Sharknado to bring me back is something I never would’ve expected.” Sharknado wasn’t a critical or commercial darling by any means. But the movie was a success all the same: When it premiered in 2013 on Syfy, it had 1.4 million viewers, on a channel with a typical viewership of less than a million. Its third screening a few weeks later got 2.1 million viewers. (Sharknado 2: The Second One, got 3.9 million viewers on a Wednesday night.) With its aggressive commitment to campy terror, Sharknado is now a cult classic that inspires midnight screenings and themed parties. Advertisement     In 2018, The Last Sharknado: It’s About Time came out, marking the end of the franchise. But the Sharknado movies exposed her to a new audience, as evidenced by a recent flight she took from a vacation in Mexico back home to LA. “The flight attendant comes up to me and he goes, ‘Oh my god, I so loved your movie.’ So of course, I automatically think [of] American Pie,” she said. “And he goes, ‘Sharknado is everything.’ I was like, Is this really happening?”
 


Her next project is the forthcoming Masha’s Mushroom, a thriller about an overworked mother who throws a party for her daughter where all the guests end up dosed with a hallucinogen. Reid plays the mother; Vivica A. Fox and Beverly D’Angelo also star. Reid is also a producer on the movie. Even though she decided to get involved in producing because roles for women her age are famously hard to find, she’s excited about it. “If someone’s not gonna give me that chance, then I was like, I gotta make it for myself,” she said. “I found a great script, great director. I’m so proud of what we’ve accomplished.” Finally, she’s on the other side of the Hollywood equation. “It was so funny this time, calling up the agents that said no to me that I’d like to make an offer to your client,” she said. “To reach out to all these different companies and me being the boss this time, it was like, the table’s turned. It was beyond satisfying.” Advertisement     It’s easy to root for Reid when she tells stories like this. She comes off as open and sweet; she ended our interview by proclaiming “I love you!” into my recorder. And while Reid told me, over and over, that she didn’t want or need a reconsideration, I still want one for her. Whether she’s saying it because it’s true or just a line for a culture that has largely scorned her, she does seem exhausted from explaining herself. She’s tried repeatedly to make it clear that she’s productive, settled, kind, and easygoing. It hasn’t worked so far. Appearing in a well-known movie franchise hasn’t proved it. Refusing to engage in criticism of her body hasn’t either. Wanting to be understood has only led to disappointment, so why not forget about it? Vindication isn’t everything. What could anyone do to make amends? Cry her a river, and then what?Reid has little time for regrets. “I wonder what else I would’ve done,” she said. “Do I take it back? No, I don’t. It’s who I am.”●
"
121,"Amid rising tensions and the approaching Beijing Olympics, the US banned Xinjiang cotton last year. But Hugo Boss still took shipments from Esquel, which gins cotton in Xinjiang.","


This project was supported by the International Women’s Media Foundation.
 


On a balmy day in March, a container ship called the One Munchen docked in Savannah, Georgia. On board was a shipment of button-down shirts made of “peached cotton,” a fuzzy fabric meant to feel as soft as the skin of the fruit. Embroidered on their pockets was the Hugo Boss logo.Now on sale for $82, the shirts feature a slim fit, an embroidered placket, and a promise: Hugo Boss had not sourced its cotton from China’s Xinjiang region, where forced labor is rampant. But these button-downs — along with dozens of other clothing shipments brought into the United States within the last year by Hugo Boss, Tommy Hilfiger, and other clothing brands — were produced by a large Chinese company called Esquel Group. And that’s a red flag.
 


Forced labor is so pervasive in China's far west region of Xinjiang — and government control over information is so absolute — that it is nearly impossible to establish if forced labor is being used in supply chains there. But here’s what is known:Esquel Group gins and spins cotton in Xinjiang.In July 2020, the US government placed trade restrictions on one of its Xinjiang subsidiaries, Changji Esquel Textile Co., citing concerns over forced labor.In January 2021, US regulators banned all Xinjiang cotton from entering the US, again citing forced labor.Since the cotton ban, a different Esquel subsidiary located in Guangdong — hundreds of miles away from Xinjiang — has continued exporting its clothes to brands in the US. But procurement records and company statements reviewed by BuzzFeed News show that Esquel’s Guangdong branch works together with its Xinjiang-based cotton spinning factories. When asked repeatedly, neither Hugo Boss nor Tommy Hilfiger nor Ralph Lauren would say where the cotton in their Esquel shipments comes from.Esquel’s own public statements make clear that its Xinjiang cotton production is deeply intertwined with its worldwide clothing operation. The company describes itself as “vertically integrated,” meaning that it owns factories for each stage of the cotton supply chain: Esquel’s gins separate cotton fibers from seeds, and those fibers are later spun into yarn in Esquel’s spinning mills. Esquel’s Guangdong factories knit and weave cotton yarn to make cloth, then use this to manufacture clothing that can be exported to the rest of the world via the Hong Kong–based Esquel Enterprises. The company owns at least two cotton ginning companies in Xinjiang, where the bulk of China’s cotton is grown — but makes no public reference to owning any cotton ginning facilities outside the region.Since the US ban against all Xinjiang cotton began last January, at least 16 Esquel shipments have arrived in the US for Hugo Boss, trade records show, the latest one in mid-December. One shipment has arrived addressed to PVH, the parent company of Tommy Hilfiger, containing Tommy Hilfiger–branded goods; four for Ralph Lauren; and one for Polo, a Ralph Lauren subsidiary. Guangdong Esquel, along with other Esquel companies, is still listed as a supplier in Hugo Boss’s most recently published supplier list. PVH had included Guangdong Esquel on its supplier list, as well as Esquel subsidiaries in Vietnam and Sri Lanka, but in late December — after BuzzFeed News reached out for comment — PVH released an updated version of its list, and no Esquel subsidiaries were on it. No Esquel companies appear in Ralph Lauren’s latest list, which was published in November.Hugo Boss said in a statement that it had contacted Esquel, and the company had replied that “all our specifications and standards, including the observance of human rights and fair working conditions, have been and are being complied with.” Hugo Boss also said its own audits at Esquel production facilities revealed no evidence of the use of forced labor.PVH and Ralph Lauren did not respond to requests for comment.In response to a list of questions, Esquel said it had never used and would never use coerced or forced labor. It added that it follows all national import and export laws, and that it does not sell products banned in specific jurisdictions.Asked what regions it sources cotton from other than Xinjiang, Esquel did not give any specifics, saying only that it sources from “most of the key cotton producing countries globally.”The Esquel shipments raise questions not only about whether these brands continue to sell products that use cotton grown in Xinjiang but also about whether the US ban is truly enforceable.“Cotton is grown in Xinjiang, but then it is sold to warehouses, processors, and suppliers all over China,” said Laura Murphy, professor of human rights and contemporary slavery at Sheffield Hallam University, who has conducted research on forced labor in Xinjiang. And then it moves on as raw cotton or as yarn and fabric to the rest of the world. “Every time it moves, its provenance is increasingly obscured. There are many ways to track it, but so far most companies don’t seem invested in knowing where their raw cotton comes from.”A Customs and Border Protection spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that under US law, importers must take “reasonable care” in ensuring their supply chains are free of forced labor. Asked what constitutes “reasonable care,” the spokesperson said companies are encouraged to “become familiar with applicable laws and regulations” and work with the agency to protect consumers from “harmful and counterfeit imports.”As part of its campaign targeting Muslims, the Chinese government has put in place labor programs in which Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities are made to work on farms and in factories. The US has labeled the campaign a genocide and has applied increasing pressure on the Chinese government, including a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. The US has continued to escalate trade prohibitions during that time: The US banned cotton and tomato imports from the region in January 2021, but last month Congress passed a law mandating that all goods from Xinjiang must be stopped at the border on suspicion that they are made with forced labor, placing the burden of proof on importers.The region has long been a top source of cotton for international companies. China is currently the world’s leading producer of cotton, with over 87% of that coming from Xinjiang. Research shows that forced labor in the region is not restricted to factory work — there is also evidence of forced labor in cotton picking in southern Xinjiang.The Xinjiang cotton ban has become a flashpoint in the larger diplomatic row between the US and China, with the Chinese government, along with Chinese consumers and celebrities, pressuring international clothing brands to continue sourcing in the region as a show of patriotic support.Human rights groups welcomed the ban but were skeptical it could be fully enforced. They say forced labor by Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minority groups, underpinned by government programs, is so widespread in Xinjiang that it’s nearly impossible for any companies that source there to ensure their suppliers don’t use it. The political sensitivity of the issue, combined with the government’s other repressive measures targeting minority groups, has made it even more difficult for foreign companies to audit their supply chains.The Better Cotton Initiative, an industry group that promotes sustainability by auditing its supply chains, stopped its reviews in Xinjiang altogether in October 2020, citing “an increasingly untenable operating environment.” Five firms did the same.Esquel is the world’s largest maker of woven cotton shirts, providing major brands with more than 100 million every year, earning the company more than $1.3 billion in yearly revenue. Esquel operates two cotton ginning mills in Xinjiang and three spinning mills, where cotton is spun into yarn. BuzzFeed News was able to geolocate the three spinning mills in Xinjiang and the garment factories in Guangdong, matching images of these facilities on Esquel’s website with satellite imagery and street-level imagery from Baidu Total View and confirming their locations. The book Esquel produced to celebrate the company’s 40th anniversary describes how its spinning mill in Xinjiang’s Turpan prefecture was established specifically to supply the Guangdong factories. By 2018, the book adds, Esquel’s investment in Xinjiang amounted to $100 million, including charitable donations. The company did not answer a question about whether that supply route has changed.
 


Esquel has said publicly that it uses long-staple cotton, which is prized in the industry for its durability and luxe feel. About a fifth of the world’s long-staple cotton is produced in Xinjiang’s Aksu prefecture, and according to the company’s website, Esquel has two subsidiaries based in Aksu: Akesu Esquel Agricultural Development Company Ltd. and Akesu Esquel Cotton Industrial Company Ltd. Esquel’s own literature describes Awati County in Aksu as the “Home of China’s ELS Cotton,” referring to extra-long-staple cotton, and said it became “a major plantation site of Esquel’s quality cotton” starting in 2002. In addition to China, the company has cloth and garment production facilities in Vietnam and Sri Lanka.Hugo Boss is a member of the Better Cotton Initiative and says that 86% of its purchased cotton is “sustainable,” citing environmental standards as well as “socio-economic factors.”
 


In July 2020, following a report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute on Uyghur forced labor, the US announced sanctions against 11 Chinese companies including Changji Esquel Textile, one of the five Esquel subsidiaries based in Xinjiang. The sanctions announcement described these companies as being “implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and high-technology surveillance against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.” These sanctions made it difficult, but not impossible, for US brands to trade with the companies outright — but the reputational damage meant that brands were reluctant to be seen working with them.Nike, which the ASPI report had named as working with Changji Esquel, issued a statement denying any relationship to the company. Hugo Boss said that it was asking all of its suppliers whether they were using any products made in Xinjiang. (Esquel launched an appeal, saying that the company “does not use forced labor” and “never will use forced labor.” But in October, a federal judge refused to lift trade curbs on the company.)
 


The January 2021 ban on all Xinjiang cotton added a further layer of restriction and put major clothing brands under a fresh spotlight. Hugo Boss posted conflicting promises about what it would do next.In Chinese, on the company’s official Weibo account, Hugo Boss said, “we will continue to purchase and support Xinjiang cotton … For many years, we have respected the one-China principle, resolutely defending national sovereign and territorial integrity.” Around the same time, the company said in an English-language statement that it had “not procured any goods in the Xinjiang region from direct suppliers.”Hugo Boss later walked the Chinese language statement back, saying it had not been authorized. That led Chinese celebrities to cancel deals with the brand as part of a pressure campaign to keep it from backing down.With the Xinjiang bans in force, Esquel continued to export clothes through its other subsidiaries based in Guangdong province and Hong Kong. Trade records on the Panjiva platform, the supply-chain research unit at S&P Global Market Intelligence, show 36 Esquel Enterprises shipments have arrived at US ports since the introduction of sanctions, including Seattle; Savannah, Georgia; Newark, New Jersey; New York; Los Angeles; Long Beach, California; Pittsburgh; Baltimore; and Boston. According to the trade records, their combined value was $1,473,490. Hugo Boss’s most recent shipment arrived at the Port of Seattle on Dec. 18, bound for Hugo Boss Canada. Advertisement  Sixteen of those shipments went to Hugo Boss. BuzzFeed News was able to identify 30 different clothing products from these shipments — including white button-down blouses branded as “organic cotton poplin.” BuzzFeed News then found these items being sold under the Hugo Boss brand both by the brand’s own website and by other retailers, including ModeSens and Amazon. ModeSens did not respond to a request for comment, and Amazon declined to comment.
 


BuzzFeed News matched items of clothing sold online with those described in shipping records using the eight-digit numerical “style codes” associated with them, which also appear on the websites where they are being sold. Hugo Boss also named three Esquel factories in Guangdong in its most recently published supplier list in May 2021. Advertisement  
 


A document seen by BuzzFeed News shows how Esquel’s Xinjiang branch works with its Guangdong operation. At the start of August, Xinjiang Esquel issued a joint tender with the Guangdong branch, requesting bids for the transport of cotton materials. The winner of the bid would go under contract with the two Esquel branches between Aug. 1, 2021, and Jan. 31 of this year, according to the document. The companies sought suppliers that had recently gone through qualification inspections that year.On Dec. 2, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights launched a criminal complaint in the Netherlands against Dutch apparel brands that source from Esquel companies among other Chinese suppliers with Xinjiang ties. The group argues that Esquel’s “vertically integrated” structure all but ensures that the cotton it gins in Xinjiang ends up with its other subsidiaries that export clothes to Western countries. “It is unacceptable that European governments criticize China for human rights violations while these companies possibly profit from the exploitation of the Uyghur population,” said Corina Ajder, a legal adviser at ECCHR. “It is high time that responsible corporate officers are investigated and — if necessary — held to account.” The group filed a similar complaint in France in April and in Germany in September. The German filing named Hugo Boss, along with other German-registered companies. Hugo Boss has said it rejects the claims made by ECCHR. Advertisement  Tommy Hilfiger’s owner, the American apparel giant PVH, also owns brands including Calvin Klein. PVH told the New York Times in July 2020 that it would end its relationships with fabric producers in Xinjiang, as well as cotton suppliers from the region, within a year.An examination of trade records shows that the Chinese Esquel factories exported at least 12 different styles of Tommy Hilfiger–branded clothing to the United States in February. Several of these items are still on sale on the brand’s website, albeit currently sold out.Matching the products’ style codes to Tommy Hilfiger products sold on its website shows they range from sweaters and pullovers to knit skirts and dresses. One cream-colored crewneck sweater, which bears the brand’s logo, is advertised as being made with “organic cotton,” as were other products. The clothing sells for between $68 and $150.●

123,"Petito was likely “a long-term victim of domestic violence,” the report acknowledged.","


The police officers who investigated a domestic dispute between Gabby Petito and her fiancé shortly before her death made several mistakes and should be placed on probation, according to an independent review released Wednesday.The report found that the two Moab police officers who contacted Petito and Brian Laundrie on Aug. 12, 2021, after being alerted to a ""domestic problem"" failed to cite Petito for domestic violence, misinterpreted Utah's assault code, did not take photographs of her injuries, and neglected to contact the 911 caller who reported seeing Laundrie slap Petito, among other issues. The mistakes they made, however, were not intentional, and it's impossible to say what impact they may have had on her death, concluded Price City, Utah, police Capt. Brandon Ratcliffe, who conducted the review. Advertisement     ""The officers did not know what they were doing was wrong at the time and did not make the decision to benefit themselves in any way,"" Ratcliffe wrote. ""They both believed at the time they were making the right decision based on the totality of the circumstances that were presented.""In addition to placing the officers on probation, Ratcliffe recommended that Eric Pratt and Daniel Robbins receive additional training on report writing and investigating domestic violence, as well as overall reviews of how the Moab Police Department approves reports and its requirements on gathering photographic evidence of injuries sustained by and offering medical assistance to all individuals involved in an incident. He also advised that Moab police follow up with the 911 caller that the officers failed to interview, despite the time that has passed since their report.In a statement, the city said it planned to implement the recommendations.""As the Moab City Police Department continues its daily mission to serve our community, efforts are underway to provide additional resources and tools to assist the[m] in addressing domestic violence incidents,"" the statement read.The disappearance and death of Petito, the 22-year-old aspiring social media influencer who went missing while documenting her #VanLife cross-country road trip with Laundrie on Instagram and YouTube, captivated the internet last year. After a coroner determined the cause of her death was strangulation, domestic violence survivors and advocates raised concerns about what they believed should have tipped off Moab police that Petito's life was in danger.""If this case was handled flawlessly, would it have changed anything?"" Ratcliffe wrote in his report. ""Nobody knows.""
 


In his report, Ratcliffe concluded that Petito was likely ""a long-term victim of domestic violence,"" but he suggested that officers could not have known that from the information they had at the time.He described the ways in which Laundrie tried to control Petito's movements and said that the act of grabbing Petito's face — which survivors told BuzzFeed News was a red flag for potential future strangulation — was probably ""his attempt to 'make' Gabby calm down or 'make' her shut up.""""Although the act of grabbing someone’s face, like in this case, rarely causes any significant injury, I find that the specific act of grabbing someone’s face is extremely personal, violent, and controlling,"" Ratcliffe said. ""Just because there may have been some signs that Brian was the long-term predominant aggressor, law enforcement could only act on the information they were provided.""Based on his review of the body-worn camera footage, incident reports, and interviews with Pratt, Robbins, and Assistant Moab Police Chief Braydon Palmer, Ratcliffe said Petito was determined to be ""the predominant aggressor"" in this incident. Petito told the officers that she and Laundrie had been arguing all morning; when she saw the sirens as police tried to pull them over, she hit Laundrie to get his attention, causing the car to swerve.Ratcliffe explained that her statements along with what Laundrie and another witness told police ""would lead the officers to believe that Brian was acting in self-defense."" However, he noted that officers failed to further investigate the complaint Petito made about Laundrie grabbing her face, causing a scratch on her cheek.The officers in this incident had probable cause to arrest Petito, according to the report. But they misinterpreted the state's statute on assault as requiring intent when that was not necessary. They also miscategorized the incident as ""disorderly conduct"" when it should have been recorded as a domestic violence incident, Ratcliffe said. Advertisement     ""Despite knowing the history of those involved, we have had to make a decision based on the information presented to law enforcement at the time, despite our personal feelings and the known history of the relationship,"" he wrote.While it's clear the officers made several mistakes in their interactions with Petito and Laundrie, Ratcliffe concluded that it was unclear whether any of their missteps ultimately contributed to her death.""Would Gabby be alive today if this case was handled differently? That is an impossible question to answer despite it being the answer many people want to know,"" he wrote. ""Nobody knows and nobody will ever know the answer to that question.""

124,Teens from Brooklyn Technical High School and Stuyvesant High School organized the walkout after they grew concerned with New York’s rising COVID numbers over winter break.,"


Hundreds of New York City teenagers at dozens of public high schools walked out of class on Tuesday in protest of the city requirement that students must attend school in person.“Students have to juggle this decision of whether to come to school to pursue their education or to stay home and keep themselves and their families safe,” Rommy Sasson, a junior at Brooklyn Tech and one of the five walkout organizers, told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement     
 


“It’s to show that we’ve had enough,” said Dora Chan, a 17-year-old senior at Brooklyn Tech and another organizer.Teens from Brooklyn Technical High School and Stuyvesant High School, among the city’s top selective public schools, organized the walkout after they grew concerned with New York’s rising COVID numbers over winter break and were frustrated that they cannot do remote learning. Organizer Cruz Warshaw, a junior at Stuyvesant, estimated that more than 30 city schools had students walk out at 11:52 a.m., which is at the end of fifth period at Brooklyn Tech.
 


New York City began its extreme COVID surge in December due to the Omicron variant, and on Monday, the city reported 35,371 new COVID cases. Not only are cases rising, but people are also having a hard time finding rapid and PCR tests. Yet, Eric Adams, mayor of New York City, said Sunday that schools must remain open. ""I believe we're doing the right thing for our children, having them in the safest place, and that is in the school building,"" he told Face the Nation.But high school students disagree about just how safe school is for them — particularly when many live with older relatives or unvaccinated younger siblings. Chan, who lives with her grandparents, is so fearful about making them ill that she’s missed school for the past week.“If I were to get COVID and come back home to my grandparents, who are at risk, I don’t even want to say it,” Chan said. “We all know that COVID could result in death, and so it’s a really, really bleak reality that all New York City students are facing today.”Students returned after winter break just last week, but the teens told BuzzFeed News that school didn’t feel normal — teachers and students were absent due to sickness or fear of getting sick, and classrooms felt empty and tense.“The atmosphere at school has been much more of defeat and worry these past few days,” Sasson said. “That has been weighing on everyone’s mental health.”Online school is no longer available to New York City students, as a citywide policy.
 


For Rifah Saba, a junior at Stuyvesant High School, she said it’s “disheartening” to know government officials don’t value students’ health and safety. Saba called lunchtime at her school “appalling.”“The cafeteria is the biggest, most appalling COVID regulation violation you could see because it’s people in close contact, people with their masks down huddled together in a group,” she said.In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Sarah Casasnovas, the deputy press secretary for NYC schools, said the city’s Department of Education supports the “civic engagement” from the students.“Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our school communities, and we’ve doubled in-school testing and deployed 5 million rapid tests to quickly identify cases, stop transmission, and safely keep schools open,” the statement read. “Student voice is key and we’ll continue to listen to and work closely with those most impacted by our decisions — our students.” Advertisement     The walkout had an immediate effect: The organizers are meeting with Chancellor David C. Banks on Wednesday to discuss ideas and concerns.These students have already gone through one school year doing remote learning, so they understand it’s not ideal. Chan said her learning suffered because of it. But because cases are so high right now, these students believe it’s the only safe option.“It’s scary,” Chan said. “I really, really think the city needs to understand this. The students know remote learning is bad. Teachers know it’s bad too. But we’re saying that yes, but still because of public safety. Public safety needs to come first when we’re in this circumstance.”Chan said that the walkout faced criticism on Twitter, mainly from older people, but she wants to stress that the students who walked out risked getting in trouble. Also, older people might not understand what it’s like because they aren’t going to high school during a global pandemic.“When we see hundreds and hundreds of students taking this risk and not knowing if it would actually work out, it shows something about this generation,” Chan said. “We all collectively are united on this sentiment that schools need to shut down now.”

125,Omicron appears to be the mildest widespread COVID variant so far. Here's why it risks pushing the US hospital system to the brink.,"


The paradox of Omicron, now responsible for an estimated 98.3% of all US coronavirus cases, is that while it seems more likely to result in significantly milder outcomes than Delta and previous variants, the health system is as stressed as it’s ever been.Public health officials are warning that Omicron is threatening to overwhelm the medical infrastructure with sheer numbers, and hospitals are filled with seriously ill patients.“It's going to get worse before it gets better,” said Dean Blumberg, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the University of California, Davis.Here’s what we know about why this is happening:Omicron is more contagiousThe variant appears to be roughly two to five times more transmissible than Delta, which previously dominated US cases.“This is the second-most contagious disease in the world now, second to measles,” said Sara Murray, the director of the health informatics data science and innovation team and an associate professor of clinical and hospital medicine at the University of California San Francisco. Advertisement     “While we are seeing early evidence that Omicron is less severe than Delta and that those infected are less likely to require hospitalization, it's important to note that Omicron continues to be much more transmissible,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said on Wednesday.This means that even though a smaller percentage of patients infected with Omicron require hospitalization, the total number of COVID cases is so high that hospitals are seeing more of those patients than at any point in the pandemic.COVID-19 cases have reached record levels in the US, averaging around 1.4 million new reported cases a day, itself an undercount. Daily, an average of 19,800 people nationwide are now admitted to hospitals with COVID, according to the CDC, a 33% increase over the past week. Almost a third of intensive care unit beds nationwide are now filled with COVID patients, meaning roughly 1 out of every 2.5 people in an ICU ward in the country has the virus
 


More patients are being admitted “with” COVIDCOVID is so widespread right now that a significant percentage of hospitalized patients are admitted for something else but then test positive upon screening at admittance.“We test a lot of asymptomatic patients in preparation for procedures or surgeries, planned hospitalizations — and even in those folks who are totally asymptomatic, we're seeing a case positivity right now of about 12%,” Murray said.“It’s a very different landscape that we're seeing with overcrowding in the hospital than we've seen with the prior waves of COVID,” said Richelle Charles, an infectious disease expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. “Almost half of these cases are in the hospital for non-COVID-related illnesses.” Advertisement     At UCSF, Murray said overall about two-thirds of their COVID patients were hospitalized for the disease, while one-third were hospitalized with it. In pediatric COVID patients, about half of them were admitted for something other than the disease.Yet even if these patients' COVID symptoms are mild or nonexistent, their positive status places an extra burden on the hospital because they require isolation and extra safety protocols for hospital staff.Staffing shortages from exposure and burnoutHidden in the increasing case numbers are doctors, nurses, and other healthcare personnel infected by the more contagious variant, which causes more breakthrough infections among the vaccinated than past ones, said Akin Demehin, the policy director at the American Hospital Association. Even with mild infections, those healthcare workers are still out of action for a week after their tests turn negative, per CDC policy, just as the surge fills up hospitals and drives up demand for staff.The Omicron surge will only put more stress on doctors and nurses, who still have to care for all those extra patients. One survey last August reported that nearly 60% of doctors feel burned out, Demehin said, and that was two surges ago. “We hear this from hospital leaders all the time — their number one, two, and three priority right now is workforce,” he said. “They know just how much has been asked of healthcare providers over the past almost two years.”More young children“This time around, we're seeing more children less than 5 years of age,” Blumberg said.He has observed that many of them have milder cases of bronchitis or croup, whereas the teens with COVID seen in earlier surges had more severe pneumonia. Most of these young children recover well, but he cautioned that with any infection and any hospital admission, “some children aren't going to do well.”Hospitalizations among young children are currently higher than they’ve ever been during the pandemic, according to the CDC.Vaccines still work, but boosters are importantOne thing the Omicron surge hasn’t altered is the well-established reality that vaccines significantly improve people's odds of not dying from COVID-19. Deaths are still on the increase, averaging 1,600 a day in the US, an increase of 40% from the past week, according to the CDC. (Walensky said at the White House briefing that she thinks most of those are Delta variant cases.) Advertisement     With Omicron rampant, “virtually everybody is going to wind up getting exposed and likely get infected,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony Fauci said on Wednesday. “But if you're vaccinated, and if you're boosted, the chances of you getting sick are very, very low.”“At my hospital, we have a graphic that's sent out every day that has little people icons, those in the ICU, those on a ventilator, and those admitted for COVID. And the vast majority, overwhelmingly, are unvaccinated people in all three categories,” said Jeanne Marrazzo, the director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, who spoke Tuesday at an Infectious Diseases Society of America briefing on Omicron for reporters.“What we've learned with Omicron is that the booster really makes a big difference in terms of reducing your risk,” Murray said. Her hospital is seeing both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients hospitalized for COVID. But even patients who only had an initial series of vaccines — no booster — appear to be protected from the most severe outcomes.“What we aren't seeing is patients ending up on ventilators if they're fully vaccinated,” she said. “I don't have a single fully vaccinated patient in the hospital on a ventilator right now.”

126,The cruel irony is that what appears to be the mildest widespread variant of the coronavirus is the one that risks pushing the US hospital system to the brink.,"


In Chicago, patients are being treated in hospital hallways and in office chairs.In Farmington, New Mexico, military reinforcements have been deployed in civilian hospitals from over 700 miles away in San Diego.And in Paterson, New Jersey, nonemergency surgeries have been canceled. A gallbladder condition that might typically require removal? Try antibiotics first. A bone fracture for which you might normally go under the knife? Let’s put you in a cast and crutches for a bit to see how you fare. Advertisement     “You don’t really have to invoke crisis standards of care to be delivering crisis standards of care,” said Anand Swaminathan, assistant professor of emergency medicine at Paterson’s St. Joseph's University Medical Center. “It’s an enormous challenge to render care to as many patients as we can right now.”This is America in the Omicron wave. US hospitals and their staff are currently being tested in new and challenging ways that are unlike previous surges in the pandemic, medical workers across the country told BuzzFeed News. Patients who might normally be admitted for observation are being sent home to keep beds available. Others are waiting 10 hours or more in emergency rooms to be seen, before perhaps giving up and walking out altogether.Reaching the breaking point is a deceptively slow process, but little by little Swaminathan said his hospital and others are losing the things they need to keep running effectively. “This collapse is not going to be like an armageddon. It’s not going to happen all at once,” he said. “It’s going to be fairly silent, and people aren’t going to realize it until they call 911 and no one comes.”As Omicron spreads, COVID cases are surging at record levels in all 50 states. But given the relative mildness of the variant for most people, especially the vaccinated, Anthony Fauci and others have said it is now more relevant to pay closer attention to hospitalization data than total case numbers. Yet, that too is alarming. More than 147,000 people are currently in US hospitals with COVID — more than at any point in the pandemic to date. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday that the seven-day average of hospital admissions had risen 33% over the prior week to about 19,800 per day.
 


Importantly, those figures include people with an incidental case of COVID, meaning they came to be treated for something else and were found to also be positive for the virus. But while that may sound less worrying, it can be deceiving. COVID may be exacerbating some people’s underlying health issues and, crucially, the net effect on hospitals is the same: more patients taking up more beds and requiring special isolation and safety protocols so as not to infect others. Advertisement     While new studies are showing Omicron is less severe and requires hospital stays about 70% shorter than Delta on average, the incredibly transmissible variant is still spreading like wildfire, including among children, who are being admitted to hospitals with COVID at record rates. “The risk of hospitalization remains low, especially among people who are up to date on their COVID vaccines,” Walensky said Wednesday. “However, the staggering rise in cases — over 1 million new cases each day — has led to a high number of total hospitalizations.”All this while more and more medical workers are themselves testing positive and being forced to the sidelines, leaving their colleagues — at least, those who haven’t left the profession altogether due to burnout — straining to treat the patients turning up in droves in their emergency rooms with COVID, yes, but also for any other medical condition or traumatic injury.The cruel irony, then, is that what appears to be the mildest widespread variant of the coronavirus is the one that risks toppling the US hospital system.“Before this if you had an acute life- or limb-threatening medical issue and you went to an emergency department in America, you would have a promise that it would be quickly taken care of,” said Gabe Gao, an ER physician at St. Luke's Hospital in New Bedford, Massachusetts. “I don’t think we can keep that promise right now.”
 


Not every hospital is currently facing a crunch. Some that previously experienced huge waves are holding steady — for now. “In the first wave, I had 400 patients with COVID, now we have 100,” said Aaron Glatt, chair of the department of medicine at Mount Sinai South Nassau on Long Island, New York. “We have better treatments, we have a better understanding of the virus, but at the same time, two months ago I had 10 patients with COVID.” Advertisement     Michael Daignault, an ER doctor at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, said he was so shaken by the surge of cases in his area last winter that he felt the current moment was more manageable. Before patients might stay for weeks or months at a time in the ICU, but now that tends to be different. “The majority of patients that are getting admitted have less severe illness. The average length of stay has gone down,” he said. “It’s a quicker turnover. We’re able to handle it.”But both Daignault and Glatt said they had still experienced staffing shortages, with hospital workers out sick from the virus. They also noted they live in states with relatively high vaccination rates. New York, for example, has almost 20% more people fully vaccinated than in Missouri, where total hospitalizations are now above their worst previous levels.“Missouri’s hospitals are slammed,” Missouri Hospital Association spokesperson Dave Dillon said. “Hospitals are delaying non-emergent care, boarding patients of all kinds in emergency departments for a lack of bed space, and experiencing significant workforce challenges.”“Not sure what else to tell you. These are very difficult times,” he said.In Idaho, the state with the lowest vaccination rate where less than half the population is fully vaccinated, the Omicron surge could be disastrous. Many hospitals there have only recently pulled themselves out of crisis standards of care following an overwhelming surge of Delta cases in September. Susie Keller, the CEO of the Idaho Medical Association, said her members have barely caught their breath from that trauma and are now staring down the likely prospect of another wave. “They just feel completely besieged,” she said. “It’s another thing on top of everything else.”Keller implored those in her state who have not received a vaccine to do so, lest they take up a hospital bed that could go to another person who has had their shots and comes to be treated for COVID or something else, only to discover medical assistance is in short supply. “It’s absolutely unfair, and it’s a very sad situation,” she said. “My heart truly goes out to those folks who are trying to do the right thing and for circumstances beyond their control end up in a hospital where the resources aren’t there.” Advertisement     
 


There are signs that some places hit early by Omicron have seen the worst of their spike in infections, although hospitalizations have previously tended to lag case counts by about two weeks.But other states are still yet to reach their Omicron peak, including Arizona, where in a press briefing on Tuesday, Marjorie Bessel, the chief clinical officer at the Phoenix-headquartered Banner Health, which employs over 50,000 people across the American West, pleaded with people to be patient with staff in the days and weeks ahead. More employees are calling out sick, she said, meaning patients are experiencing longer waits than normal.“We are busy in our clinics, we are busy in our urgent cares, we're busy in our emergency departments, and we are busy in our hospitals,” Bessel said. “We also understand that we are not yet at the peak of the Omicron variant.”In an effort to reduce the total number of medical staffers out sick at any one point, the CDC announced just before Christmas that asymptomatic medical workers could return to work after seven days, instead of 10, if they test negative. Medical staff who have received their booster shots also now no longer need to self-quarantine at home following high-risk exposures.One ER physician in Manhattan, who asked not to be named in order to speak freely about conditions at his hospital, said that this change in CDC policy had lessened nursing shortages at his facility, but he noted doctors were still often performing nursing tasks, such as administering IVs or discharging patients. Advertisement     “There are obviously concerns,” he added. “I think there’s still not great evidence about how long you’re contagious, and I think it’s a rule made out of understandable necessity because otherwise we wouldn’t have enough medical workers, but on an individual level it’s hard to reckon with the idea of coming back and potentially infecting other staff members.”Across the city in Brooklyn, another ER doctor not authorized to speak with the media said she too was having to take on more tasks usually carried out by nurses or patient care technicians, in addition to her own work. She’s only been a working doctor for a year and a half, but the staffing crunch has her feeling more overwhelmed than ever. “Sometimes it’s just so busy you don’t even have time to think or have emotions about what’s going on,” she said, “but after your shift ends, then it kind of hits you, this wave of exhaustion.”Gao, the Massachusetts doctor, said he’s noticed classic symptoms of burnout in himself and other colleagues. When he walks into work on a Monday morning and sees 35 or 40 admitted patients taking up beds in the emergency department and another 20 to 30 in the waiting room, he knows he’s in for yet another rough week. It takes a certain mental and physical resiliency to choose to work in the ER, but he worries he’s already been broken by it.“It’s terrible. It’s awful. It’s the moral injury of all this,” Gao said. “Healthcare should not function on the backs of beleaguered emergency workers that are trying to find the smallest nook and cranny to fit someone into, and that person’s healthcare should not be hanging by a thread as a result of those efforts.”Peter Aldhous and Dan Vergano contributed reporting to this story.

127,"Eight children were among those killed, and some families lost multiple loved ones.","


The fire in a Bronx apartment building on Sunday was one of the city's deadliest in decades, leaving 17 people dead from smoke inhalation and devastating a close-knit community.As their identities were made public this week, so were their stories. Eight children were among those killed, and some families had multiple loved ones die. Officials said the victims were largely Gambian immigrants, some of whom worshipped at the same mosques and even emigrated from the same town. Advertisement     The two youngest victims were Ousmane Konteh, a 2-year-old boy, and Haouwa Mahamadou, a 5-year-old girl. Her brother, 12-year-old Seydou Toure, also perished. He had attended eighth grade next door at Angelo Patri Middle School, the New York Times reported. His classmates have been mourning the loss together, writing messages on a memorial poster, lighting prayer candles, and wearing badges with Seydou's photo.“I loved him dearly,” said the school's principal, Angel Ortega. “He always had that smile.""Two other siblings remained in critical condition, with organizers also setting up a GoFundMe for their recovery effort.Five of the victims were from the same family. They were Haja Dukureh, 37, her husband, Haji Dukuray, 49, and their three children, Mustapha, 12, Mariam, 11, and Fatoumata, 5, the woman's uncle told the New York Post. Advertisement     The uncle, whose name is also Haji Dukuray, said he had many relatives living in the building and would regularly drive there from his home in Delaware to visit. “We have faith, so we’re holding onto our faith,” Dukuray said. “We are hanging in there as much as we can. We’re supporting each other.”The couple emigrated from Gambia over a decade ago, and all three children were born in the US, another relative, 21-year-old Hawa Dukuray, told the New York Times. The mother worked as a home health aide, and the father at a fried chicken restaurant, saving money they hoped to send back to Gambia. Living high up on the 19th floor — and without an outdoor fire escape — the family tried taking the stairs to escape the burning building, but did not make it out in time, the relative said.The family, like many of the others whose loved ones died in the fire, has a GoFundMe page set up by a relative to help cover funerals and other costs.Another family lost four loved ones in the fire: Fatoumata Drammeh, 50, Foutmala Drammeh, 21, Nyumaaisha Drammeh, 19, and Muhammed Drammeh, 12.Ishak Drammeh, 57, was not home at the time of the fire that killed his wife and children. Foutmala had been studying international economics and was about to graduate college, he told the New York Times.“She was a very good girl,” he said. “Muhammad was a good boy too. Nyumaaisha was a good girl, she finished her high school; next month she is supposed to start her college.”Just one day before the fire, Muhammed had celebrated his 12th birthday at an indoor trampoline park. The last time Fatima, the surviving sister, saw her mother and one of her young sisters was in their apartment before her brother's party, she said.“I just said bye to them, because we were leaving the house,” she said. “I didn’t think it would be my last time seeing them.”Just one member of the family, 16-year-old Yagub, made it out of the fire alive. He ""was the only one rescued from the building and is currently being cared for in the hospital,"" according to a GoFundMe for the family set up by their cousin Nhuma Darame. Advertisement     
 


The Gambian Youth Organization (GYO), a Bronx-based nonprofit supporting young members of the community, has already more than quintupled their fundraising goal, raising more than $1 million on GoFundMe to aid the victims' families.One of the organization's volunteers, Sera Janneh, 27, also died in the fire. Despite working multiple jobs, she was highly involved in GYO, its founder Momodou Sawaneh told Gothamist, describing her as an “industrial woman"" who had ""such a great life in front of her.""“When I talk about her, tears come out from my eyes,” Sawaneh said. ""We lost her for something that could have been prevented.""Janneh had been studying to become a social worker at Lehman College because she believed “we needed more of that in our community, especially in the African community,” her sister Mareama Janneh, 31, told the New York Times. Her younger sister ""is currently intubated with hopes of recovering from her injuries,"" she wrote on the family's GoFundMe.Sera's best friend, Breanna Elleston, 27, said they had loved visiting museums and attending concerts together since they first met in high school.“Every milestone that I’ve ever had in my life, she’s always been there for me,” Elleston said. “Even if it was hard, she would drop everything and be there for me.”Not all the victims were residents of the building; Fatoumata Tunkara, 43, and her 6-year-old son, Omar Jambang, had been there to visit a friend. Tunkara leaves behind four children, according to a GoFundMe set up by a relative. Advertisement     Tunkara's eldest son, Abdullaie Chan, 19, told the New York Daily News he called his mother ""more than 40 times"" when he heard about the fire.“I knew she was in that building, but I thought she got out in time,” Chan said. “She didn’t pick up the phone... I feel like she was not supposed to be there.”Also among the deceased were Isatou Jabbie, 31, and Hagi Jawara, 47. They were the parents of four children, according to two GoFundMe pages.Hagi Jawara was from Sierra Leone and came to the US as a refugee in the 1990s, his brother, Yusupha Jawara, told the Associated Press. It was there that he met Isatou Jabbine, a Gambian woman living in the Bronx, who he later married.When Yusupha, who lives nearby, heard about the fire, he hurried there to help bring victims to the hospital. As the hours went by without the couple answering their phones, Yusupha grew increasingly worried. He later realized a man he'd seen on a gurney had been his brother.“I was just helping the EMS transport one person to the hospital when I saw him — somebody similar like him — on a stretcher being brought to the ER,” he said. “At that time, I didn’t have the focus to know that it was him.”

Mike Kamber has had many, many lives. The founder and executive director of the Bronx Documentary Center worked as a documentary photographer for over two decades, and his work has twice been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. He lived in the Bronx for a period in the 1980s and dreamed of making an educational space that would bring arts and education to the South Bronx. Founded in 2011, the Bronx Documentary Center is a nonprofit organization and mecca for photography lovers.We asked Kamber about the photographers and images that have influenced him over his lengthy career. One of the photographs that influenced him was taken by his friend Tim Hetherington, who died in Libya in 2011 and with whom he’d discussed starting a photo nonprofit. Kamber’s mother, also a photographer who lives in Maine, was one of his early inspirations.Here are just a few of the photographers and works that inspire Kamber. Advertisement  
 


I was born in 1963, and my first memories photographically are images from Vietnam. Larry Burrows was easily the greatest color photographer of that generation, and his photos were the ones that affected me first — I saw them in Life magazine. And Burrows’ photos of war are not heroic — no war photo should ever be heroic. Yet Burrows’ photo here of a wounded soldier reaching out to help another wounded soldier lying on the ground is biblical in scope and brilliant in composition. It gives you a sense of the quagmire that was the Vietnam War.Burrows was shooting Kodachrome with a Leica M4: no light meter, extremely difficult to get the light right, and no room for error. And yet Burrows’ use of light and color reminds me of Goya's paintings of war from hundreds of years earlier. To me, this is just an epic, sad, and futile photo of war — but also says something about brotherhood and sacrifice. Larry Burrows was killed alongside Henri Huet, another of my favorite photographers, when their helicopter was shot down in 1971.
 


My mother, Hannah Kamber, took this picture in 1969 at Pineland, a notorious facility for the developmentally disabled up in Maine, the state where I grew up. She worked briefly as a photographer for the Maine Times shooting in the 1960s and covering important social issues — or at least issues that were important to her. The Maine Times was an alternative newspaper — they were sprouting up across the country then and usually focused on investigations and providing a counterpoint to the mainstream press. And the Maine Times gave my mother freedom to go out and do what she wanted. She talked her way into Pineland somehow. As she told it, there was someone on the inside who wanted to see real change. And she photographed people chained to the floor in pools of urine, filthy and forgotten. The state of Maine started an investigation based on her photos and changed the laws regarding the treatment of our special needs population. This photo showed me that photojournalism could make a real difference in people’s lives.
 


This photo by Danny Lyon was from his Bikeriders series. Danny's photos were important to me because when he immersed himself, he went all the way. His photos from the civil rights movement were from the inside, not the outside. When he did his prison book, Conversations with the Dead, he spent months inside the prison, in the subblocks, and actually printed copies of the book clandestinely in the prison workshop. In this photo, he was in deep with the Chicago outlaws as a member of the motorcycle gang, and his photos show an intimacy that no visiting photographer can touch. Danny is also a master of composition and movement and light and knows when to leave space around a photograph. But I've learned a lot, looking at his photos. Him and Robert Frank. Of course, from Danny, I learned that you had to commit all the way, that you couldn't come in and do a toe touch for an hour or a day and then escape back to your comfortable life. If you're committed, you went all the way.
 


This photo is by my friend Tim Hetherington, who was killed in 2011, and his death pushed me to start the Bronx Documentary Center, which he really helped plan out. We talked about a nonprofit like this for a couple of years. And when Tim was killed in the civil war in Libya, a group of friends came together and helped me get the BDC going.I guess you could call him a war photographer, but he was never interested in pictures of people shooting guns, and in that way he was like Larry Burrows and Henri Huet. He was always looking for something that showed how the wars were fought on the backs of civilians. Tim studied the classics and knew the Homeric wars, chapter and verse. He saw conflict as a modern tragedy, a sort of farce, that leaders played out, destroying the lives of men, women, and children along the way. I always loved this photo because it showed what war had done to the Liberian economy. It was once one of the fastest growing in West Africa. And by the time Tim and I got there in 2003, the country was in complete shambles. There'd been no electricity or running water for years, but we were lucky enough to finally come to the country.
 


I took this photo on an early morning raid in Balad, Iraq, in 2003, as the Iraq War was just ramping up. The New York Times had sent me in. In September, we all thought combat operations were over — little did we know, I was just getting started, went out with some soldiers from the Fourth Infantry Division. They were getting ambushed daily and starting to lose soldiers. They responded with early morning raids, smashing down doors, dragging men out of bed so they [could] search for weapons, and I saw these girls getting ready to go off to school as a Bradley fighting vehicle rumbled by, waited, and grabbed the photo. It's a photo that has always struck people. I think it's simply the juxtaposition. It might be a bit cliched, but it's real. We're fighting this war in people's front yards. And that's why hundreds of thousands of Iraqis are dead as a result.
 


I took this photo in Iraq in 2007, [which] was the bloodiest year of the war. I went with Damien and Diana Cave, a husband and wife who are also a reporter and videographer, into the Sunni triangle to do a story on some American soldiers who had been ambushed and kidnapped. They eventually turned up dead. As American soldiers went out to search for them, they also were being ambushed and killed. We went out before dawn with the 10th Mountain Division, and as we walked down trails through the countryside and the sun began to creep up over the horizon, I stepped over a landmine [that] had been buried in the trail and a guy behind me stepped on it and was killed instantly. A number of others were wounded, and I helped bandage them as I photographed. The Pentagon tried to stop publication of these photos. I actually had a bizarre phone call with a colonel in Washington, DC, who kept coming up with new reasons why I couldn't publish these photos. The New York Times backed me, and we published them anyway. When Damien Cave went back to see the unit, a year or two later, they called him into a conference room. He went in with some trepidation, afraid of what might happen. Instead, the soldiers thanked him profusely for telling Americans back home what the war was really like and showing people their sacrifices.
 


This photo is important to me because it's one of the first ones I ever took that really showed environmental devastation happening on this planet. In the States, the big corporations are very sophisticated, and they know how to hide the damage that they're doing. But when you go to Africa, it's just right there. They think no one is paying attention. I took this photo in Nigeria, in 2005, before there were really cell phone cameras around. The New York Times ran it on the front page. It served as a small piece of evidence of how several petroleum companies continue to flare gas to the present day and it is one of West Africa's major contributors to pollution and climate change.This picture shows young children playing at night in their village, which is bisected by massive pipelines and gas players. Gas is a byproduct of the company's drilling for oil. And they burn off millions and millions of cubic feet of it, destroying the environment and warming the planet.
 


I took this picture in the South Bronx in 1988; I believe there was a building full of artists who are squatting in an abandoned building around the corner from where I lived on Willis Avenue, got to know them, and began to photograph their struggle, as the city started to evict them. In this photo the squatters are stringing barbed wire to keep city marshals from entering the building and evicting them. I was relatively young; I was still working construction and learning to photograph at night and on the weekends. I learned the importance of finding a good story with good visuals and access, to tell the story of what people were going through and get at the larger social issues around poverty, race, and class that were dividing America then, and are dividing America even more so now.
 


This photo is by Trevon Blondet — he’s part of a group of Bronx photographers that I’ve been helping to train for quite a few years. Trevon has really taken to shooting black and white film with an old Hasselblad camera, and he’s great with people and has a real instinct for a good photo. He’s been doing portraits in a Bronx housing project where he once grew up, and I love everything about this photo: the composition, light, and feeling of a confident young man trying to move into adulthood on a hot summer afternoon in the South Bronx. And of course it’s incredibly rewarding to see a student like Trevon take what you show him and then surpass you.
 


This photo is by Johis Alarcón, and she’s been part of our Latin American Photo Festival that we put on every year here in the Bronx. Johis has been working on all kinds of social, humanitarian, and gender issues in Ecuador as well as documenting indigenous religious and cultural practices throughout the country. She really connects with people and has a wonderful sense of color, movement, and emotion in her photos. In her work, there is also a sense of trying to capture something that is threatened, that may not last, and that has to be seen and remembered. There is a tremendous documentary photography movement happening throughout South and Central America, most of it based on photo collectives, and Johis is part of that movement.
 


I’ve worked with Stephanie Sinclair going back to the Iraq War, and we’ve exhibited her Too Young To Wed project at the Bronx Documentary Center, where it made an enormous impact on the community. Stephanie has been working on this project for a decade in dozens of countries. This photo is from Yemen, where Stephanie documented a tradition of young girls being married off to older men. For me, this photo really brings home the exploitation of young girls all over the world as they are forced into various kinds of subjugation. It varies by region and culture, but it’s happening everywhere. Too Young to Wed has been shown around the globe and — in the best tradition of photojournalism and documentary photography — brought major attention to this issue.

130,"In the second season of Netflix’s Cheer, we see an even uglier side of the sport.","


When the first season of the Netflix docuseries Cheer debuted in January 2020, it was a commercial and critical hit. The show, about a group of cheerleaders at Navarro Junior College in Corsicana, Texas, and their coach, Monica Aldama, put the tremendous hard work and athleticism of cheerleaders on full display.But while the show challenged people’s perceptions of how much effort goes into cheerleading, it also veered into precarious myths of toxic positivity, with its emphasis on young people sacrificing their bodies for the sake of the team. And most jarring of all was the October 2020 arrest of fan-favorite Jerry Harris for alleged sexual assault. Advertisement     Given this context, it’s surprising that the series’ creator and executive producer, Greg Whiteley, opted to do a second season of the show. “I am a huge believer in the power of stories and telling them honestly,” Whiteley said this past December when it was announced that the show would be returning. “I believe the story is going to ultimately be the best version of itself when you are honoring what is true, and you’re not running from it.” The second season, out today, is evenly split between the Navarro College cheerleaders and their rivals, the underdogs at Trinity Valley College, who reside about 45 minutes down the road in Athens, Texas, and are coached by Javontae Johnson.While the dramatic stakes are compelling and we see the return of familiar faces — including the self-assured La’Darius Marshall; the tumbler Lexi Brumback, who appears to be enjoying the various income opportunities of fame; and the all-star Gabi Butler — there’s a sense of unease that permeates the season because of the real-life criminal charges against Harris, who appears throughout the first half of the season. Harris, 22, was charged with one count of producing child sexual abuse images and for allegedly soliciting nudes from minors in October 2020; he was hit with subsequent charges just months later. (Harris denied the accusations in a statement to ABC News in September 2020, but when questioned by authorities he allegedly admitted to sexually assaulting a 15-year-old in 2019. He has been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago since his arrest in September 2020 and no trial date has been set.)One episode halfway through the season, titled “Jerry,” is solely about the allegations and includes on-camera interviews with the victims of his alleged abuse and their mother. Harris’s former teammates frequently express shock, saying they never would have guessed he could commit such crimes.But given how the show depicts competitive cheerleading, it’s not hard to imagine how this sort of behavior would have flown under the radar. Aldama and her assistant coaches are frequently dismissive of the athletes' feelings. When cheerleaders who train hard for months only to not make mat (qualifying for the team that will perform at finals) are reasonably disappointed, Aldama is quick to shut down their chatter from the sidelines because they’re “being so negative,” as she says in one episode. The culture of toxic positivity, of always needing to put on a brave or smiling face and perfect their routine for the sake of the team, could make athletes feel uncomfortable speaking up about abuse. Advertisement     In the episode addressing the impact of Harris’s allegations on the lives of his former teammates, a Good Morning America clip plays. Aldama appears on a video call with the other contestants joining her for Season 29 of Dancing With the Stars. Meant to be a surprise, the morning show’s host cuts to Harris, who appears onscreen, hyping his coach up with his high-pitched voice and infectious enthusiasm. “Congratulations, Monica!” Harris screeches. “I’m so, so happy for you. I can’t wait to vote for you every week.” The former cheerleader’s spirited disposition is disarming, and from the many clips shown, this is pretty much the only side we see of him, save for the instances where he discusses his difficult upbringing.While it might be tough for some to imagine how a person with such a seemingly bright personality could be the source of pain for younger, more impressionable athletes participating in the sport, this dynamic is not uncommon when it comes to abuse. The episode where twin brothers Sam and Charlie tell their story explores how the public perception of Harris almost prevented them from coming forward. “[Harris] messaged me on my private Instagram account on his private Instagram account and like basically just saying, ‘Hey,’ and he asked how old I was,” Charlie says in the episode, recounting an incident that he says occurred during his first cheerleading season in December 2018. “And I told him that I was 13 and then after that, right off the bat, he asked me, ‘Can I have butt pics?’” At the time, Harris was 19.The episode captures how difficult it can be for sexual assault victims, especially minors, to speak out. Charlie and Sam knew of Harris long before he started messaging them on Snapchat because he was a rising star on one of their favorite cheer teams. They didn’t want to tell their story, at least at first, because it meant they would be ostracized by their peers, people who looked up to Harris. “It made me lose even more faith, I guess, in like just having a safe community in cheer,” Sam said, right after his brother said Harris cornered him in a bathroom during a practice event, demanding sex. Even after being charged with these crimes, Harris still exudes a puzzling optimism. His lawyers, according to Netflix, declined to be interviewed on camera, but Aldama said Harris wrote her a letter saying one day he hoped to become a motivational speaker. If convicted, Harris faces a minimum 15-year prison sentence.Throughout this season, it feels like Cheer is trying to toe the line between telling hard, uncomfortable truths about the sport of competitive cheerleading while also being inspirational television. In Season 1, you could actively applaud the Navarro team and its dedication to the sport, looking past the injuries the athletes sustained and the broken homes they escaped to make their dreams a reality. But Season 2, which was shot in 2020 and 2021, before and then during the pandemic, it feels icky to witness. Advertisement     Observing the young cheerleaders push past their breaking point and, even worse, seeing how the coaches poorly handle their emotions when it comes to the athletes’ needs illuminates the overwhelming stress of the sport. “So TT’s out until next Tuesday,” Aldama says in Episode 3’s “Dracut Girl,” referring to a stunter, visibly annoyed by the delays this will cause for the team’s tight practice schedule. “Seems extreme,” she says, right before briefly walking outside of the gym because she needed a “new attitude.” TT’s exact ailment isn’t addressed, but there’s an acknowledgment that he has had “headaches.” That Aldama doesn’t seem sympathetic to his pain is concerning.Understandably, no one handles their emotions well every single time, and Aldama and the assistants are human like anyone else, but as the season continues, you begin to pick up on several instances where the leaders come across as cold and indifferent to various dilemmas pertaining to the cheerleaders. Even when it comes to the emotional needs of the cheerleaders, it often feels like the coaches don’t think about how their decisions impact players. There’s another scene in that same episode where newcomer Maddy is replaced in a stunt routine without a proper heads-up about the abrupt switch. Moments later, she breaks down crying. “How did I go from being center stunt to not being there at all?” she asks Aldama through tears. “I could’ve gotten, like, a warning before practice.” It doesn’t feel like the cheerleader’s concerns are adequately validated, as everything — even minor expressions of dissent — comes back to the needs of the team. “If we make a decision that I feel is best for the team, I need you to support that, all right?” Aldama says.While watching Cheer, you will undoubtedly marvel at the incredible stunts the athletes are able to pull off, and you’ll likely tear up when listening to some of the neophytes talk about their journey into the sport, as well as their hopes and dreams for after. But the darker side of cheer makes for tough viewing. As the pandemic continues, some athletes question whether it was worth it to leave their hometowns for the chance to train at Navarro. By the end of the season, some choose not to return. Cheer will likely be a hit for Netflix once again, but this time it’s harder to find anyone to root for. ●

131,How about that Euphoria/Marvel crossover?,"At long last, Season 2 of Euphoria is finally here. Over two years since its first season premiered, the hit HBO series, which stars Zendaya, finally returned to screens on Sunday with an action-packed first episode. And despite a generous serving of onscreen drama, a particular behind-the-scenes moment still managed to divert some of the attention. So, if you’ve watched the first episode already, you’ll know that Season 2 is set to welcome a number of new characters to the show’s star-studded ensemble. However, the addition of a few new faces didn't stop fans from doing a double-take after spotting an imposter in a newly surfaced snap of the cast. On Monday, photographer Siyon Foster celebrated the launch of Season 2 with a backstage photo dump, providing fans on Instagram with a selection of brand-new behind-the-scenes shots that look to have been taken while shooting episode one. Upon further inspection of the gallery, eagle-eyed viewers noticed an eerie figure lurking in the background of a group photograph, a familiar peace sign peeking out from behind Zendaya, who posed with her costars. In case you’ve not already guessed, fans collectively identified the silhouette as Zendaya’s boyfriend, Tom Holland, inevitably prompting a LOT of excitement on social media. Before we proceed, we must preface that the picture in question is pretty dark and grainy, making it nearly impossible to say for certain if it’s Tom, or just someone who resembles him. (Not to mention that he’s also wearing a mask, which — while praiseworthy — does not help with the investigation.) Nonetheless, I think we can pretty safely assume that the masked individual huddled behind Zendaya is probably who we think it is. Especially given that Tom recently revealed that he visited the set ""at least 30 times"" while they shot Season 2. If you know anything about Tom and Zendaya, that piece of information probably won’t come as a surprise to you, particularly in light of the fact that the Spider-Man star has made no secret of his desire to get involved with Euphoria. Stepping away from the Marvel Cinematic Universe for a moment, Tom explained during an interview in December that he had been “petitioning” for a role on the hit series. “It has not happened yet and I'm very disappointed,” he said at the time. “I want to be in Euphoria!” And given that Zendaya also serves as an executive producer on the show, the idea that she might be able to wrangle a cameo for her boyfriend doesn’t seem out of the question. However, despite his promising appearance behind the scenes, it sounds a lot like we might have to wait a bit longer to get the Marvel/Euphoria crossover we deserve. Addressing the cameo speculation during a conversation with E! News on Jan. 7, Zendaya hinted that she actually asked the show’s producers if they could work in an appearance for Tom. “I mean, listen, we've talked about it all the time,” she said. “We're like, ‘Let's just sneak him in the back of a shot or something!’” So, while it seems unlikely that we’ll be seeing Tom’s face in this season of Euphoria, we’ve certainly got our hopes up for the future. And besides, if there’s one thing to be learned from his recent performance in Spider-Man: No Way Home, it’s that Tom knows a thing or two about legendary crossovers. And we’ll leave it at that."
132,"Drew got super real about the false alarm as she reunited with her former costars ahead of Scream’s relaunch, and it turns out that it isn’t just Ghostface that gave her the heebie jeebies on set.","Unless you’ve been living under a rock lately, you’re probably aware that Ghostface is back in town for a brand-new installment of the horror movie franchise Scream. The new movie, which is set for release this week, has been described as “an absolute, brand-new relaunch of the franchise” by star Courteney Cox, who also appeared in the original 1996 movie. But its release has still served as an excuse for the OG cast to enjoy a reunion, with Courteney joining Neve Campbell, David Arquette, and Drew Barrymore for a candid chat on The Drew Barrymore Show this week. As the group discussed their experiences on set, Drew recalled having a pregnancy scare that left her “freaking out” — and how she turned to Courteney for help through it. Drew only briefly appeared in the movie but featured prominently in the promo leading up to its release, which gave her plenty of time to bond with her costar. Speaking to Courteney on the show, Drew reflected: “We became so close, Courteney. I remember at the poster shoot I was, like, having a nervous breakdown because I was having a false sense of being pregnant.” “I kept asking you, 'How do you know if you're pregnant? Like, I'm freaking out! We're supposed to shoot this poster but oh my god, I just started dating somebody! How do you know?’” Drew continued. “I felt safe going to you, like you were the mature, safe person in the room.” It turns out that Drew had no reason to panic because it was a false alarm, and the star didn't become a mom for another 16 years when she welcomed her daughter Olive with ex-husband Will Kopelman. While Drew may not have given us the first Scream child, Courteney and David reflected on how their daughter is a direct result of the franchise and how much the movie changed their lives in every possible way. Their daughter Coco was born in June 2004, with David telling Drew: “We had a daughter out of it and she's the greatest thing in my life. That really is the most impactful thing that has ever happened to me in this business.” Courteney echoed his sentiments, with the pair still on good terms despite calling it quits on their relationship in 2013. The Friends star also admitted that Scream had changed her life in a way that most fans can probably relate to, explaining: “I will not go to the bathroom in a movie theater or just about any sports arena.” And for that, I have to admit, I don’t blame her."

Hundreds of New York City teenagers at dozens of public high schools walked out of class on Tuesday in protest of the city requirement that students must attend school in person.“Students have to juggle this decision of whether to come to school to pursue their education or to stay home and keep themselves and their families safe,” Rommy Sasson, a junior at Brooklyn Tech and one of the five walkout organizers, told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement     
 


“It’s to show that we’ve had enough,” said Dora Chan, a 17-year-old senior at Brooklyn Tech and another organizer.Teens from Brooklyn Technical High School and Stuyvesant High School, among the city’s top selective public schools, organized the walkout after they grew concerned with New York’s rising COVID numbers over winter break and were frustrated that they cannot do remote learning. Organizer Cruz Warshaw, a junior at Stuyvesant, estimated that more than 30 city schools had students walk out at 11:52 a.m., which is at the end of fifth period at Brooklyn Tech.
 


New York City began its extreme COVID surge in December due to the Omicron variant, and on Monday, the city reported 35,371 new COVID cases. Not only are cases rising, but people are also having a hard time finding rapid and PCR tests. Yet, Eric Adams, mayor of New York City, said Sunday that schools must remain open. ""I believe we're doing the right thing for our children, having them in the safest place, and that is in the school building,"" he told Face the Nation.But high school students disagree about just how safe school is for them — particularly when many live with older relatives or unvaccinated younger siblings. Chan, who lives with her grandparents, is so fearful about making them ill that she’s missed school for the past week.“If I were to get COVID and come back home to my grandparents, who are at risk, I don’t even want to say it,” Chan said. “We all know that COVID could result in death, and so it’s a really, really bleak reality that all New York City students are facing today.”Students returned after winter break just last week, but the teens told BuzzFeed News that school didn’t feel normal — teachers and students were absent due to sickness or fear of getting sick, and classrooms felt empty and tense.“The atmosphere at school has been much more of defeat and worry these past few days,” Sasson said. “That has been weighing on everyone’s mental health.”Online school is no longer available to New York City students, as a citywide policy.
 


For Rifah Saba, a junior at Stuyvesant High School, she said it’s “disheartening” to know government officials don’t value students’ health and safety. Saba called lunchtime at her school “appalling.”“The cafeteria is the biggest, most appalling COVID regulation violation you could see because it’s people in close contact, people with their masks down huddled together in a group,” she said.In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Sarah Casasnovas, the deputy press secretary for NYC schools, said the city’s Department of Education supports the “civic engagement” from the students.“Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our school communities, and we’ve doubled in-school testing and deployed 5 million rapid tests to quickly identify cases, stop transmission, and safely keep schools open,” the statement read. “Student voice is key and we’ll continue to listen to and work closely with those most impacted by our decisions — our students.” Advertisement     The walkout had an immediate effect: The organizers are meeting with Chancellor David C. Banks on Wednesday to discuss ideas and concerns.These students have already gone through one school year doing remote learning, so they understand it’s not ideal. Chan said her learning suffered because of it. But because cases are so high right now, these students believe it’s the only safe option.“It’s scary,” Chan said. “I really, really think the city needs to understand this. The students know remote learning is bad. Teachers know it’s bad too. But we’re saying that yes, but still because of public safety. Public safety needs to come first when we’re in this circumstance.”Chan said that the walkout faced criticism on Twitter, mainly from older people, but she wants to stress that the students who walked out risked getting in trouble. Also, older people might not understand what it’s like because they aren’t going to high school during a global pandemic.“When we see hundreds and hundreds of students taking this risk and not knowing if it would actually work out, it shows something about this generation,” Chan said. “We all collectively are united on this sentiment that schools need to shut down now.”

134,Jennifer’s pledge came as Ben reflected on their “meaningful relationship” in a new interview. The pair rekindled their romance last year after initially dating in the early ’00s.,"In spring 2021, pop culture enthusiasts everywhere rejoiced as it was revealed that Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck had started dating again — almost 20 years after they broke up. Bennifer were initially a staple power couple of the ‘00s, dating for two years between 2002 and 2004 and even getting engaged before calling it quits. Over the next 17 years, the pair went their separate ways as they started families and found love with new partners. Jennifer married singer Marc Anthony in June 2004 — just five months after her split from Ben — and the pair welcomed twins before breaking up in 2011. She went on to have relationships with dancer Casper Smart, and New York Yankees baseball player Alex Rodriguez (below). Meanwhile, Ben shares three children with ex-wife Jennifer Garner, who he was married to between 2005 and 2018. After their breakup, he dated actor Ana de Armas. But in living proof that true love will always find a way, the former couple reconnected in 2021; first romantically linked in April before Jennifer publicly confirmed their romance in July. The pair have been relatively low-key about their reunion, but made their red carpet debut at Venice Film Festival in September in support of Ben’s movie The Last Duel, before attending the Met Gala together just days later. And in December, Ben spoke candidly about his decision to get back with Jennifer, admitting that he was initially hesitant to take the plunge due to the toll the media scrutiny could take on his children. During an interview with Howard Stern, Ben was asked: “Was there hesitation on your part, because now you’re a dad? Was there hesitation on your part to say, you know, 'I can’t go through this again'?” Ben replied: “It crossed my mind for sure. My responsibility to my children is the highest responsibility, I don’t want to do anything that is painful or destructive to them if I can help it.” But just weeks later, it appears that Bennifer 2.0 is still going from strength to strength, with Ben even at the forefront of Jennifer’s resolutions for 2022. Taking to her Instagram page on Tuesday, the singer spoke openly about her plans for the year, sharing: “I’m just thinking about being really mindful about what I want my life to be, and knowing my thoughts create my life, so keeping those really positive.” Jennifer went on: “To be the best mother I can be, the best partner I can be, the best friend I can be, the best daughter, sister, boss, person that I can be.” The vows came as Ben offered a fresh insight into his and Jennifer’s relationship during a new interview published on Tuesday, in which he opened up about the romance's origin story in 2001. The pair first met on the set of the movie Gigli, which was released in 2003 but began filming two years earlier. The movie bombed at the box office and received widely negative reviews. Despite Gigli’s lack of acclaim, Ben has fond memories of it — largely because it introduced him to Jennifer. In a new interview with Matt Damon for Entertainment Weekly, Ben shared: “If the reaction to Gigli hadn't happened, I probably wouldn't have ultimately decided, 'I don't really have any other avenue but to direct movies,' which has turned out to be the real love of my professional life. So in those ways, it's a gift.” He added: “And I did get to meet Jennifer, the relationship with whom has been really meaningful to me in my life."" Ben previously acknowledged how “lucky” he is to have ""benefitted from second chances"" throughout his life, telling WSJ magazine for its December/January cover story: “I've had second chances in my career. I've had second chances as a human being."" Thankfully, he and Jennifer both seem to be making the most of their second chance at their relationship."

“I love my sister,” she added. ""And she knows that. So I don’t know why we’re in this position right now.""
 


“When it was put into place I was a 17-year-old. I was about to have a baby, so I didn’t understand what was happening,” she said. “Nor was I focused on that. I was focused on the fact that I was a 17-year-old about to have a baby.”
 


“There was a time where my sister asked me — of her trust and will — if I would be the person who was sure that her boys got what they needed,” she said.“Once I realized that ... she’s in a conservatorship, I felt like I just didn’t want to be a part of [it] until maybe she was out of the conservatorship,” she said.
 


“I went out of my way to make sure that she had the contacts she needed to possibly go ahead and end this conservatorship, and just end this all for our family,” she said. “If it’s gonna cause this much discord, why continue it?”She added, “Everyone has a voice and it should be heard. So if she wanted to talk to other people … I set that up. I even spoke to her legal team … previous legal team, and that did not end well in my favor.”
 


“It was really important for me to first off honor my voice,” she said of her decision to release the tell-all book.“I have to do it or how else can I expect my daughters to stand up for themselves?” she added.
 


“We say we do better, but now we just go into the comments on Instagram and do it,” she said, perhaps referring to the onslaught of hate and negative attention she’s received in recent months.
 


The censored message, which Jamie Lynn shared as an Instagram story, read: “White trash bitch I hope your daughter gets [r*ped]. Both of them.”
 


“[Growing] up I had to learn to not acknowledge the hate, and to rise above the evil and NEVER give negativity the attention it so desperately wants, but this is one of the ones I can’t just brush off,” she continued.“You may not love me, and that’s fine,” she said, ""but THIS shouldn’t be tolerated under any circumstances, much less about innocent underage children.""

She told W Magazine, “The most important element in becoming Patrizia was dyeing my own hair brown. I couldn't be blonde with that Italian accent — I was still myself.”
 


“It was nearly impossible for me to speak in the accent as a blonde,” she said. “I instantly had to dye my hair, and I started to live in a way whereby anything that I looked at, anything that I touched, I started to take notice of where and when I could see money.“I started to take photographs as well,” she went on. “I have no evidence that Patrizia was a photographer, but I thought as an exercise, and finding her interests in life, that I would become a photographer, so I took my point-and-shoot camera everywhere that I went. I noticed that Patrizia loved beautiful things. If something wasn’t beautiful, I deleted it.”
 


“I had some psychological difficulty at one point towards the end of filming,” she explained. “I was either in my hotel room, living and speaking as [Patrizia] Reggiani, or I was on set, living and speaking as her. I remember I went out into Italy one day with a hat on to take a walk. I hadn’t taken a walk in about two months and I panicked... I thought I was on a movie set.”

137,The Queen’s second son is accused of sexually abusing a then-teen girl who was being sex trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein.,"


A federal judge in New York on Wednesday declined to dismiss a sexual assault lawsuit against Prince Andrew, who is being sued by a woman who claims she was forced to have sex with him while she was a minor and under the control of former financier Jeffrey Epstein.Judge Lewis Kaplan said in his ruling that he denied ""in all respects"" the duke's attempts to stop the case.The decision is the latest blow against Andrew, who has consistently denied the accusations of Virginia Giuffre, now 38, and a vocal critic of the justice system’s failures in the Epstein case. The Duke of York’s lawyers have unsuccessfully fought to have the civil lawsuit thrown out for months. Advertisement     In the lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Giuffre says Andrew sexually abused her on multiple occasions between 2000 and 2002 while knowing that she was a sex trafficking victim under the age of 18. Specifically, Giuffre says she was forced to engage in sex acts with the duke in London, New York, and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands.Andrew was a longtime friend and associate of Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and Epstein’s former girlfriend and recently convicted coconspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein killed himself in a federal detention center in August 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and abusing dozens of underage girls, some as young as 14. Maxwell, 60, was found guilty of federal sex trafficking charges for her role in Epstein’s illicit operation on Dec. 29. She could face up to 65 years in prison.Giuffre first publicly accused Andrew of sexual assault in a sworn statement for a different Epstein-related lawsuit in December 2014. She then sued Andrew for battery and emotional damages on Aug. 9, 2021, under New York’s Child Victims Act of 2019, a temporary law that allowed people over the age of 55 to file civil lawsuits related to childhood sexual abuse — no matter how long ago the incident — but only during a limited time period.The duke and his legal team have fought from the beginning to make Giuffre's case go away. Andrew was able to avoid being served for nearly a month — and even then, his legal team at first claimed that he had not been properly presented with the official documents under UK and international law. (Kaplan rejected this argument in a ruling dated Sept. 17.)
 


Before the hearing, Kaplan rejected a defense motion that attempted to delay proceedings based on the argument that Giuffre primarily resides in Australia and not the United States. The judge also ordered the unsealing of a 2009 secret settlement between Epstein and Giuffre, which Andrew’s legal team claimed included a clause preventing her from suing the royal. Advertisement     In the hearing, the duke’s lawyer Andrew Brettler questioned the constitutionality of the Child Victims Act and cited Giuffre’s 2009 settlement of a sex trafficking case against Epstein in his arguments to dismiss charges on Tuesday. He also argued that Giuffre had not been explicit enough in her allegations against Andrew, which led to a tense moment in the virtual courtroom.""Ms. Giuffre doesn't articulate what supposedly happened to her at the hands of Prince Andrew,"" he said. “We do not know the details of the allegations, and it's time that we do before Prince Andrew should be required to answer these very serious allegations.""“That's not a dog that's going to hunt here,” Kaplan responded, saying that Giuffre’s claim that she had been forced to engage in sexual intercourse was specific enough for the current stage of the proceedings.The judge emphasized this in his ruling. ""Ms. Giuffre's complaint is neither 'unintelligible' nor 'vague' nor 'ambiguous,'"" he wrote. ""It alleges discrete incidents of sexual abuse in particular circumstances at three identifiable locations. It identifies to whom it attributes that sexual abuse.""Kaplan also shot down the defense's arguments about the constitutionality of the Child Victim's Act, saying that it had been upheld in the face of other legal challenges. (He called Brettler's argument ""creative"" but ""without merit."")A provision in the 2009 settlement between ​​Giuffre and Epstein prohibits her from pursuing legal action against the financier and anyone who “could have been included as a potential defendant” in that matter. Although the document does not name Andrew, Brettler argued that he should be included in the “potential defendant” category.Giuffre’s lawyer David Boies disagreed, saying that the 2009 settlement only concerned sex trafficking.“​​There is no allegation that Prince Andrew was the person transporting. There is no allegation that Prince Andrew fell into the category of people who were doing the trafficking,” Boies said. “He was somebody to whom the girls were trafficked.""Kaplan sided with Boies on this point in his opinion, saying the settlement does not preclude Andrew from facing Giuffre's accusations in a court of law.""The 2009 agreement cannot be said to demonstrate, clearly and unambiguously, that the parties intended the instrument 'directly,' 'primarily,' or substantially 'to benefit Prince Andrew,'"" he wrote. ""The Court cannot rewrite the 2009 agreement to give the defendant rights where the agreement does not clearly manifest an intent to create them."" Advertisement     The next key date in the case is Jan. 14, when Giuffre’s legal team will respond to discovery requests from Andrew’s attorneys.Andrew is ninth in line to the British throne. He stepped back from royal life following a disastrous BBC interview in November 2019, in which he denied dancing with or meeting Giuffre — despite having been pictured with his arm around her waist (Andrew said he had no memory of the photograph being taken). He also disputed Giuffre’s allegation that he sweated on her while dancing at a London club by claiming that he cannot perspire as a result of his military experience in the Falkland Islands.Giuffre’s lawyers have requested as part of the discovery process proof of this medical condition and evidence that he was, as he told the BBC, attending a birthday party at a Pizza Express with his daughter on the date of one of the alleged assaults.

138,"Bellecourt cofounded the American Indian Movement, which fought against police brutality and discrimination against Native Americans.","


Clyde Bellecourt, a longtime leader in Native Americans' fight for civil rights, died Tuesday from cancer, his wife told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. He was 85.In 1968, Bellecourt helped found the American Indian Movement, which began as a local group in Minneapolis fighting against police brutality and discrimination against Native Americans. The AIM did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News, but confirmed his death to the Associated Press. Advertisement     ""He loved the Native people,"" his wife Peggy Bellecourt told the Star Tribune. ""He loved being out there, trying to help improve conditions.""The organization widened its scope to take on national issues and went on to lead major protests nationwide in the 1970s, including a march to Washington, DC, known as the Trail of Broken Treaties. The demonstration was aimed at highlighting the federal government's failure to fulfill treaty obligations.In 1973, AIM led a 71-day occupation of the town of Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota to protest the US and tribal governments. The occupation turned violent and two people were killed.

139,The 36-year-old had built a reputation as one of the most prolific rappers in the industry.,"


Two men have been arrested in connection to the fatal shooting of rapper Young Dolph in Tennessee last year, but law enforcement officials on Wednesday said they have yet to determine a motive in the deadly shooting.Investigators are still sorting through a slew of tips, information, rumors, and innuendo to pin down why the two suspects — one of them a rapper — allegedly carried out the killing.""We're just not ready to put this out yet,"" Memphis Police Chief C.J. Davis said at a news conference Wednesday.Young Dolph, whose given name is Adolph Robert Thornton Jr., was shot at Makeda's Homemade Butter Cookies in Memphis in November. The 36-year-old made his debut in 2008 with ""Paper Route Campaign"" and built a reputation as one of the most prolific rappers in the industry, at one point making a music video from his hospital room after being shot in Los Angeles in 2017. His collaborators included Megan Thee Stallion and Gucci Mane, and he often worked with his fellow Memphis rapper and protégé Key Glock. Advertisement     
 


There were no suspects immediately after the shooting but, on Jan. 5, the US Marshals Service and Memphis Police announced a $15,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Justin Johnson, a Memphis native and rapper who goes by the name of Straight Drop.Johnson had stated on social media on Monday that he planned to turn himself in, according to a statement from the Shelby County District Attorney's Office. But ultimately, he didn't.Instead, Johnson was taken into custody in Indiana Tuesday, the US Marshals officials said in a statement. Johnson was found after officials received more than 500 tips, largely prompted by the reward, officials said.Johnson also had an outstanding warrant for violating the terms of his supervised federal release, according to the statement.A third man, 27-year-old Shondele Barnett, was also taken into custody along with Johnson and facing charges of being an accessory after the fact. Barnett is suspected of aiding Johnson as the two traveled through Indiana during the manhunt.On Tuesday, the Shelby County district attorney also announced that a grand jury had charged a second man, 32-year-old Cornelius Smith, with first-degree murder and a second count of attempted first-degree murder in connection to the deadly shooting on Nov. 17.Smith was arrested on Dec. 9 on an auto theft warrant for a white Mercedes-Benz, the vehicle authorities believe was used in the killing of Dolph.The car was stolen on Nov. 10 and found on Nov. 20, three days after the deadly shooting.Smith is in custody in Shelby County Jail.Johnson has not yet been charged in the killing, but Davis said an indictment was forthcoming.Shelby County District Attorney Amy Weirich said Johnson had a lengthy criminal record that included an aggravated rape and aggravated robbery conviction when he was 17. In 2017, Johnson was convicted and served five years after shooting three people in a bowling alley.He was released nine months into his sentence, Weirich said, and in 2018, was indicted on a federal gun charge.He had been released from federal custody in May 2021.On Wednesday, officials declined to released more details about the November shooting, but said they had enough information to name Johnson as a person of interest in the shooting. An indictment, Davis said, was forthcoming.""We had enough probable cause to put out this wanted flyer for Johnson and we have enough information to ensure that he will see his day in court,"" Davis said.

141,"Prosecutors say the informant’s statements should be barred from court, but defense attorneys have other ideas.","


An attorney for one of the defendants in the alleged plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has launched a direct attack on the credibility of the prosecution, claiming it misrepresented its knowledge of the actions of a key FBI informant whom it recently disparaged as a rogue “double agent.”The informant, Stephen Robeson, was accused last week by prosecutors of disobeying FBI rules and undermining the investigation into an alleged conspiracy to kidnap Whitmer and try her for treason. Among Robeson’s offenses, they claimed, was “offering use of 501(c) charity funds to purchase weapons for attacks.” Advertisement     But according to a new filing Tuesday by the attorney for defendant Adam Fox, the FBI was well aware that Robeson had made such offers. The filing includes a transcript of an August 2020 recording — listened to by two of the lead FBI agents in the probe — in which another informant tells Fox that the charity was used to purchase weapons.“While the Government attempts to minimize his involvement and its knowledge of the same,” the attorney, Christopher Gibbons, wrote, “the FBI maintained an intimate knowledge and control of [Robeson] and his activities.”A spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment on the matter, referring inquiries to the Justice Department. A spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Michigan also declined to comment, citing official policy to not discuss ongoing criminal matters.The five men facing federal trial in the case claim that they were entrapped by the government — and in particular by Robeson and another FBI informant, both of whom worked to recruit potential suspects, organize events such as the surveillance of Gov. Whitmer’s vacation home, and make hundreds of hours of clandestine recordings. The defendants also contend that there was no true conspiracy to kidnap anyone, and that the only planning was done by the FBI and its operatives. Advertisement     Prosecutors have pushed back, arguing that the defendants were predisposed to take violent action against the governor because of the strict COVID policies she had implemented. But they have also asked the judge to sharply limit the evidence that can be admitted into court when the trial begins March 8.They have, for example, said that they will not call three lead FBI agents in the case, and argued that many of the statements those men made during the course of the investigation should not be allowed as evidence. And last week they said that because of his misconduct, statements by Robeson should also be kept out of the courtroom.Robeson, who had been convicted of multiple felonies dating back to the early 1980s, began work for the FBI on Oct. 20, 2019, new evidence disclosed in Tuesday’s filing reveals, and was terminated as a confidential informant on Oct. 28, 2020, three weeks after the defendants in the Michigan case were arrested. The FBI paid him $19,328.79 for his work, the new evidence shows, and he helped organize at least four events that the government highlighted as critical in the evolution of the alleged conspiracy, even going so far as to pay for pizza, “moonshine,” and hotel rooms for attendees.While he was still working on the case, Robeson acquired a .50 caliber sniper rifle despite prohibitions on gun ownership by people with felony convictions. He was indicted last March in federal court on the gun charge and agreed to a plea deal in September. That deal, which offered him no jail time despite his extensive record and a statutory maximum sentence of 10 years, was an extremely favorable one — particularly if, as prosecutors now allege, they knew he had been secretly working “against the interests of the government.”Last month, Robeson was charged again, this time in Wisconsin state court. Notably, he is alleged to have defrauded a couple out of an SUV by convincing them it was going to a charity he controlled. Investigators found that there was no such charity and that Robeson had simply kept the vehicle for his own use. That fraud is alleged to have taken place during the same month that the two FBI agents overheard the conversation about Robeson’s use of a charity to acquire weaponry. Advertisement     In their filing last Thursday, prosecutors called Robeson a “noncompliant informant,” saying he undertook a number of “unauthorized acts,” including offering the charity funds, obtaining weapons, and offering to use a drone “to aid in acts of terrorism.” They also claim he failed to record certain events he was supposed to be informing the FBI about, attempted to destroy other evidence, and warned at least one defendant that he’d been approached by the government.Citing those reasons, prosecutors took the unusual step of arguing that his statements and actions while working for the FBI should be excluded from the case.In Tuesday’s filing, Gibbons challenged that argument. “The Government consistently relied on a specific cadre of agents and confidential informants from as early as October 2019 to October of 2020 in establishing its case against these defendants. The Government now seeks to distance itself from the very same group agents and informants, and their inconvenient actions and statements during the upcoming jury trial.”A hearing on what evidence will be admitted at trial is scheduled for next Tuesday in federal court.Jessica Garrison contributed to this report.

142,"Joe Biden’s speech in Georgia was “stirring,” but the two major voting rights bills are still far from becoming law.","


In his second sweeping speech on voting rights as president, Joe Biden made his most forceful rebuke to date of Senate Republicans for blocking laws that would protect voters. But six months on from Biden's first address calling for the bills to pass, they're still far from becoming a reality.“I ask every elected official in America, how do you want to be remembered? Consequential moments in history, they present a choice,” Biden said. “Do you want to be on the side of Dr. King or George Wallace? You want to be the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor? You want to be on the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis?” Advertisement     Biden for the first time made it clear that he supports changing Senate rules to pass voting rights reform. That would require amending the way the Senate works for these specific bills so that they can pass with a simple majority instead of the current requirement of 60 votes to end a filibuster. Despite the president’s overt support for that change on Tuesday, it’s unlikely to happen. Two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have so far said they won’t vote for it, and several others are publicly undecided. Every Senate Democrat would need to vote to change the rules for the move to succeed.“We have no option but to change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster for this,” Biden said. “The filibuster is not being used by Republicans to bring the Senate together but to pull it further apart. The filibuster has been weaponized and abused.”Two landmark bills remain stalled in the Senate, and voting rights activists say they’ve yet to see a concrete plan from the White House on how they’ll get it passed. Biden’s remarks on Tuesday largely repeated his rhetoric from July 2021, when he gave a speech in Philadelphia, and from his calls on the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.""I've been around the Senate a long time, and as vice president for eight years. I've never seen a circumstance where not one single Republican has a voice and is ready to speak for justice,” Biden said of Senate Republicans on Tuesday. Advertisement     He added that he had even worked with Sen. Strom Thurmond, a segregationist Republican, to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act at one point.He struck a much firmer tone with Republicans this week than he had last July, when Biden said he would be asking his “Republican friends — in Congress, in states, in cities, in counties — to stand up, for god’s sake, and help prevent this concerted effort to undermine our elections and the sacred right to vote.”Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Atlanta to give the speeches despite several prominent local voting rights leaders boycotting their event, calling on them to stay in DC and get the legislation passed.“We were hoping that would be followed by the White House leaning into this issue of the legislation and the filibuster,” said Cliff Albright, executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, of Biden’s July speech. “That did not happen, and that is why we're at the place where right now where what we're saying is we don't need another speech. What we need is actually a plan.”The Freedom to Vote Act would standardize voter ID laws and permanently allow voting by mail, ban partisan gerrymandering, and set national standards for elections. The John Lewis Voting Rights Act would reestablish the Voting Rights Act, which was weakened by two Supreme Court decisions in the past decade, by specifically reinstating antidiscrimination protections for voters.For some, Biden’s visit brought welcome attention to the restrictive voting measures being put in place in Georgia.“We have been raising the alarm. It's not even canary in the coal mine anymore. It's like, the British are here. They’re not coming,” said Nsé Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project. “So this is an unqualified recognition that the fight for voting rights is the most important fight for our government right now, for our leaders right now.”Ufot, like others on the ground, said she’s waiting to see what action follows this speech.“If my president and my vice president see this as an important intervention on the path to getting us the voting rights protections that our country needs right now, then I’m with it. Go for it,” Ufot said. “But what I'm saying is that we need a plan. We need a plan. We need to share the plan to get legislation passed.” Advertisement     NAACP President Derrick Johnson said he was “agnostic” on whether Biden and Harris should travel to Georgia on Tuesday. After the speech, he said in a statement that Biden “delivered a stirring speech today” but that “it’s time for this administration to match their words with actions, and for Congress to do their job.”

143,The rumors reached new heights after a video of Ayesha speaking about lacking “male attention” outside of her and Steph’s marriage resurfaced on Twitter last month.,"


“They both have side hookups and flings but keep it very private to keep up the perfect family image they show to the world. I was shocked to learn, they’ve been together for so long,” it continued. 
 


“Do you know how ridiculous that is?” she added. “Don’t disrespect my marriage like that. Please and thank you.”
 


Praising Ayesha’s reply, one person commented, “Excellent response. Some of y'all are way too comfortable speaking to people recklessly.”“Y’all really be commenting this stuff under ppl pics? Lol that’s so weird and unnecessarily involved,” one user wrote.“Y’all need to learn how to stay out of married folks business,” echoed another.
 


“The ladies will always be lurking, hoping for their moment and waiting,” she said. “But for me... I honestly hate it. I don’t like when I feel, like, leveled off with someone. It just irks my nerves.”
 


Ayesha added, “But there have been a couple of times where I’ve wanted to punch somebody in the face for sure.“He doesn’t necessarily know how to deal with that... He can’t see it coming, I see it from a mile away.”
 


Those whom she was in conversation with — including the show’s host, Jada, daughter, Willow Smith, and mom, Adrienne Banfield-Norris, as well as the women of the Curry family — consoled Ayesha and let her know that while she “wasn’t looking” for attention elsewhere, she simply wouldn’t notice any that she happened to receive.
 


“I am human,” she wrote. “It brings me pure joy to speak my mind, be vulnerable at times and to know myself inside and out.”
 


“If you get a chance to watch the actual [Red Table Talk] and not the headlines and rumors please do! There is so much more depth to the talk,” Ayesha continued.“As women let’s continue to uplift, empower and not suppress and compress our feelings and thoughts, as fleeting as some of them may be,” she concluded.

144,Here’s what the bride made of the risqué wedding look which left the internet divided…,"Kendall Jenner has finally spoken out about the little black dress that divided the internet. In case you need reminding, the 26-year-old found herself at the center of an explosive debate back in November after she attended the wedding of her friend, Lauren Perez, wearing a particularly eye-catching look. The black Mônot dress in question — which Kendall wore for the wedding reception — was aptly described by Vogue as a “skin-baring technical feat” and consisted of carefully placed triangular cutouts that exposed her bare midriff. And so, while she’s usually celebrated for her show-stopping looks on the runway, Kendall’s head-turning party dress caused quite the stir among fans who felt that it wasn’t appropriate for the occasion. Spiraling into a wider debate about wedding guest etiquette, some even accused Kendall of trying to upstage Lauren on her special day, suggesting that the fashion choice had been “blatantly disrespectful.” Thankfully, both ladies have now entered the chat to finally set the record straight. So, just when we thought we’d heard the last of the matter, the dress debate was reignited on New Year’s Eve after Lauren shared some snaps from her big day. “The greatest night of 2021! Happy New Year everyone!!!” the newlywed captioned her NYE Instagram post, which included several new photographs of Kendall’s afterparty attire. Once again, the risqué dress drew criticism from fans, including one who commented on the post calling the look ""inappropriate"" and ""cringe."" “Inappropriate outfit at a wedding @kendalljenner, I'm embarrassed for you. #cringe,” the user wrote. But not everyone shared the same sentiments. Taking the other side of the debate, another fan quickly hit back, asking: “If the bride herself doesn't gaf, why do you care, relax?” The exchange caught the attention of the bride, who put speculation to rest by backing up the second fan. “Tell ‘em!” Lauren wrote in agreement. “SHE LOOKED STUNNING AND I LOVED IT!” Swiftly weighing in for herself, Kendall broke her silence on the matter to confirm that she had sought the bride’s approval beforehand. “Obvi asked for your approval in advance too,” the model wrote in response to her friend. “We love a beach wedding.” And there you have it. Interestingly, Lauren has since removed all comments from the post, hopefully marking an official conclusion to the months-spanning debate. Meanwhile, another wedding conspiracy involving Kendall still remains unsolved. If you’ve been keeping an eye on social media over the last few weeks, you might already have heard whispers that Kendall walked down the aisle herself. Before you get too excited, it’s important we preface that there is a severe lack of evidence to support this fan theory, but feel free to make up your own mind as we present the facts. So, like Lauren, Kendall rang in the new year with an Instagram post of her own, documenting how she and her longtime boyfriend, NBA star Devin Booker, spent the holidays. And while there was plenty to marvel over in the festive photo dump, fans were quick to notice a very ~particular~ piece of jewelry located on Devin’s left ring finger. Inevitably, the presence of a conveniently placed gold band had fans spiraling in the comments section, theorizing that perhaps he and Kendall had tied the knot in secret. But despite fans' optimism, it’s worth noting that (as it stands) Kendall’s left hand appears to be void of any corresponding jewelry, presenting a minor hitch in the ~slightly~ flawed theory. Nonetheless, these two seem pretty happy together, and off the back of her bestie’s wedding, who says it’s out of the question?"
145,"“Soooo this has taken a turn for the worse,” one congressional staffer wrote to federal law enforcement agencies during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.","


WASHINGTON – At least two congressional staffers from House and Senate committees reached out to the FBI and the Justice Department concerned about security at the Capitol ahead of the Jan. 6 riots, according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News.The inquiries support accusations that the FBI and other law enforcement agencies were not prepared for the pro-Trump mob that stormed the US Capitol despite direct warnings and calls for help.BuzzFeed News is publishing another cache of documents turned over by the Justice Department in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the agency and the FBI related to events around Jan. 6. Emails released last November revealed that top Justice Department officials were told there were “no credible threats” hours before the riot. Advertisement     
 


The House Intelligence Committee on Jan. 5, 2021, requested a threat assessment and clarification on coordination between the FBI and the Defense Department related to the joint session, citing a “heightened public concern” about the role of law enforcement during the presidential transition.“In response, the Committee received a brief and non-substantive reply from the FBI that did not provide any information about potential threats on January 6,” a House Intel committee official told BuzzFeed News in a statement.
 


Another Democratic staffer from the Senate Appropriations Committee sent multiple emails before and during the Capitol riot asking if additional law enforcement would be deployed ahead of Congress’s joint session. The messages highlight the concern some congressional offices felt ahead of the “Stop the Steal” rally on Jan. 6, where then-president Donald Trump was expected to promote the falsehood of a stolen presidential election.The unidentified Senate staffer’s correspondence with DOJ and the FBI began as early as Jan. 4 and ran until Jan. 7, according to the report. The staffer requested information before Jan. 6 as to which law enforcement agencies were on the ground and which agency was managing the ground forces and asked if DOJ had deployed air assets. But on the day the mob of Trump supporters breached the Capitol, the emails to DOJ took on a new sense of urgency.By 2:45 p.m., 30 minutes after the rioters forced their way into the Capitol and ransacked the Senate chambers, the staffer sent an alarming message inquiring about DOJ’s presence.“Sooooo this has taken a turn for the worse,” the staffer wrote. “Can we have an update as to DOJ involvement, please?”The staffer also emailed the agencies immediately after Jan. 6. The committee would not identify the staffer but confirmed the office was in contact with DOJ and the FBI.
 


“We can confirm this was a staffer on the Appropriations Committee (minority staff at the time) asking relevant and timely questions to the DOJ and FBI, over which the committee has oversight, about a developing situation,” a committee spokesperson said in a statement.The Justice Department turned over additional documents as part of the new FOIA release, including intelligence memos prepared by the Department of Homeland Security and FBI that were sent to state and federal law enforcement agencies before and after the insurrection summarizing threats and the potential for civil unrest. One of the memos notes the FBI had monitored reports about ""various threats to harm"" then-president-elect Joe Biden, vice president–elect Kamala Harris, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Subsequent intelligence memos produced in the weeks following the insurrection tallied the number of tips passed onto the FBI, which by Jan. 21 reached 208,799.Additionally, the Justice Department released a redacted copy of then–acting deputy attorney general Richard Donoghue's handwritten notes from a Jan. 4, 2021, phone call he had with Michael Sherwin, the then–acting US attorney for the District of Columbia, that discusses crowd estimates and law enforcement plans. Donoghue’s notes say: ""no need for additional resources now.""
 


Congressional leaders peppered FBI and DOJ officials for answers on what they knew in the lead-up to Jan. 6 and how they planned to respond during a closed-door briefing on Jan. 12, according to a transcript of the call released as part of the new FOIA cache. The FBI told members during the briefing that they had issued eight wanted posters for 72 individuals who were captured on camera. A year later, the arrest count exceeds 700.But the Justice Department redacted much of the responses to lawmakers' questions, citing national security, ongoing law enforcement investigations, and law enforcement techniques and procedures.Rep. Rodney Davis, the top Republican on the House Administration Committee, asked about the security threat ahead of Trump’s Jan. 13 impeachment vote and sought to get clarification on whether the temporary fencing erected after the riots was enough protection for the Capitol complex.An FBI representative explained that the physical security of the Capitol and crowd control were not the purview of the agency.“We are not experts in determining if the Capitol was hardened enough.”

146,"""We're going to do whatever we can ... to make sure that there's lasting change for not just Britney, not just Nichelle, but everyone who is trapped in this corrupt system,"" one #FreeBritney organizer told BuzzFeed News.","


LOS ANGELES — The chants outside the downtown Los Angeles courthouse were familiar, but this time they weren't talking about Britney Spears.""Free Nichelle Nichols!""""Isolation is abuse!""""Hey hey, ho ho, the conservatorship has got to go!""On Monday afternoon, a group of just over a dozen #FreeBritney supporters and fans of Nichelle Nichols, who became a Star Trek legend for her portrayal of Nyota Uhura, marched around Stanley Mosk Courthouse to raise awareness about the 89-year-old actor's situation. Since 2018, Nichols has been living under what they believe is another abusive conservatorship that has allowed her son, Kyle Johnson, to take control of her life and finances and decide who she sees and where she lives. Advertisement     ""We're going to do whatever we can to shed light on the issue and to make sure that there's lasting change for not just Britney, not just Nichelle but everyone who is trapped in this corrupt system,"" #FreeBritneyLA organizer Kevin Wu told BuzzFeed News.
 


Known for her trailblazing role as Lt. Uhura in the original series that first aired in the 1960s, Nichols is now living with dementia, a condition that has made her susceptible to exploitation, Johnson claimed in his original petition to place her under the court's supervision. But her longtime friend Angelique Fawcette, a producer and actor, has argued that Nichols was and is able to manage her affairs with help from an assistant and that Johnson is not acting in her best interests.Instead, Fawcette says Johnson moved his mother out of her Woodland Hills home to New Mexico against her will, sold her property against her wishes, and isolated her from her friends. She points to a troubling 2019 recording of Nichols screaming at Johnson to get his hands off of her and a deposition from a former conservator who raised concerns about him having control as proof that he is unfit to take care of his mother. ""You're trying to get rid of me,"" Nichols cries at her son in the recording.""You just can't come and take people’s home and money and just say, 'Hey, it's mine. Sorry, you're old, you're almost dead anyway, so I'm taking this,'"" Fawcette told BuzzFeed News. ""Look at all these amazing old people who are out there doing things. They’re living the life 'til their last drop and that's really what I'm fighting for, for Nichelle."" Advertisement     BuzzFeed News uncovered abuse, neglect, and death across the US guardianship industry. Read our investigative series ""Beyond Britney"" here.During a hearing on Monday, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge overruled Fawcette's objections to Johnson's final accounting report for his mother's conservatorship, which is now under the jurisdiction of a New Mexico court, finding that she did not have standing to lodge her complaints and that they did not pertain to any specific line items in the report.
 


Fawcette and her attorney Matthew Taylor tried to argue that Johnson failed to declare Nichols' home and neighboring property as assets of the conservatorship estate and provide the necessary evidence required by state statute to sell the properties. They also alleged that Johnson may be misappropriating his mother's assets and asked for time to conduct discovery to investigate their concerns.His attorney, Jeffrey Marvan, argued that the objection regarding Nichols' home, which was sold after the conservatorship was moved out of California, should instead be raised in New Mexico, and said Johnson acted appropriately.""He’s the only son and child,"" Marvan told the court via videoconference. ""The conservatee’s family supports everything that my client is doing.""
 


Johnson's attorney did not respond to BuzzFeed News' request for comment Monday.Speaking to supporters outside the courthouse, Fawcette vowed to continue fighting for her friend.""I'd be damned if this is my last stand for Nichelle Nichols,"" she said. ""Whether you are white, Black, Latino, Asian, American Indian, Persian, no matter what you are, you have roots in the soil. And you have a right to stand up for yourself and you have a right to stand up for your family and your friends."" Advertisement     Dressed in a replica red Star Trek shirt like the one Nichols wore in the sci-fi show, Alexa Justo wiped her eyes as Fawcette spoke. The 26-year-old grew up worshipping Nichols as Lt. Uhura.""She was definitely one of the only people I could look up to as a kid,"" said Justo, who is Black and Latina. ""She made it cool to be smart. She made it cool to be strong and obviously the whole being a woman of color — it’s not just for me personally but for the world, in general, her being one of the only characters that wasn’t like a slave or a maid. That means a lot.""Justo said she didn't think it was fair for Nichols to be placed in conservatorship, a system in which people lose basic rights and are exposed to, as a BuzzFeed News investigation found, abuse, exploitation, and even death.""Whether you’re emotionally invested or not, you should give a shit,"" Justo said. ""And Nichelle’s awesome, so you should give a shit about her. ""

147,"Tenants of the public housing complex had also repeatedly reported malfunctioning doors, broken ventilation systems, and lack of heat.","


The Bronx apartment building where a fire killed 17 people Sunday had a history of serious violations related to heat, ventilation, and other safety issues, some of which were still unresolved when officials say a malfunctioning space heater sparked one of the deadliest blazes in the city’s history.The Twin Parks North West apartment building, built in 1972 in the Bronx’s Fordham Heights neighborhood, was home to dozens of families with low incomes, many of them immigrants. The 120-unit brick building had no fire escapes and outdated stairways, making it difficult for residents to flee the thick smoke that quickly enveloped their halls and homes largely in part to a door that did not close when it should have. The victims suffered from severe smoke inhalation, Daniel A. Nigro, the city’s fire commissioner, said, acknowledging that the death toll, which includes eight children, will likely rise as “there are many people fighting for their lives in the hospital.” Advertisement     This is the second time in just a week that residents in public housing died after a fire tore through their homes. Last Wednesday, flames swept through a crowded federally subsidized rowhouse in Philadelphia, killing 12 people, eight of them children.In the years and months before the Bronx blaze, tenants of the public housing complex had repeatedly reported that their apartments had no heat, faulty radiators, and broken ventilation systems, data shows.Bronx Park Phase III Preservation LLC, which owns the building and other affordable housing complexes, said it was fully cooperating with the investigation and helping assist residents.“We are devastated by the unimaginable loss of life caused by this profound tragedy,” the company said in a statement. “Our thoughts are with the families and friends of those who lost their lives or were injured, and we are here to support them as we recover from this horrific fire.” Advertisement     Violations filed with the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) show that some automatic self-closing doors, which are required in all buildings with three or more apartments and help slow a fire's spread, did not work in 2017 and 2019.The fire commissioner said Monday that when a family fled the fire on the second and third floor, their front door did not shut, which would have thwarted the spread of smoke. Another door on the 15th floor also malfunctioned and stayed open. Records show that the residents of the unit where the fire started had filed a ticket for a malfunctioning self-closing door in the past.An HPD spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that the department fixed those complaints in 2020, adding that issues pertaining to self-closing doors “were reinspected and all were observed corrected by HPD Inspectors by August 2020.” Last fiscal year, the department said it had issued more than 22,000 self-closing door violations and ultimately resolved 18,000.“Yesterday's fire was a devastating tragedy, and our hearts go out to all the families affected by the worst kind of loss,” HPD said. “We urge residents to report malfunctioning doors to property owners or call 311 if issues are not corrected and HPD will respond.”
 


Though property owners say the building was up to code, residents have said their doors did not close automatically.In October, someone on the 12th floor reported “broken or defective fire retardant material” in public parts of the building. That is a C-class violation, which means it’s “immediately hazardous.” Then on April 11, that same resident filed a request to repair “the broken or defective mechanical ventilation system” in the apartment. That ticket was still open at the time of the fire. Ten days earlier, another tenant filed a B-class violation, meaning “hazardous,” for an additional report of “broken or defective fire retardant material” on the first floor. That request is also still open, according to records. Other complaints from December and November flagged exposed electrical wiring in the lobby, broken radiators, and defective doors. Advertisement     In 2021, residents of the Twin Parks North West filed more than 30 complaints that detailed dangerous and poor living conditions. In addition to the filings about ventilation and fire retardant material, other “immediately hazardous” requests from tenants that remain open describe lead paint in their bathrooms and hallways, roach infestations in kitchen walls, and mice crawling throughout their entire apartments.One unit, 6K, made 10 different complaints last month alone, including “no heat,” roaches in the entire apartment, a front door that does not self-close, a broken radiator in the living room, a damaged pipe in the bathroom, and no heat. Most of these filings were marked as resolved before the blaze, according to records.Residents also had problems with their heat. Several reports dating back to December 2020, all of which have been marked as closed, describe apartments that had no heat. Officials say a space heater that had been running for a few days malfunctioned and sparked the fire, which New York housing advocates say signals that the heat was inadequate for the frigid temperatures that hit the borough last week.“The stories we have heard about inadequate heating in places like this are a broken record, and landlords are not held accountable,” Edward Garcia, the director of community development for the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, a racial and economic justice organization, told BuzzFeed News. “People do what they need to do to stay safe. Being in a really cold apartment triggers health issues like asthma, and the Bronx has some of the worst health outcomes in the state.”On Monday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams reiterated that the building had ""no outstanding violations"" for complaints related to lack of heat. But in an interview with Good Morning America, he also acknowledged that there “may have been a maintenance issue” with the apartment door where the fire started. Advertisement     
 


The Twin Parks North West is part of a public housing portfolio recently acquired and managed by a group of wealthy, high-profile investors, emblematic of a housing market trend where real estate conglomerates have been buying lower-income housing buildings. As JustFix.nyc notes, Reliant Realty Services, a property management company is listed as the managing agent of the Bronx complex, is connected to 123 other New York City buildings, most of which are in lower-income neighborhoods.At the end of 2019, a group of real estate companies purchased the Twin Parks North West, along with other affordable housing units in the Bronx, as part of a $170 million deal, the Real Deal reported at the time. The LIHC Investment Group is officially known in city records as Bronx Park Phase III Preservation, and includes several high-profile investors, such as Camber Property Group. Camber has been scooping up affordable housing complexes and runs a spate of units across New York City, mostly in the Bronx. Its cofounder, Rick Gropper, is listed as the landlord for the Twin Parks complex and also happens to be named as a member of the mayor’s transition team for housing issues.In press releases and articles announcing the purchase of the eight Bronx buildings, the coalition of new property owners said they planned ""to make operational improvements"" and preserve the 1,275 units as affordable housing. According to state filings, the building has not had any applications for renovations since 2015 for plumbing.Gropper is named as the landlord for 43 of the 123 buildings in the portfolio, according to a database by JustFix.nyc. Eugene Schneur, the co-founder of another real estate firm called Omni New York, is listed as the landlord for the rest, but is not associated with Gropper, according to a spokesperson. According to records, tenants in these buildings have made 29,266 complaints, 12,203 of which were in the past three years. Advertisement     The buildings, however, do have a better average of closed complaints compared to the rest of the city (an average of 0.3 open HPD violations per unit vs the city's average of 0.8 per unit). The most common issue for residents is heat and hot water, the database notes.

148,Trump wants a judge to dismiss three lawsuits seeking to hold him responsible for the Jan. 6 insurrection.,"


WASHINGTON — Donald Trump cannot be sued for pretty much anything he said while he was in the White House, including his speech on Jan. 6 that preceded the attack on the US Capitol by his supporters and his tweets throughout the day, a lawyer for the former president argued in court on Monday.Less than a week after the one-year anniversary of the Capitol riot, a federal judge in Washington, DC, considered the fate of three civil lawsuits seeking to hold Trump and his allies responsible for the attack — specifically, conspiring to interfere with Congress’s certification of the 2020 election results and incite violence against police officers who tried to protect the Capitol complex. Advertisement     US District Judge Amit Mehta asked questions that suggested he was at a minimum skeptical of Trump’s sweeping argument that he was immune against being sued for nearly anything he’d said during his four years as president. But Mehta also said during the hearing that he was struggling with whether the core conspiracy claim could go forward based on the facts laid out in the lawsuits, and whether comments by Trump and some of his other high-profile supporters on Jan. 6 were covered by the First Amendment’s free speech protections.It was the second time in just over a month that a court considered the argument that Trump couldn’t personally be sued over things he said while he was president. In early December, a federal appeals court in New York weighed efforts by Trump, backed by the Justice Department, to have the US government take over his defense against a defamation lawsuit filed by the writer E. Jean Carroll. A lower court judge had rebuffed the argument that Trump was acting within the scope of his official duties when he said Carroll was lying after she accused him of raping her more than two decades ago. The appeals court has yet to rule.Trump isn’t trying to involve the Justice Department in his defense against the growing number of lawsuits seeking to hold him responsible for the events of Jan. 6. He’s broadly arguing that he’s protected by a legal doctrine that shields sitting presidents from being sued over actions they take as part of the job. Arguments on Monday focused on three of the cases: one brought by a group of congressional Democrats, one brought by Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell, and one brought by two US Capitol Police officers.A ruling from Mehta won't end the legal wrangling over Trump’s civil liability for the insurrection. If Trump fails to convince Mehta to toss these first three cases, he could ask an appeals court and potentially the US Supreme Court to intervene. If Trump succeeds at this stage, the plaintiffs could appeal. And there are four other civil lawsuits pending that accuse Trump of inciting the violence, plus one filed before Jan. 6 that accuses Trump of conspiring with the Republican National Committee to violate the rights of Black voters by trying to undermine the results of the election. Advertisement     Trump’s lead attorney, Jesse Binnall — a Virginia-based lawyer representing Trump in an array of postpresidency legal fights, and who counts Trump ally Michael Flynn as a former client and conservative attorney and activist Sidney Powell as a former co-counsel — argued Monday that presidential immunity extended to the “outer perimeters” of a president’s actions while in office.Mehta asked if Binnall wanted the judge to ignore the content of what Trump said on Jan. 6. Binnall replied yes, explaining that what mattered for immunity was the type of act at issue, which in this case was a speech to the American people, something that is part of being president.Mehta pushed back, pointing out that the lawsuits alleged that Trump had appeared at the Jan. 6 rally to advance his personal interests as a candidate for office. The judge asked Binnall why that wouldn’t place Trump outside the immunity that’s meant to protect a president against being sued for actions that were part of their official duties. Binnall argued that there was too much overlap between a president’s duties and political motivations to try to draw a clear line. Even if campaign activities weren’t covered by the immunity, Binnall said, Trump’s speech on Jan. 6 was not part of his campaign.The judge then asked about reports that Trump had contacted Georgia’s top election official to ask him to “find” votes to overturn President Joe Biden’s win in the state. Mehta asked Binnall if presidential immunity would apply to that type of phone call. Binnall said it would because a president had a constitutional duty to ensure laws were faithfully executed. When the judge noted that part of the Constitution didn’t apply to state laws, Binnall said that when it came to federal elections, state and federal functions merged.Mehta asked if a president would get immunity if they made defamatory statements at a campaign rally. Binnall said yes.The judge then asked if there was anything a president could say while they were in office that they could be sued for. Binnall said he’d tried to think of examples and could not.On the substance of the lawsuits, Mehta said that the plaintiffs had alleged a “very unusual” and “problematic” conspiracy. Taken together, the cases accused Trump of conspiring with high-profile allies like Rudy Giuliani as well as extremist groups whose members are being criminally prosecuted for storming the Capitol. The judge noted that the lawsuits didn’t feature the kind of direct communication among co-conspirators that would normally be part of a case like this. He expressed concern that it would be “dangerous” to build a conspiracy case off of reactions to political speech. Advertisement     Joseph Sellers, an attorney for the congressional Democrats suing Trump who argued on behalf of all three sets of plaintiffs on Monday, maintained that the lawsuits did lay out facts that alleged a “meeting of the minds,” and not just a one-sided reaction to Trump’s speech. He said that Trump’s supporters engaged with his social media posts leading up to Jan. 6 about coming to Washington, that Trump urged the crowd to go to the Capitol even as people yelled out about storming and invading the building, and that Trump failed to immediately try to stop the riot, which could be seen as proof that he endorsed the mob.Sellers said that the law didn’t require them to show direct communication among all of the defendants, and he pointed out that they had presented facts that alleged coordination between two right-wing groups named in one of the cases, the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys. Mehta acknowledged that was true, but noted that the plaintiffs would likely be disappointed if he allowed the conspiracy claims against those groups to go forward but dismissed them against Trump.Mehta is deeply familiar with the Justice Department’s theories so far on the role that members of the Oath Keepers played on Jan. 6. He’s presiding over a large conspiracy case that prosecutors have brought against members of the group; charges are pending against 17 defendants, and four defendants have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the government. The Oath Keepers have a pending motion to dismiss the Democrats’ civil lawsuit they’re named in, and Mehta is considering that as well.During an exchange with Binnall about the future of the conspiracy claim against Trump, Mehta asked about the fact that Trump didn’t tweet or put out other public statements telling the mob to stop immediately after the attack had begun. Binnall said that a president couldn’t be liable for not taking a certain action. The judge countered that Trump’s public silence could support the idea that Trump understood he was part of an agreement to disrupt Congress’s activities on Jan. 6. Mehta also drew a comparison to a civil lawsuit against organizers of the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 that turned violent; a jury last year found white nationalist Richard Spencer and others liable for conspiring to incite racially motivated violence. Advertisement     Mehta on Monday also considered whether claims lodged against Donald Trump Jr. and Giuliani, who were named as defendants in Swalwell’s case, could go forward. Mehta suggested there wasn’t as much of a record of Trump Jr. making public calls to action to the same extent as his father, and referenced public reports that Trump Jr. had messaged Trump’s chief of staff at the time, Mark Meadows, to try to get Trump to stop the mob.Near the end of the hearing, Mehta heard arguments on defendant Republican Rep. Mo Brooks’ effort to have the US government step into the case on his behalf, based on the argument that he was acting in his official capacity when he spoke at the Jan. 6 rally. The Justice Department has opposed stepping in on his behalf.

149,“What we're saying is we don't need another speech. What we need is actually a plan.”,"


A cadre of prominent voting rights organizations working on the ground in Georgia is boycotting President Joe Biden’s voting rights speech in the state Tuesday, protesting the slow progress on two landmark bills that have stalled in the Senate.“What we're saying is we don't need another speech. What we need is actually a plan,” said Cliff Albright, executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, on a call with reporters. “What we need is for him to lean into the filibuster and do what he has not yet done, which is give a clear call for it to be modified, not just telling us what he's open to, and not just telling us when he could possibly support if it's necessary, but to have a full-throated call for changing the filibuster in order to pass voting rights.” Advertisement     Biden plans to travel to Georgia with Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday, where both are slated to give speeches on the importance of voting rights legislation. There’s been little movement on Capitol Hill — despite Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's call for the Senate to vote on measures that would lay the groundwork to pass the voting rights legislation before Jan. 17.“​​There is not time during these fights to attend a speech and meet to reiterate the seriousness of this moment,” the groups said in a statement a day before Biden and Harris's trip to Georgia. The statement was signed by the New Georgia Project Action Fund, the Black Voters Matter Action Fund, the Asian American Advocacy Fund, the GALEO Impact Fund, and James Woodall, the former president of the Georgia NAACP.Asked about the groups’ calls for Biden to stay in DC and work on passing legislation rather than traveling to Georgia for the speech, White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated that the president would prefer to pass voting rights legislation with the support of a majority of the Senate.“His plan is to sign voting rights legislation into law,” Psaki told reporters during a Monday press briefing. “That requires a majority of senators to support it even if there are changes to the Senate rules, which is something the president has expressed an openness to.” Advertisement     The voting rights groups’ announcement to skip the president’s speech comes as they have grown frustrated that Senate procedure has stalled the bills. Senate Democrats support both bills but face a steep hurdle in the evenly divided chamber, where it takes 60 votes to pass legislation. Democrats have called for reforms to the procedure, which would require 51 votes, but Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have each voiced opposition to any carve-outs on the procedure.“It was very telling to us that this wasn't item number one on the agenda as soon as the president was inaugurated,” said Kendra Davenport Cotton, chief operating officer of the New Georgia Project.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell aggressively used the filibuster to kill legislation during the Obama and Trump administrations and has consistently warned Democrats against changing the rules.At the same time, 19 restrictive voting laws were passed in 2021 by Republicans on the state and local levels across the country, propelled by conspiracy theories denying the legitimacy of Biden’s win. In the past year, Georgia Republicans have passed several of those restrictive bills; the legislation at stake in the Senate would prevent those bills from taking effect, requiring states not to impose unreasonable voter ID and access laws and implementing national standards for how elections are run.“We think it sets a serious precedent that at the end of the day, when there are people that are coming after your base of voters, right, and you're stringing it out, and you're not reacting,” said LaTosha Brown, a Georgia-based advocate and cofounder of Black Voters Matter.She added, “How is it that now, myself, as a Black woman — I actually have less protection now than I did a year ago?”Biden previously called on the Senate to return to a rule that would require senators to continuously speak on the floor to delay a bill from passing. But advocates on the call said that the president needs to more forcefully back changing the filibuster rules.The two bills in question would significantly increase voter access in the US. The Freedom to Vote Act would standardize voter ID laws and permanently allow voting by mail, ban gerrymandering, and set national standards for elections. The John Lewis Voting Rights Act would reinforce portions of the Voting Rights Act, which was weakened by two Supreme Court decisions in the past decade, by specifically reinstating antidiscrimination protections for voters. Advertisement     Albright said the groups would only be satisfied if Biden and Harris arrive in Georgia tomorrow to announce an actual agreement on voting rights — with the backing of Sinema and Manchin. “Anything short of that would be disappointing and not worth the trip to Georgia,“ he said. “But the bare, bare minimum would be, as we have all said, a full-throated call for modifying the filibuster rules.”Some advocates want Biden to more firmly back Schumer’s call to hold a vote before Jan. 17 on carving out a voting rights exception to the filibuster.“We need Biden to demand that that vote happens this week,” Woodall said.He wants Biden to “call Manchin and Sinema out directly” for holding up the legislation.Rep. Nikema Williams of Georgia said she will attend the president's and vice president's speeches because she sees it as an opportunity to ground the push for the voting rights legislation in ""the cradle of the civil rights movement.""""I represent a district that was once held by Congressman John Lewis,"" she said. ""And I am going because it's imperative to me that the White House, specifically the president and the vice president, show that we have the full weight of the White House behind creating a path forward with the filibuster to get voting rights passed.""One major national civil rights group, the NAACP, did not join the local groups’ denunciation of the president’s visit — rather, its members will be watching closely in the days after the address for the president to push changes to the filibuster and then the voting rights bills, NAACP President Derrick Johnson told BuzzFeed News.Johnson said he’s seen the administration “muscle through and pass” other legislation like COVID relief, the debt ceiling raise, the infrastructure bill, and unemployment tax.“Placing the priority on the policy issues isn't about words, it is about outcomes. And we have yet to have an outcome of voting rights protections over a year,” he said.He said he does understand Georgia civil rights groups not supporting Biden’s visit. “What they’re expressing is their frustration knowing how important this is,"" he said. “So as I’m listening intently tomorrow, I’ll be watching the following days.”As far as he’s concerned, though, “how to get there is irrelevant as long as they get there.”

151,The Duchess of Cambridge’s life in 40 photos.,"


Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, marked her 40th birthday in style over the weekend with three new official portraits taken by Italian fashion photographer Paolo Roversi. Over her four decades, she's gone from a commoner to a member of the royal family — a massive change that we've decided to look back on in honor of her birthday.Catherine ""Kate"" Middleton was born on Jan. 9, 1982, to Carole Middleton, an airline steward, and Michael Middleton, a flight dispatcher. She met her future husband, Prince William, in 2001, when they both began their studies at St. Andrew's University in Scotland. The two became friends, and in their second year, Kate, William, and two other friends moved into an off-campus apartment together. They started dating in 2003 — reportedly after William was entranced by Kate modeling a revealing dress in a charity fashion show. Although they broke up in 2007, the two were soon back together and William proposed marriage in 2010. Their royal wedding on April 29, 2011, was watched by tens of millions of people around the world. William and Kate are now the parents of three children and preparing for their roles as the future Prince and Princess of Wales — and, eventually, king and queen consort. Here's a look back at Kate's journey to royal life. Advertisement

152,From searing dystopian futures to sweeping romantic fantasies and action-packed space adventures.,"


The School for Good Mothers by Jessamine Chan (Simon & Schuster)In the near future, the government's surveillance system has turned its eyes on mothers, scrutinizing women's behavior with dire consequences for any and every mistake. When 39-year-old Chinese American mom Frida Liu has one very bad day, her 18-month-old Harriet is taken away to live with Frida's ex-husband and his annoying girlfriend. To win her custody rights back, Frida must pass a yearlong course on how to be a good mother. Forced to live in prison-like conditions, Frida is given a robot doll modeled after her daughter to practice her mothering skills on. If Frida speaks out about the school's conditions or even questions policies, her record will be permanently marked, and she won't be able to see her daughter again. This devastating dystopian novel presents an honest glimpse into the difficulties of parenthood while calling out the culture of policing parents. Advertisement     Daughter of the Moon Goddess by Sue Lynn Tan (Harper Voyager; Jan. 11)This debut fantasy based on the Chinese myth of the moon goddess, Chang'e, is as beautiful as its cover. When Chang'e becomes pregnant and the healers predict that neither she nor the baby will survive, she takes her husband's elixir of immortality, given to him by the celestials for shooting down the sunbirds setting fire to the land. However, saving her and her daughter's life has a cruel cost — the celestials exile her to the moon for taking her husband’s elixir, ensuring that she can never leave and never see her husband again. She keeps her daughter, Xingyin, a secret from the celestials. Xingyin grows up suppressing her magic so the celestials won't notice her, but she's forced to flee her moon home when the celestials catch on that something isn't quite right on the moon. At first, she works as a maid, but soon she wins a place as a companion to the Crown Prince of the celestials, and eventually she becomes famed for her archery skills and bravery. Her one goal in life is to free her mother and to see her again. This first book in a fantasy duology has everything a great fantasy needs: magic, action, romantic angst, nuanced characters, mythical creatures, moral dilemmas, and more.The Bone Spindle by Leslie Vedder (Razorbill; Jan. 11)The treasure hunters Fi and Shane could not be more different. Fi is measured and relies on her deep knowledge of archaeology and ancient history to find the best treasure. On the other hand, Shane relies on her luck and brawn to get her through scraps. While Shane would typically avoid teaming up with the droll Fi, she’s found a map she can’t decode, and Fi is the only one with the knowledge to help her find the map’s treasure. However, instead of finding treasure, the two find a curse that’s held Prince Briar Rose captive for centuries. This queer, gender-flipped YA retelling of Sleeping Beauty is an adventurous blast, and a great way to begin 2022 if you’re looking for a fun, lighthearted read.Ashes of Gold by J. Elle (Denene Millner Books; Jan. 11)The final book in the Wings of Ebony YA fantasy duology is as explosive as the first. This duology embodies Black girl magic, with cutting critiques of racism and how Black girls are treated in contemporary society combined with a powerful, no-nonsense magic-user protagonist, Rue. The second book provides more of a glimpse into the magical world of Ghizon, where Rue is determined to find a way to reclaim the magic stolen from her father’s people. Despite the supposedly ideal, fantasy setting, Rue finds many of the same inequalities in Ghizon as she did in Houston. Both books in this series are super fun and intense reads full of action and lots of twists that readers will have trouble putting down.How High We Go in the Dark by Sequoia Nagamatsu (William Morrow; Jan. 18)Written as a series of interconnected short stories, this searing literary dystopia makes for especially bleak reading in the midst of a pandemic. In the near future, climate change has caused severe melting of permafrost, releasing an ancient virus that quickly spreads. A culture of death develops, where theme parks are built to help children die while having fun and couture funeral homes cater to the wealthy. Scientists are also desperately trying to find ways of staving off death, growing human organs in pigs and building spaceships to find a better place to live. Each character is intimately drawn as they grapple with a future that gives very little freedom to hope or dream. The full cast audiobook is an excellent listen. It feels like an archive of personal stories about what the future may bring. Advertisement     Akata Woman by Nnedi Okorafor (Viking Books for Young Readers; Jan. 18)In the third book in the Nsibidi Scripts series, 15-year-old Sunny Nwazue is now a powerful Leopard Person. She and her coven — Orlu, Sasha, and Chichi — need to track down Udide’s magical scroll, and they have seven days to do so. The scroll is located deep within the most dangerous parts of the spirit realm, and, meanwhile, Sunny is struggling to come to terms with being doubled, being both Sunny and her spirit face Anyanwu. Entertaining and action-packed, this Nigerian-based fantasy series is a must-read for YA readers. If you’re new to the series, start with Akata Witch.The Beholden by Cassandra Rose Clarke (Erewhon; Jan. 18)This sweeping, rich standalone has lots of classic fantasy vibes. It opens with two orphaned sisters hiring a boat owner to take them into a dangerous jungle at night so they can beg a favor of a goddess, the Lady of the Seraphine. Celestia asks the Lady to grant her a wealthy and kind husband to help the sisters’ farm thrive, but the Lady exacts a price. At some point in the future, she will require a favor of the sisters and the boat owner, and they must repay the debt, or else. Five years later, the kingdom is on the brink of war and disease is rampant, but Celestia and her sister Izara are thriving. Celestia is pregnant, and Izara is studying to be a mage. When the emperor calls Celestia’s husband away for a secret mention, the Lady of the Seraphine calls in her debt, and her demands put everything the sisters have worked toward at risk.Goliath by Tochi Onyebuchi (Tordotcom; Jan. 25)This complex dystopia takes place 30 years into a future where Earth has been decimated by climate change. The wealthiest have fled and live in space colonies, leaving those without the means to escape struggling to find some kind of normalcy in a crumbling infrastructure and environment. Jonathan and David are white men who decide to leave their space colonies and return to Earth. As they begin to rebuild in New Haven, Connecticut, their white privilege is in sharp contrast to the Black existence in New Haven. While Jonathan and David idealize their return to Earth, the laborers Linc, Bishop, and Sydney — who salvage buildings for space colonies to use — are just trying to survive the radiation poisoning, street violence, gentrification, and the general inhumanity in how they’re forced to live. With interweaving timelines and characters, this is a dense read that, like the best dystopias, critiques current political and social problems.Light Years from Home by Mike Chen (Mira; Jan. 25)Rich in character development, this literary science fiction centers on family drama in the wake of an alien abduction. Fifteen years ago, aliens took Jakob to become part of their military fleet, and his disappearance left his family in ruins. His dad became obsessed with finding him, and that obsession eventually led to his death. His younger sister, Evie, took over her dad's mission to find the truth and joined a UFO hunters group, becoming an integral member. Jakob's mother now has dementia, and his twin sister, Kass, takes care of her and doesn't believe for a second that aliens abducted Jakob. She believes her carefree, lazy brother is probably backpacking across Europe high on drugs, which is precisely what he tells his family when he reappears 15 years later. Advertisement     At The End of Everything by Marieke Nijkamp (Sourcebooks Fire; Jan. 25)The Hope Juvenile Treatment Center may claim to rehabilitate juvenile delinquents, but their treatment of the teens in their care is borderline abusive. When a plague sweeps the world, instead of informing the teenagers of the problem, the guards and every adult associated with the center abandon them, leaving them with very little food or medical supplies. When a group tries to leave the center, one of them is shot out of fear that they might be contagious. The defiant Grace is appointed as de facto leader of the center, while Leah, nonverbal and autistic, takes over food distribution after her twin sister is the first to come down with the plague. Emerson, a nonbinary violinist kicked out of their home by their strict Catholic parents, takes up the responsibility of burying the dead.

Vivid and surreal, readers of Carmen Maria Machado will enjoy this collection.Moon Witch, Spider King by Marlon James (Riverhead Books; Feb. 15)This second book in the Dark Star Trilogy — pitched as the African Game of Thrones — occurs simultaneously as Black Leopard, Red Wolf and can be read first or second. In the first book, Sogolon the Moon Witch is Tracker’s antagonist. Now the perspectives are switched, and Sogolon tells her 177-year-old story of how she became the Moon Witch and her feud with the Aesi, the king’s chancellor. Abused by her brothers as a child, then saved from a whorehouse by a woman and her pet monster, Sogolon eventually comes to work in the royal house. She sees kings rise and fall and remembers everything. Her expansive memory serves as a threat to the chancellor and also contradicts Tracker’s version of events in Black Leopard. Moving, vivid, and thought-provoking, this second book is, if anything, even more brilliant than the first.Mickey7 by Edward Ashton (St. Martin’s Press; Feb. 15)Mickey7 is an engrossing sci-fi thriller with a unique premise. The main character, Mickey7, is an Expendable, someone who is sent out on dangerous missions but can be regrown if they die.

153,Convicted murderer Robert Durst has died at 78. The multimillionaire was the focus of The Jinx documentary.,"


Robert Durst, the multimillionaire who was the focus of the HBO documentary The Jinx and who was found guilty of murdering his friend, died on Monday at a hospital in California, his attorney said. He was 78 years old.Durst died at a hospital near Stockton where he had reportedly been taken for testing. In a statement, one of Durst's trial lawyers, Chip Lewis, said his death was associated with his ongoing health problems.""We understand that his death was due to natural causes associated with the litany of medical issues we had repeatedly reported to the court over the last couple of years,"" he said.The New York Times reported that during his visit, he went into cardiac arrest and doctors were unable to revive him. In a statement, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said Durst died of natural causes at 6:44 a.m. while being treated at an outside hospital. The San Joaquin County coroner will determine an exact cause of death. Advertisement     Durst, who was sentenced on Oct. 14 to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the murder of Susan Berman in 2000, gained renewed notoriety in 2015 after seeming to confess to three murders that he’d been suspected of for years. His “confession” was made on The Jinx via a hot mic while in the bathroom after an incriminating interview for the show’s explosive finale.In the documentary, Durst is heard saying, “What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.” But it was later revealed that filmmaker Andrew Jarecki had manipulated the line; “Killed them all, of course” actually preceded Durst saying, “What the hell did I do?” with several muttered remarks between them.Still, Durst was arrested in New Orleans on March 14, 2015, the day before the finale aired on HBO.
 


By the time the case reached trial, decades after Berman’s death and years after The Jinx, Durst was frail and in poor health. The pandemic then delayed the trial further, shutting down proceedings just days after opening arguments. Durst missed the reading of the verdict because of possible COVID exposure. He returned to court for sentencing only to test positive a day later for COVID himself. His attorney told the LA Times he had been placed on a ventilator.As late as justice came in Berman’s murder, Durst never faced consequences in the death that prosecutors alleged started it all. In making their case that Durst murdered Berman, prosecutors argued that he believed she was going to implicate him to police in the killing of his first wife, Kathleen “Kathie” McCormack Durst, in 1982. By finding Durst guilty of the special circumstances of killing a witness, the jury signaled that they believed prosecutors’ arguments that Durst had also killed Kathie Durst, whose body has never been found. Advertisement     
 


Though Durst had not yet been charged in Kathie Durst's disappearance or death, much of the Berman trial had focused on her case. In their victim impact statements, Berman's family pleaded with Durst to tell the McCormack family where they could find her body.“In telling where Kathie is,” said Sareb Kaufman, who was raised by Berman, “you can find some small redemption.”Durst never did. And in November, prosecutors in New York indicted him for murder in connection with Kathie Durst's disappearance.Durst was born in New York on April 12, 1943, the eldest son of real estate magnate Seymour Durst and Bernice Herstein. His mother died at age 32, after reportedly jumping from the roof of the three-story family home in Scarsdale. Durst, then 7 years old, would later claim he had seen his mother jump that night, an account that has been disputed by his family.After graduating from Lehigh University in 1965 with a degree in economics, Durst attended UCLA. There he met Berman; their friendship lasted decades, until he killed her in 2000.In 1973, Durst married Kathie Durst, who would go on to disappear in January 1982, when she was a fourth-year medical student at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Days after she was last seen alive, a woman claiming to be Kathie Durst called in sick to the dean of the school — a call that LA prosecutors said was made by Berman to cover for her friend. Durst did not report his wife missing for nearly a week.Although Durst was never charged, suspicion followed him for decades. In 1999, police in Westchester, New York, reopened the case.Feeling the pressure of a renewed investigation, in April 2001, Durst moved to Galveston, Texas, where he lived in a boarding house in disguise as a woman. On Sept. 30 of that year, the dismembered remains of his neighbor Morris Black washed up in Galveston Bay. Durst later admitted fatally shooting Black and chopping up his body, but he said the killing was the accidental result of a struggle over a gun. A Galveston jury found him not guilty based on his claims of self-defense.As he admitted on the witness stand in the recent trial, though, he couldn’t be trusted to tell the truth under oath.“I did not kill Susan Berman,” Durst said, which was a lie. “But if I had, I would lie about it.”

154,The comedian and actor — famous for his roles on Full House and How I Met Your Mother — died on Sunday at age 65.,"Celebrities are mourning the loss of Bob Saget, who died yesterday. He was 65. On Sunday evening, the Orange County Sheriff's Office reported that Bob was found dead in his hotel room at the Ritz-Carlton Orlando. The cause of his death has not been confirmed, but officials said that there are no signs of foul play or drug use. “Earlier today, deputies were called to the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes for a call about an unresponsive man in a hotel room,” the officials wrote on Twitter. “The man was identified as Robert Saget and pronounced deceased on scene. Detectives found no signs of foul play or drug use in this case.” The legendary comedian and actor was perhaps best known for playing Danny Tanner on Full House in the '80s and '90s. He later reprised the role in 2016 for the show’s revival, Fuller House. Bob is survived by his wife, Kelly Rizzo, and three daughters — Aubrey, Lara, and Jennifer — who he shares with his first wife, Sherri Kramer. The comedian’s family issued a statement confirming the tragic news, spotlighting Bob's passion for performing live and “bringing people from all walks of life together with laughter.” “We are devastated to confirm that our beloved Bob passed away today. He was everything to us and we want you to know how much he loved his fans, performing live and bringing people from all walks of life together with laughter,” Saget’s family wrote. “Though we ask for privacy at this time, we invite you to join us in remembering the love and laughter that Bob brought to the world.” The news came shortly after he performed to a live audience on Saturday night in Jacksonville as part of his stand-up comedy tour. Several hours before his death, Bob tweeted about how much he’d loved that night’s show. Fellow comic, Pete Davidson, led tributes to the Full House star in the wake of his death. In a very rare public statement, Pete — who does not have his own social media accounts — spoke of Bob’s “kindness” and opened up about how the actor had helped him through struggles with his mental health. Pete's statement — which was shared on the Instagram account of his friend and fellow comic Dave Sirus — began with the 28-year-old describing Bob as ""one of the nicest men on the planet."" “When I was younger and several times throughout our friendship [Bob] helped me get through some rough mental health stuff,” the Saturday Night Live star said. “He stayed on the phone with my mom for hours trying to help in anyway he can — connecting us with doctors and new things we can try. He would check in on me and make sure I was okay,” he wrote. The statement concluded: “I love you Bob it was an honor to know you. Thank you for your kindness and friendship. My condolences to the family.” Like Pete, many other comedians spoke of Bob’s kindness, including Jim Carrey who praised his “big, big heart and wonderfully warped comic mind” in a tribute on Twitter. Fellow comics like Judd Apatow, Jon Stewart, Billy Crystal, Tiffany Haddish, Kathy Griffin, Chelsea Handler, and Ken Jeong also mourned the loss of their friend and colleague. A number of Full House actors have spoken out in memory of their costar, including the notoriously private Olsen twins. In a statement provided to People, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen — who shared the role of Michelle Tanner, first appearing on the show as infants — said they are “deeply saddened” by the death of their TV dad. “Bob was the most loving, compassionate and generous man. We are deeply saddened that he is no longer with us but know that he will continue to be by our side to guide us as gracefully as he always has,” the former child stars wrote in a joint statement. “We are thinking of his daughters, wife and family and are sending our condolences,” they added. Elsewhere, John Stamos — who famously played Uncle Jesse on the sitcom — expressed his “complete and utter shock,” telling fans he feels “broken” by the loss of his former castmate. “I am broken. I am gutted,” the actor wrote on Twitter. “I am in complete and utter shock. I will never ever have another friend like him. I love you so much Bobby.” Other Full House alumni like Dave Coulier and Candace Cameron Bure also shared tributes on Twitter. The latter — who played Bob’s eldest TV daughter, DJ Tanner — wrote that Bob was “one of the best human beings” she’d ever known. Despite Bob’s generation-spanning performances on Full House and Fuller House, he was better known to some for his essential role in How I Met Your Mother. Across all nine seasons of the hit sitcom, Bob lent his voice to the future version of Ted Mosby, who narrated each episode. Josh Radnor — who played Ted — shared a heartfelt thread of tweets to celebrate the life of the man who voiced his older self for nearly a decade. “We had a very special bond from Day 1, were never out of touch for long,” Josh wrote. “We found a way to grab dinner once a year, even after HIMYM wrapped. We went to see each other in our Broadway plays. We talked a lot about how to live a meaningful life amidst all the chaos.” He concluded the thread by expressing his gratitude for Bob’s friendship: “I’m endlessly grateful that HIMYM brought Bob Saget into my life. I’ll hear his voice in my head for the rest of my days.” Neil Patrick Harris — who played Barney Stinson on HIMYM — joined his costar in mourning the loss, describing Bob as “kind and generous and hilarious.” As well as those who worked with Bob on a professional basis, a number of his friends across the showbiz industry have penned moving tributes — including John Mayer, who was known to be an especially close friend to the actor. In a short but heartfelt statement on Instagram, John wrote: “I love you, Bob. I will never forget you. I will visit you often in my memories, and I hope I get to see you in my dreams. I will tell my kids about you. I’m taking you with me forever. I love you, Bob.” Other celebrities who've shown love for the beloved comedian include Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Whoopi Goldberg, Steve Martin, Andy Cohen, and BJ Novak."
155,"“There were moments where I was like, ‘God, I hate lying.’ I don’t like to lie and I’m not a good liar, but I kept framing it as a game.”","


Needless to say: Warning! There will be many spoilers for Spider-Man: No Way Home ahead!


 


If you didn’t know, the game Werewolf involves a group of people, some of whom are secret “werewolves” tasked with hiding their identity from the others. “Like anyone who’s played the game Werewolf knows, if you are the werewolf your heart kind of sinks because you know you have a stressful couple of hours ahead of you,” Andrew went on. “You’re gonna have to lie to your friends’ faces and try to convince them that you are not the bad guy in the game... But it was thrilling, actually.”
 


“I placed myself in that position of, ‘Well, what would I want to know? Would I want to be toyed with? Would I want to be lied to? Would I want to be kept on my toes guessing? Would I want to discover it when I went to the theater? Would I want to be guessing, guessing, guessing?’” he said.Refuting his own concerns, Andrew said: “I would want the actor to do an incredibly good job at convincing me he wasn’t in it. And then I would want to lose my mind in the theater when my instinct was proven right. That’s what I would want.”
 


“I worked so hard to keep it a secret that I was in Atlanta shooting,” he said. “All these leaks were happening, and I was like, ‘Oh, my God, guys, what the hell is going on? I’m working so hard here to stay secret, and then here’s an image of me with Tobey!’ And they’re like, ‘No, no, we’re gonna keep it quiet.’ ‘OK, I’ll keep denying it.’
 


“It’s been a rare experience to play that mass game of Werewolf with every single Spider-Man fan in the world,” he concluded.
 


For context: In The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Andrew's Peter Parker failed to save his love interest Gwen Stacy, who dies after falling from the clock tower. In No Way Home, however, he manages to save MJ from a similar fall — something that he called “a second chance at saving Gwen.” Advertisement     
 


“It was joyful, and a feeling of closure for me. There was so many unanswered questions for my Peter, where we left it. I got to step back in and get some healing for him,” he said.

156,"Just days after Kanye publicly begged Kim to take him back, Julia discussed their divorce in a podcast and admitted that she wanted the Kardashians to be her “family”. Two weeks later, she and Ye began dating.","If Julia Fox wasn’t on your radar in 2021 then I’m pretty sure she is in 2022 thanks to her and Kanye West’s very public new romance, which she confirmed in a detailed blog post last week. Kanye — who legally changed his name to Ye last year — had spent the weeks prior to meeting Julia begging his ex-wife Kim Kardashian to take him back after she filed for divorce in February, following six years of marriage. But after his efforts proved fruitless, he moved on with Uncut Gems actor Julia over New Year — and if the revelation that Ye surprised her with a “hotel suite full of clothes” on their second date wasn’t intense enough, it has now transpired that Julia considers herself a “die-hard, OG” fan of the Kardashians and admitted just two weeks before meeting Ye that she wanted to be a part of the family. To recap, Ye first broke his silence on his and Kim’s split in November, where he insisted he’d “never seen the divorce papers” in an episode of the Drink Champs podcast. He continued to make a string of similar claims that suggested he and Kim would reunite, before publicly begging his ex to take him back live onstage at his and Drake’s ""Free Larry Hoover"" concert in December. Reworking the lyrics of his 2010 hit “Runaway,” Ye repeatedly sang: “I need you to run right back to me, baby,” before adding, “more specifically, Kimberly.” The very next day, on Dec. 10, Kim submitted a request to court to be declared “legally single,” citing that “no counseling or reconciliation effort” can fix their marriage, and that Ye had not responded to multiple requests to officially “terminate” the relationship. She is rumored to have moved on with Saturday Night Live comic Pete Davidson, whom she was first linked to in October and jetted to the Bahamas with last week. After Kim’s petition to be “legally single” was filed, Ye reportedly decided to start “embracing the single life” as he was spotted in the company of various different women over the holiday season. But only one of the beauties managed to stick, with Julia and Ye embarking on a whirlwind romance after they met in Miami on New Year’s Eve. On Jan. 6, Julia confirmed that they are officially dating in a blog entry for Interview magazine, which recounted their relationship so far alongside a slew of very intimate photographs of the new couple. Confirming that they’d first met less than one week earlier, Julia wrote: “I met Ye in Miami on New Year’s Eve and it was an instant connection. His energy is so fun to be around. He had me and my friends laughing, dancing, and smiling all night.” She added that they’d then flown to New York to watch a play before going for dinner at her favorite restaurant, where Ye took it upon himself to direct a photo shoot, snapping shots of Julia while other diners apparently cheered from the sidelines, she said. And when the pair returned to their hotel suite, Julia found that Ye had filled it with racks of new clothes for her to wear. “After dinner Ye had a surprise for me. I mean, I’m still in shock,” Julia wrote. “Ye had an entire hotel suite full of clothes. It was every girl’s dream come true. It felt like a real Cinderella moment.” But fans were quickly struck with an eerie sense of déjà vu, recalling that Ye used a similar tactic to reinvent Kim at the very start of their relationship. Once they officially started dating in 2012, Ye decided to give Kim’s wardrobe and style a complete overhaul — famously reducing her to tears as he threw away any items that he didn’t approve of and presented her with a pile of new designer clothes. And this is all information that Julia is most likely aware of, considering she is a hardcore fan of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, where Kim has frequently spoken about Ye's behavior. In fact, Julia discussed her obsession with Kim’s entire family on her Forbidden Fruits podcast on Dec. 18 — two weeks before her and Ye’s fateful first meeting. Julia revealed that she can remember the exact moment Kim and Ye announced their divorce earlier in the year, and enthusiastically asked her cohost Niki Takesh: “Can we talk about the Kim and Kanye divorce? Wait, can we talk about Kim and Pete Davidson, though?” She and Niki go on to call themselves “OG, die-hard Kardashian fans” as they discussed the E! show coming to an end in June last year, with Julia admitting: “I’m gonna miss Keeping Up. I’ve been watching Keeping Up since it first came out in 2007, like when watching it was embarrassing. I like, wanted them to be my family.” Niki went on to add: “No, they are my family — I’m the biggest Kardashian stan and have been since 2007, nothing can stop that. It’s not even like, Oh my god, I’m obsessed with them. I don’t know how to explain my obsession with them.” Julia shared her agreement before musing: “You feel like you know them. It’s a different relationship, a deeper one, it’s like you’re happy for them when something good happens.” The pair then discussed Khloé Kardashian’s romance with Tristan Thompson, with Julia calling her “sensitive and kind” after recalling: “I remember watching the last season and she wasn’t back with Tristan yet in public; she wanted another baby but doing it with his sperm and her eggs. It’s like, babe, it’s OK — your kids don’t need to have the same father. Go find some good fucking guy.” And Julia's self-proclaimed love for all things Kardashian could explain why she's been recently caught liking several of Kim's Instagram posts while dating Ye. Julia follows Ye's ex on the social media platform, and eagle-eyed fans spotted her name under the likes for many of Kim’s posts — most recently a photo of Kim walking out of a hotel, which she shared four days ago alongside the caption: “The best is yet to be.” And if things go well between her and Ye, then Julia might just get her wish of being a part of Kim’s family — or at least stepmom to her kids."

People confirmed the news of the legendary comedian and actor's death, which was first reported by TMZ. He was 65 years old. The Orange County Sheriff's Office also confirmed that ""deputies were called to the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes for a call about an unresponsive man in a hotel room. The man was identified as Robert Saget & pronounced deceased on scene. Detectives found no signs of foul play or drug use in this case."" An accomplished comedian and actor, Saget was best known for his role as Danny Tanner in the sitcom Full House, which ran for eight seasons from 1987 to 1995. He also hosted America's Funniest Home Videos during the show's most iconic era, and he provided the voice for the ""future"" Ted Mosby on How I Met Your Mother. Even though Saget was associated with plenty of family-friendly media, he was equally known for his stand-up comedy, which mostly veered into adult-oriented territory. He also had a notorious cameo in the 1998 stoner comedy classic Half Baked. You can watch it below. Saget stayed in the public eye in the years leading up to his death — even appearing on The Masked Singer's fourth season, in which he competed as the ""Squiggly Monster.""

160,"""This is going to be one of the worst fires we have witnessed in modern times here in the city of New York,"" Mayor Eric Adams said.","


At least 17 people, eight of them children, have died and dozens are hospitalized in critical condition following a ""horrific"" apartment-complex fire in the Bronx, New York City officials said.The fire was caused by a malfunctioning electric space heater in a residence that spanned two floors of the apartment complex, FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro said in a press conference Sunday night. When those living in the apartment fled, they left the doors open, allowing smoke from the blaze to escape throughout the building. New York passed a law requiring large apartment buildings to have self-closing doors following an earlier deadly fire in the Bronx; it wasn't immediately clear how the door was able to remain open Sunday. Advertisement     ""The door to that apartment — unfortunately when the residents left — was left open; it did not close by itself,"" Nigro said. ""The smoke spread throughout the building, thus the tremendous loss of life and people fighting for their lives right now in hospitals all over the Bronx.""He added that the fire was contained, and smoke alarms in the building were operable.Officials initially said 19 people had died, but revised the number to 17 in a Monday press conference.
 


The fire broke out in the 19-story Twin Parks apartment building on East 181st Street at approximately 11 a.m.It was classified as a five-alarm fire, the most serious and dangerous category of blazes. Nigro said that more than 200 firefighters responded to the scene within minutes of the fire being reported.In the immediate aftermath, the fire commissioner confirmed 63 injuries, 32 of which required hospitalization.""This fire took its toll on the city,"" he said
 


Nigro added that given the number of people with serious injuries, the blaze was ""unprecedented in our city."" Firefighters ""found victims on every floor"" in cardiac and respiratory distress due to smoke inhalation, he said.Newly elected Mayor Eric Adams described the fire as ""a horrific, horrific, painful moment.""""The impact of this fire is going to really bring a level of pain and despair in this city,” Adams told the press. “This is going to be one of the worst fires we have witnessed in the city of New York in modern times.”Adams said that individuals affected by the fire who request government aid will not be turned over to immigration officials, regardless of their residency status. He said that many of those who lived in the building are Muslim immigrants from Gambia.""If you need assistance, your names will not be turned over to ICE or any other institution. We want people to be comfortable in coming forward, and it's imperative that we connect with those on the ground to make sure they get that message and that word out,"" Adams said. Advertisement     Camber Property Group, the organization that owns the building, said in a statement to the New York Times that they were ""devastated"" by the ""unimaginable loss of life caused by this profound tragedy.""""We are cooperating fully with the Fire Department and other city agencies as they investigate its cause, and we are doing all we can to assist our residents. Our thoughts are with the families and friends of those who lost their lives or were injured, and we are here to support them as we recover from this horrific fire.”The Bronx fire comes mere days after a fire at a Philadelphia apartment building that killed 12 people, eight of whom were children. The cause of that blaze remains under investigation, but the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that authorities believe a 5-year-old playing with a lighter set a Christmas tree on fire.BuzzFeed News reporter Kadia Goba contributed to this story.

161,The three new portraits of the Duchess of Cambridge will go on display around the UK and then hang in the National Portrait Gallery.,"


The royal family on Sunday released three new official portraits of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge (aka Kate Middleton), to mark her 40th birthday.The photos, taken by Italian fashion photographer Paolo Roversi, were captured in London's Kew Gardens in November 2020. The future queen consort is wearing custom-made gowns from British fashion house Alexander McQueen, which also designed her 2011 wedding dress. Advertisement     According to the BBC, the three portraits will at first go on display in locations across the UK ""with special meaning"" to the duchess before being permanently housed at the National Portrait Gallery, of which Kate is a patron. One image will hang in Berkshire, where the duchess was born and spent her childhood. The other will go to St. Andrews in Scotland, where Kate and William attended college and where they met. The third will go to Anglesey, where the royal couple lived immediately after their wedding.
 


Roversi, who is based in Paris, told the Guardian that working with Kate was a ""true honor"" and ""a moment of pure joy.""“I was moved by her warmth and friendly welcome and enchanted by her shining eyes that reflected the loveliness of her soul, and her smile showing the generosity of her heart.“It was a profound and rich experience for me, an unforgettable moment. I have met a wonderful person, a person who, with her positive energy, can bring hope to the whole world.”Four other portraits by Roversi are already on display in the National Portrait Gallery.
 


The pictures — two monochrome and one in color — show Kate in both casual and formal poses. The Queen loaned the duchess a pair of diamond earrings for the color portrait; she wears earrings that belonged to her mother-in-law, Princess Diana, in the others.In a tweet Sunday, Kate thanked the photographer and the National Portrait Gallery for the images and expressed her appreciation for the birthday wishes. The duchess was born Jan. 9, 1982.

A Chinese immigrant who was violently attacked months ago in New York City has died of his injuries, police said Saturday.Yao Pan Ma, 61, had been collecting bottles and cans in East Harlem on April 23, 2021, when a 49-year-old man ambushed him, knocking him to the ground and repeatedly kicking him in the head, leaving him bloodied and brutalized. In the months since, Ma had been in a coma and on a ventilator and was moved to hospice care in November, a spokesperson for his family previously told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement     Shortly after the incident, Jarrod Powell, 49, was arrested and charged with attempted murder and assault as a hate crime. During a deposition, Powell claimed a “Korean” man and a “Japanese” guy had robbed him, but “did not provide any details relating to the description of the perpetrators of the alleged robbery other than that they were Asian,” court records state.Following Ma's death on Dec. 31, the attack is being treated as a homicide, police said.Ma and his wife emigrated from China to the US in Nov. 18 and moved in with her parents in Harlem after losing their Chinatown apartment to a fire, the family's spokesperson said. Back in China, where the couple's children and grandchildren remained, Ma had been a talented chef. In New York, he got a job cooking and washing dishes at a restaurant in Chinatown, but lost it when the pandemic shuttered restaurants across the city.The family struggled to make ends meet after that; Ma did not qualify for unemployment benefits, and his in-laws received less than $1,000 in Social Security income. To support all four of them, Ma and his wife began collecting empty bottles and cans, living off the 5-cents-apiece refunds. Advertisement     After he was attacked while gathering the recyclables, Ma's wife was too afraid to go out and continue doing so. She found work as a home health aide for a time but is now unemployed again. During her visits to the hospital to see her husband, she would play Chinese opera music for him, uncertain but hopeful he might be able to hear it.Ma is one of the many victims in a wave of anti-Asian violence that has swept the US during the pandemic. Like him, a number of older Asian people, many of them immigrants, have been severely injured or even killed in similar unprovoked beatings. In March, six Asian women were killed in a string of shootings at spas in Georgia.According to a recent report by the organization Stop AAPI Hate, there have been more than 10,000 reported anti-Asian hate incidents in the US since March 2020, 16% of which were physical assaults.

In Ho’s debut book of fiction, two childhood best friends growing up in Los Angeles fall in and out of love, navigate relationships with estranged family members, and deal with casual racism in these linked short stories about friendship over time. —Tomi Obaro
 


A frazzled single mother leaves her child alone at home for a few hours only to run into trouble with the state, which sends her to an institution to teach her how to sufficiently love her daughter in this buzzy debut novel about the pressures of modern motherhood. —T.O.
 


The author of A Little Life returns with yet another doorstopper (To Paradise is a whopping 720 pages). Set in three alternative versions of the US, the novel focuses primarily on three characters, two of whom have the same name. The first section is a queer Edith Wharton–esque tale of a young man named David who agrees to an arranged marriage to an older man even though he’s in love with someone else. In the second section, a character also named David lives in 1993 Manhattan during the AIDS epidemic and cares for his ailing older partner while avoiding anything to do with his father and his family back in Hawaii. The third section centers on a woman trapped in a dystopian future, still reeling from the effects of a devastating pandemic. —T.O.
 


In 2016, Schulz’s father died, mere months after meeting her partner and eventual wife for the first time. In three sections, “Lost,” “Found,” and “And,” Schulz muses about the mundanity of grief, the rapture of true love, and the queasy coexistence of both forces at the same time. I read a galley of this book over the holidays and couldn't stop thinking about its deep insight into the fleeting beauty of existence. —T.O.
 


Disclosure: Attenberg is an acquaintance of mine who blurbed my own upcoming book, but even if she were a total stranger, I know I would have enjoyed this memoir. Attenberg, the author of the bestseller The Middlesteins and six other works of fiction, turns to nonfiction for the first time with this autobiography about her dogged commitment to writing. From growing up as an awkward adolescent in suburban Chicago to having a traumatizing experience in college to gallivanting from apartment to apartment in Seattle and Williamsburg, she writes about charting her way through adulthood unconventionally, wedded only to her art. —T.O.
 


The author of 2017’s deadpan debut Chemistry returns to bookshelves with this similarly offbeat story of an ICU doctor dealing with the aftermath of her father’s death. Joan is an extremely competent but somewhat antisocial thirtysomething working at a hospital in New York City. When her father dies of a stroke in China, she takes 48 hours off to attend the funeral and then is back to work. But a mandatory wellness break forces Joan to spend time with her mother and brother. Wang’s sense of humor makes this both a page-turner and a poignant reflection on the familial ruptures caused by immigrating. —T.O.
 


Morrison’s only published short story is reissued here with an illuminating foreword by Zadie Smith. Recitatif centers on two girls of different races, Roberta and Twyla, who are sent to a state shelter. Crucially, though, we are never told who is Black and who is white. Like much of Morrison’s work, this story is a deceptively simple and intricate indictment of the ludicrousness of racism. —T.O.
 


The popular pop culture writer tackles a decade that feels like a lifetime ago now, back when the monoculture was alive and well and Seinfeld was the most popular show on television. —T.O.
 


With a singular sense of wryness and ribaldry, Lavery charts the course of her gender transition. —T.O.
 


Heti’s breakthrough novel, 2010’s How Should a Person Be?, influenced countless writers and set the stage for our current autofiction boom. Her latest once again breaks the mold of what a novel can be. The plot and setting are abstract; God creates three kinds of people: bird, fish, and bear, the first of which spawns Mira, the protagonist we follow throughout the novel. But questions that have shown up in Heti’s prior work, namely around the problems of living and what it means to be an artist, are still very much at the center. —Karolina Waclawiak
 


In the second book of James’ trilogy about a mythical African kingdom, Sogolon — the ancient witch who battles the protagonist, Tracker, in the first book, Black Leopard, Red Wolf — takes center stage. —T.O.
 


Before Beyoncé tapped this Somali British poet to write the poetry for her visual album Lemonade, Shire was already a prolific writer, with two chapbooks, Teaching My Mother How to Give Birth and Her Blue Body, under her belt. Now she’s publishing her first full-length poetry collection, which focuses, like much of her work, on the trauma of forced migration, familial violence, and secrets. This is a collection that merits slow and careful reading. —T.O.
 


Inspired by Robert Mugabe’s fall from power in 2017 and George Orwell’s classic fable Animal Farm, Bulawayo satirizes the dysfunctional politics that curse so many African nations in this long-awaited sophomore effort after her 2013 Booker finalist debut, We Need New Names. —T.O.
 


In this inventive debut, a disparate group of social outcasts get by in the city of Lagos, even as the criminalization of homosexuality dampens their ability to live freely. Some characters are humans, others are spirits, others seem to shift between the two. Like the work of fellow Nigerian writers Lesley Nneka Arimah and Akwaeke Emezi (who incidentally blurbed this book), these stories eschew strict realism for magical writing in both the literal and figurative sense. —T.O.
 


Vuong’s second full-length poetry collection grapples with the aftermath of his mother’s death in poems that memorably evoke the stunning immensity of loss. —T.O.
 


Picking up where her 2010 Pulitzer-winning collection A Visit From the Goon Squad left off, Egan once again hopscotches characters, countries, and years in this book about a technological invention called Own Your Unconscious that allows people to upload their memories to the cloud. The privacy implications of such an idea prompt a swift backlash. Using the inventiveness that made A Visit From the Goon Squad such a delight, Egan delivers another formally creative novel. —T.O.
 


Mandel has always excelled at drawing connections between disparate characters who seem, at first glance, utterly unrelated to each other. Sea of Tranquility is arguably her most ambitious book yet in that regard. A teenager sets sail for the wilds of Canada, a novelist lives in a moon colony, and a detective investigates a series of crimes in the ominously named Night City. Science fiction lovers will not be disappointed. —T.O.
 


Painful cramps and mood swings have always been integral components of Caldwell’s periods. But in her 30s, the symptoms appear to worsen. When the mood swings begin to threaten her burgeoning romantic relationship, Caldwell gets a medical diagnosis that confirms she has premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Armed with this information, she talks to different people about their own painful periods while also charting her experiences with love and the pressures on women in their 30s to “settle down.” —T.O.
 


Though my relationship with Abdelmahmoud, my BuzzFeed News colleague, could perhaps best be described as “gently antagonistic,” I can’t say enough nice things about his debut book. Son of Elsewhere is described as “memoir in pieces,” and indeed it gives gorgeous if sometimes brutal flashes from Abdelmahmoud’s life. Each essay covers a wide range — stories about Blackness, immigration, fatherhood, wrestling fanfiction, war, and the glory of suburban Canadian highways— but his writing always pulls you in and makes you stay, even if it’s painful, even if it hurts. —Scaachi Koul
 


In the follow-up to Batuman’s 2017 novel The Idiot, a Pulitzer finalist, Selin, a Harvard undergraduate in a confusing situationship with a grad student named Ivan, is entering her sophomore year. She’s still naively confounded by the ways of the adult world and seeks solace in fiction, even as Ivan’s ex and the technological advances of the ’90s bear down. —T.O.
 


Perrotta brings back his iconic character Tracy Flick for his newest novel. Set in the #MeToo era, the book explores themes of redemption and forgiveness as Flick finds herself back in high school, but this time navigating power dynamics as a single mother and assistant principal vying for the newly vacated top spot. Chock-full of unforgettable characters and Perrotta’s signature wit and pathos, this is a welcome return to a world rife with complex moral dilemmas. —K.W.
 


The Chos are an upwardly mobile Korean American family faced with sudden humiliation when son Jacob is filmed trying to cross the DMZ to visit family in North Korea. They don’t know that he’s been possessed by the ghost of his late grandfather. As the family grapples with the fallout of his actions, they’re forced to confront their own trauma. —T.O.
 


Fresh off the heels of the publication of Empire of Pain, Keefe’s Sackler family exposé, the popular New Yorker staff writer is back with this collection of some of his reporting for the magazine, from his profile of the late Anthony Bourdain to the global hunt for El Chapo. —T.O.
 


This marvelous debut novel from Obaro, BuzzFeed News’ deputy culture editor, follows the decadeslong friendship of Enitan, Zainab, and Funmi as they prepare for the lavish wedding of Funmi’s daughter, Destiny. Set in Nigeria, the story begins as the friends are reunited in the present day before delving into how they first met. Against the backdrop of student protests in the 1980s, these very different women forge bonds that are tested by love affairs and tragedy. It’s an unforgettable and complex portrait of female friendship. —K.W.
 


The former BuzzFeed Books founder’s intimate debut essay collection spans Fitzgerald’s childhood in Boston, precarious adolescence in rural Massachusetts, class-defined high school years in a wealthy boarding school, and adulthood in San Francisco while tackling timely topics like masculinity and body image, class, addiction, and what we inherit from our parents. Equal parts illuminating and poignant, Fitzgerald’s essays attempt to untangle what it means to be a man in this world and in his own body. —K.W.
 


Hamid’s latest novel following the success of 2017’s Exit West is a Kafkaesque mindbender. One day, a man named Anders discovers that his skin has turned dark and he no longer recognizes himself. How he handles the fallout becomes the central concern of this book. —T.O. ●BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them.

164,"brb, unfollowing everyone","


This is an excerpt from Please Like Me, BuzzFeed News’ newsletter about how influencers are battling for your attention. You can sign up here.I’ve recently noticed a trend reemerge among celebrities and influencers that I can’t stop thinking about: unfollowing everyone on Instagram.Some refer to it as entering their Reputation era, a nod to Taylor Swift, who famously unfollowed everyone in 2017 and posted snakes on her feed to promote her post-cancellation album. Five years later, her following count still sits at zero. Other Gen Z celebs have also embraced the unfollow, such as Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo. Then this week, YouTuber and influencer Emma Chamberlain, who has over 14 million followers, purged her Insta account to follow no one. Advertisement     It feels like a blue checkmark is no longer enough for celebrities to prove their social media power. Instead, it’s following zero people that elevates them to god level.During an interview on Capital Breakfast, a UK radio show, Swift explained that wiping her profile clean and unfollowing people was in protest to how the media monitored her every move via social media.“I’m starting to realize that if I didn’t wish one of my friends a happy birthday on Instagram, there would literally be articles saying like, ‘Unsquadded: She’s no longer friends with so-and-so!’ And I’d literally be at the person’s birthday party with them and because I hadn’t posted,” Swift said. “I kind of reject this idea that if you didn’t see it on the Internet it didn’t happen.""For Chamberlain, it might be a way for her to spend less time online — something she has been vocal about wanting to do. She’s already deleted her Twitter and TikTok accounts. Fans noticed and called it “queen behavior.""
 


After a few days at zero, Chamberlain started following one Insta account: her own coffee brand.The unfollow move makes sense for celebrities. With constant eyes on Rodrigo’s Instagram and when she would or wouldn’t unfollow her ex-boyfriend Joshua Bassett, unfollowing everyone probably eliminated a possible headline. There’s also the perceived power it gives these celebrities. No one is good enough for Beyoncé to follow; her count has been zero since day one. Even Oprah only follows three accounts for the companies she owns or does business with. Ed Sheeran follows his brand’s account and the restaurant he opened in 2019.I reached out to Anna Russett, a YouTuber and product specialist at YouTube, who unfollowed everyone on Instagram in 2018 after realizing she was following too many people she didn’t know. Plus, as a vlogger with more than 88,000 subscribers, she knew some of her fans would follow everyone she was following, including her boss or her nonpublic friends. Advertisement     “That was strange,” Russett told me. “Some people just want a way to be closer to your life in some way when you create content, and that was a couple of people’s ways of doing that.”She still has a finsta, which she uses to follow some influencers she likes, but unfollowing everyone has given her more agency, she said. Instead of someone’s post popping up on her phone, she has to seek it out, meaning she spends less time on the app.
 


For Russett, Swift, and Rodrigo, using Instagram as a creator rather than as a consumer isn’t that wild of an idea. Social media is a way for them to sell themselves and their art. But on Facebook, where someone has to be your friend to see your posts, unfriending everyone is almost like disappearing.Stephen, who declined to disclose his last name, told BuzzFeed News that after his grandmother died in October, he began to reevaluate whom he was sharing information with online.“I started to have a frustration about sharing parts of my life with all the strangers I’ve collected throughout the course of my life but not being able to share it with a close family member who’s no longer around,” he said.Stephen, who is 24, has been on Facebook for half of his life, which makes his skin crawl. So he deleted more than 1,000 Facebook friends, leaving only his brother and boyfriend. In a way, he was reinventing himself, but he realized there was a darker side to his actions.“I was trying to erase myself, for lack of a better phrasing of it,” Stephen said. “It really felt like I was trying to kill myself off of it in a way.”Unfriending everyone gave him some anxiety, so he slowly added close friends and family members back — but now that he has fewer Facebook friends, he’s on the website less.Chamberlain seems to want the same. When she deleted her TikTok, she said on her podcast that it was a “life-changing experience.”Maybe unfollowing everyone on Instagram is a way of forcing herself to use the app less, like how many people make a New Year’s resolution to cut down on their social media intake.“It seemed like TikTok kept me entertained in bed to the point where I would stay in bed so much longer,” she said. “Within the first few days of deleting TikTok, I stopped laying in bed so much because I would get so bored. It forced me to get up, and I felt like I was doing more chores.”Until there’s a way to mass unfollow people, it’s too much of a chore for me to unfollow more than 2,000 accounts. I would rather just keep scrolling.

167,"Kanye famously replaced Kim Kardashian’s entire wardrobe at the start of their relationship nearly 10 years ago — which begs the question, is history about to repeat itself?","Welcome to the next chapter of the Kimye divorce saga, starring Julia Fox. The 31-year-old actor — who is best known for her breakout performance in Adam Sandler’s Uncut Gems — appears to have bagged herself the highly coveted role of the newest muse of Ye (formerly known as Kanye West). If you’re wondering how we got here, you’re not alone. Allow me to explain. So, if you’ve been ~keeping up~ with Kim Kardashian West and Ye over the past few months, you’ll be well aware that Ye has made no secret of the fact that his sights have been firmly set on a reunion. While Kim was hanging out with her rumored beau, Pete Davidson, Ye pretty much spent the entire month of November publicly begging for her to reconsider their divorce. In fact, even as recently as Dec. 9, the father of four was proudly singing for his soon-to-be-ex-wife to “run right back” to him while performing on stage in front of 70,000 people. In light of this, fans were left understandably shocked after the rapper was spotted hanging out with a number of different women over the course of the festive period. Reportedly “embracing the single life,” Ye spent time partying in Belize, Houston, and eventually Miami, where he celebrated over the New Year weekend. Which is where we meet Julia Fox. The duo were first linked after they stepped out for dinner in Miami on New Year’s Day. And despite reports at the time that the date was “nothing serious,” Julia and Ye were spotted on a second outing just a few days later. After relocating to New York City for their next date — which involved a Broadway show and another romantic dinner — Page Six reported that the two were officially dating. And now, putting any speculation to rest, Julia confirmed the romance herself in a blog entry she wrote for Interview Magazine on Jan. 6 — less than one week after we’re told they first met. The brief but detailed article — which is accompanied by a slew of very intimate images of the two — begins with Julia explaining that, as we presumed, she and Ye first met in Miami on New Year’s Eve, right before their first date on Jan. 1. “I met Ye in Miami on New Year’s Eve and it was an instant connection. His energy is so fun to be around. He had me and my friends laughing, dancing, and smiling all night,” she wrote, before going on to explain how they wound up in NYC days later. “We decided to keep the energy going and fly back to New York City to see Slave Play,” she revealed. “Ye’s flight landed at six and the play was at seven and he was there ON TIME. I was impressed.” “After the play we chose to do dinner at Carbone which is one of my favorite restaurants. Obviously,” she added. Julia also explained that — in true Ye style — the Yeezy founder took it upon himself to direct a photoshoot inside the restaurant, snapping shots of Julia while other diners apparently cheered from the sidelines. “At the restaurant, Ye directed an entire photo shoot for me while people dined! The whole restaurant loved it and cheered us on while it was happening,” she said. And if the impromptu photoshoot wasn’t strange enough, here’s where things start to get a little weird. The Uncut Gems star went on to reveal that after finishing up with dinner, the two headed back to a hotel suite which had been packed out with racks of clothes for her to wear. “After dinner Ye had a surprise for me. I mean, I’m still in shock,” Julia wrote. “Ye had an entire hotel suite full of clothes. It was every girl’s dream come true. It felt like a real Cinderella moment.” “I don’t know how he did it, or how he got all of it there in time. But I was so surprised. Like, who does things like this on a second date? Or any date!” she concluded. If you read that passage and felt a sudden pang of déjà vu, that’s probably because we’ve seen this scenario before. Despite Julia’s evident surprise at the gesture, Ye used a similar tactic once before to woo (or rather, reinvent) Kim Kardashian at the start of their relationship. If you need reminding, Ye took it upon himself to lead a complete overhaul of Kim’s image shortly after they officially started dating in 2012. Starting with her style, Ye called upon the help of his stylist, who assisted him in updating Kim’s entire closet, disposing of anything they didn’t like and replacing it with ~Ye-approved~ items. After reportedly throwing out over 250 pairs of shoes — and reducing Kim to tears in the process — Ye presented her with an entirely new wardrobe filled with designer clothes he’d picked out to inaugurate the new-and-improved Kim. Nearly a decade later — the 250 pairs of lost shoes now ancient history — and Ye has literally been credited with “revolutionizing” Kim’s style and overall image. Which prompts the question: Is history about to repeat itself? Interestingly, even before Julia revealed that he had surprised her with the new clothes, some fans were already speculating that Ye had been styling her for their dates. Sporting a number of Balenciaga ensembles, Julia’s date night attire was suspiciously reminiscent of the countless looks from the same designer that we’ve come to expect from Kim over recent months. Clearly unfazed by the Kim K comparisons, Julia closed out her Interview Mag post by hinting that she’s excited for the future of her relationship with Ye. “Everything with us has been so organic,” she told readers. “I don’t know where things are headed but if this is any indication of the future I’m loving the ride.” Like Julia, we also can’t predict where the future will take this unlikely duo. But, if Ye's generous wardrobe donation is anything to go by, there's a chance he could be in it for the long run."

169,"Some people are trying throat swabs for their at-home rapid tests, but experts warn against that.","


People are posting on social media that they’re getting positive COVID results after swabbing their throat for an at-home rapid test rather than doing the recommended nasal swab.In a TikTok with more than a million views, a reporter demonstrated that when she swabbed her nose for an at-home rapid COVID-19 antigen test, the result was negative.But when Alison Hall swabbed her throat minutes later and did the same kind of test, it came back positive. She also later confirmed a positive result with a PCR test.“Moral of the story — consider swabbing your throat in addition to your nose for early detection and get a backup PCR test to confirm,” she says in the video.#SwabYourThroat also trended on Twitter, as multiple people posted about testing positive to COVID with a throat swab after negative nasal swabs. Manufacturers recommend nasal swabs, however, and all the data on how well the tests work are based on using it as instructed. As Omicron sends the world to record levels of COVID infections, and long testing lines make it harder to get PCR tests, people are often relying on at-home rapid tests to see if they’re infected. A sore throat is a trademark Omicron symptom and many people report it being their first indication of having the virus. Advertisement     But experts don’t endorse throat swabbing — even if some of them are doing it themselves on their own home tests. For one, the FDA does not recommend using tests incorrectly.Nam Tran, an associate clinical professor in the department of pathology and laboratory medicine who oversees COVID-19 testing efforts at UC Davis Health, told BuzzFeed News that he does not recommend swabbing the throat because a lot of things could affect it, such as food in the throat. Even drinking something beforehand could cause the virus to wash down and not appear on the test.He acknowledged that it was possible a throat swab result may come back positive earlier. Rapid tests are more likely to give a false negative early on, which may be why people want to swab their throat.“There’s a biological factor, meaning the virus may replicate more early on in the throat and expand thereafter,” he said. However, it’s not as simple as just using a throat swab to collect it.“There’s a technological factor,” he said. “How good are you at collecting a nasal swab versus an oral swab?”A throat swab is more complicated to perform. “Technique matters because you can have a perfect test and if you just swab loosely or lightly because you have a sensitive nose or sensitive mouth, you might not get enough virus for your test to detect it anyway irrespective of where the virus lives,” Tran said.If someone has symptoms of COVID-19 but gets a negative result on an at-home antigen test, Tran said to go to the doctor or to get a PCR test because it’s important to test over time.“At some point, the viral concentration goes up high enough where the test will pick it up anyway,” he said. “But if you are symptomatic, test negative, out of the abundance of precaution, you should still mask up, you should still try to stay away from people.” Advertisement     Michael Mina, chief science officer of eMed, said during a Zoom webinar Thursday that throat swabbing for COVID-19 is still so new, many people might not know how to do it, but he’s hopeful people will learn.“We know throat swabs can work, but saliva is different,” he said. “Throat swabs might be working because they’re mixing with saliva in terms of where you’re putting your swab in your oropharynx or your cheeks depending on how you’re doing it.”He said antigen tests have always been less sensitive than PCR tests, but it’s not that antigen tests aren’t detecting Omicron, it’s just that people are becoming infectious with this variant before the virus has a chance to grow into the nose. Like Tran, Mina said symptomatic people should assume they have COVID-19.Mina said swabbing the throat can be dangerous, so people should follow the FDA guidance, but he acknowledged the FDA also has to exist within tight guidelines that sometimes have more practical than scientific origins.“I think oftentimes people assume that the way it’s been authorized by the FDA is always optimal, like the spacing with the vaccines,” Mina said. “The three to four weeks was not optimal, that was out of convenience to get the clinical trials done quickly. But then because that’s the data that’s given to the FDA, that’s what the FDA has to authorize because they don’t have other data to suggest otherwise even if the science says a different picture.”He admitted he does swab his throat when he’s using an at-home test, but if others do the same, they should do so at their own risk.Blythe Adamson, a health economist and pharmacoepidemiologist serving as principal quantitative scientist at Flatiron Health, told BuzzFeed News that she thinks as soon as scientists believe throat swabbing is safe and effective, the FDA will most likely move quickly to authorize it.In a statement provided to BuzzFeed News, an FDA spokesperson said COVID-19 tests should be used as authorized.“The FDA has noted safety concerns regarding self-collection of throat swabs, as they are more complicated than nasal swabs – and if used incorrectly, can cause harm to the patient. The CDC recommends that throat swabs be collected by a trained healthcare provider.”On Twitter, the FDA said that they don't have any data that suggests throat swabs are accurate.

171,"""Dancing and having captions answering a comment is in line with content I've always created,"" said Whitney Leavitt","


A mom who went viral on TikTok for dancing next to her newborn as he received supplemental oxygen in a hospital said she posted the video just to share her son's health condition.""I would say the mistake I made was not giving enough context of the situation,"" the 28-year-old mom of two, Whitney Leavitt, told BuzzFeed News.The captions explained that her son Liam had been diagnosed with RSV, a common respiratory condition for which some infants need to receive oxygen via a nasal cannula.In the video, Leavitt dances next to her son as Kendrick Lamar's ""Love"" plays, hitting every beat.People online were confused and angry, insinuating that Leavitt was careless to dance beside her child in a hospital. The tabloids, including the Mail Online and the Sun, also picked up the story. A reposted video on Twitter has 4.7 million views. Advertisement     
 



 


""It was really bad, people were telling me to end my life, they wished my family would die,"" said Leavitt, who took down the video following the hate messages.She found out about the backlash on her second day in the hospital.""I felt like I had completely lost control to clear up the context of everything of why I made the video and the reason of what motivated me to make the video and I feel like people completely took it out of context,"" Leavitt said.She added that the reason she made the video was because people were asking about his condition while Liam was in the hospital and all her videos involve dancing.""Dancing and having captions answering a comment is in line with content I've always created,"" she said.
 


Leavitt's husband called her about the video going viral and said that it was everywhere. ""He was like, 'I think we need to take it down,' and it wasn't until that point that I looked it up and it had gone everywhere,"" she said. Advertisement     Like many people, Leavitt said she joined TikTok out of boredom from quarantining and started her account as something fun to do.At first, she began posting relatable mom content and memes. Then, when she got pregnant with her second child, Leavitt decided to start dancing again.
 


""I don't know why I didn't do this from the beginning because I enjoy it so much,"" she said.Leavitt danced at a competitive studio for years and then stopped when she became pregnant with her first child.She said that her second pregnancy was great and a lot different than the first one, which she found very hard. ""I wonder if dancing maybe helped — brought up my spirit,"" she added.Meanwhile, Liam is now doing great and doesn't need oxygen support.""He's awesome. He's healthy. He's sleeping horribly. But other than that, he's doing great,"" Leavitt said.
 


According to the Daily Dot, Leavitt's video got 1.6 million views before she took it down. Since then, the video has actually started a meme in which people dance to the same song with hypothetical situations.For example, there's one where someone dances with captions about their court date, or another where someone dances while the captions say they have been evicted because they didn't know they were supposed to pay rent every month. Advertisement     Leavitt wasn't aware that she'd started a mini trend, but she said that since the video hit the tabloids, she has started to think more about her content.""I don't want people to think that I didn't learn from this, because I definitely did,"" she said.

The three white men who chased down and fatally shot Ahmaud Arbery on a Georgia road were sentenced to life in prison Friday.Travis McMichael and his father, Greg McMichael, were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole after the judge said their actions showed little remorse for the chilling murder of the 25-year-old Black man.""This was a killing,"" Judge Timothy Walmsley said. ""It was callous.""Neighbor William “Roddie” Bryan was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, but only after serving 30 years.Walmsley handed down the sentence after Arbery's parents and sister made their case for the harshest sentence, arguing that the three men killed him when they couldn't scare him away from their neighborhood.""This wasn't a case of mistaken identity or mistaken fact,"" Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, told the court. ""They chose to target my son because they didn't want him in their community. They chose to treat him differently than other people who frequently visited their community. And when they couldn't sufficiently scare or intimidate him, they killed him."" Advertisement     Her comment appeared to have struck the judge, who cited the statement as he handed out the sentence for the three men.""He was killed because individuals here in this courtroom took the law into their own hands,"" he said.The McMichaels and Bryan were convicted of felony murder in November for the daytime killing that was captured on video. Arbery, 25, was shot on Feb. 23, 2020, in Brunswick, Georgia, while he was running on a two-lane road.The McMichaels had told police there had been break-ins in the neighborhood and that they began to chase Arbery in their truck. The men then confronted him. After a struggle with a shotgun, Travis fired at Arbery, killing him.Despite the footage and admissions from the three men that they had chased down Arbery before Travis McMichael shot and killed him, no arrests were made for more than two months. The leaking of the video drew public outrage and cast skepticism on how local authorities were handling the investigation. A former prosecutor handling the case has since been charged with violating her oath of office and obstructing the investigation.""These brutal crimes nearly went unpunished because of the deep corruption that pervades so many of our systems,"" said Ben Crump, an attorney representing Arbery's family. ""But because of the video, and the public cries for accountability, Ahmaud's killers have finally been held to account — first by the jury and in today's sentencing.""Prosecutors on Friday argued the three men should be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, and Arbery's parents issued emotional pleas agreeing with the harshest sentence.""When I close my eyes, I see his execution in my mind, over and over,"" Arbery's father, Marcus Arbery, said. ""His killers should spend the rest of their lives thinking about what they did and what they took from us, and they should do it from behind bars because me and my family, we have to live with his death for the rest of their lives.""As he handed down his sentencing, Walmsley pointed out what he called ""chilling"" scenes from the video, which he said appeared to point to the defendants' demeanor immediately during and after the killing — factors he took into account in his decision. Advertisement     One of the scenes that stuck out in his mind, he said, was when Travis McMichael points the shotgun at Arbery.""When I thought about this, I thought from a lot of different angles, and I kept going back to the terror that must have been in the mind of the young man running through Satilla Shores,"" Walmsley said.The judge said he was also struck by the moment in the video immediately after Arbery is shot.""After Ahmaud Arbery fell, the McMichaels turned their backs,"" he said. ""They walked away.""
 


Defense attorneys asked for a lighter sentence of life with the possibility of parole, pointing to the men's lack of criminal history and what they said were lives of community service before the 2020 killing.""Greg McMichael is a good man,"" defense attorney Laura Hogue told the court, pointing out his service in the military and as an investigator with the prosecutor's office. ""He's not a perfect person, none of us are, but he's lived a good life, a life dedicated to service, and that does count for something.""Bryan's attorney, Kevin Gough, asked the court for an even lighter sentence than the mandatory minimum, arguing that, unlike the McMichaels, Bryan had expressed remorse over Arbery's death.""Whether it's part of the record or not, he expressed remorse over Mr. Arbery's death even before he was arrested on national television,"" Gough said. ""The Arbery family has not accepted that, and they don't have to, your honor, and we can understand why.""According to Gough, Bryan said that he wished he hadn't left his front porch and told one of the police officers he sometimes wished he had hit Arbery with his truck to prevent the shooting from taking place. Advertisement     But prosecutor Linda Dunikoski argued for all three to be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, saying they were taking acts of vigilantism by arming themselves to confront Arbery.Dunikoski took issue in particular to Hogue comparing the men's actions to those of a neighborhood watch, telling the judge that members of a neighborhood watch are there to monitor and be good witnesses.""That's what neighborhood watch is supposed to be, not somebody running after people in a residential neighborhood,"" she said.She asked the judge, in handing down his decision, to take into account Travis McMichael's demeanor on the stand when he testified.""[Travis McMichael] said that was the worst day of his life,"" she said, raising her voice. ""Well, how did that work out for Ahmaud Arbery?""Greg McMichael, Dunikoski said, has at times used his past as a law enforcement officer for his defense and, at others, seemed to ignore his training and experience for actions that would benefit him.It was Greg McMichael who in May 2020, she said, took the video of the fatal shooting, gave it to his attorney, and leaked it, hoping it would help his case.She said he had ignored his law enforcement training and released evidence in an ongoing investigation.""He believed it was going to exonerate him,"" she said. ""He and his son believe they didn't do anything wrong, and that is a lack of remorse or empathy.""

173,"“Pediatric hospitalizations are at the highest rate compared to any prior point in the pandemic,” warned the CDC’s director.","


CDC Director Rochelle Walensky warned on Friday that pediatric hospitals are seeing record numbers of children with COVID-19, as the Omicron variant surges nationwide.US coronavirus cases are currently higher than they’ve ever been, averaging around 600,000 new cases reported daily (itself an undercount), with hospitalization rates that have increased for people of all ages, according to Walensky, who briefed reporters on Friday. More than 1,200 people a day are dying of COVID-19 nationwide. Advertisement     “While children still have the lowest rate of hospitalization of any group, pediatric hospitalizations are at the highest rate compared to any prior point in the pandemic,” Walensky said. “Sadly, we are seeing the rates of hospitalization increasing for children 0 to 4, children who are not yet currently eligible for COVID-19 vaccination.”As of Jan. 1, the rate for COVID-19 hospitalizations among children under 4 was 4.3 cases per 100,000. That’s almost four times higher than it is among kids 5 to 17, who are eligible for vaccination, according to Walensky, and more than twice the hospitalization rate seen in this age group at the same time last year. She added that CDC data does show that children above the age of 4 are more likely to be in the hospital if they are unvaccinated.Walensky pointed out that some unknown number of these cases are incidental — children who test positive when they are hospitalized for non-COVID reasons. Many of the case reports of children come from asymptomatic kids who enter the hospital for elective procedures or other illnesses, she added, complicating the picture for epidemiologists trying to figure out risks for kids.George Rutherford, professor of epidemiology and pediatrics at UCSF, said these numbers show that COVID is widespread, is infecting children, and some proportion of them will be hospitalized. “Hospitalizations are going up. There's no reason to think that they wouldn't go up in children,” he said, adding that “children don't seem to be as unsusceptible to this as they have been to earlier strains.” Advertisement     But he thinks it’s too early to say that the proportion of infected children requiring hospitalization is growing nationally, partly because the CDC data is mostly from the northeastern region. Not knowing how many of these hospital cases are incidental makes the numbers even harder to interpret. “I've seen in London, where they actually do publish these data, that a third of COVID hospitalizations are incidental findings,” he added.Still, he said that COVID-19 is a serious disease for children, and protecting them while Omicron surges across the country is paramount.“In 2020 COVID was the seventh leading cause of death in children in the United States,” Rutherford said. “It is a big deal. And people who pooh-pooh it and say 'oh, it's no big deal' are blind to facts.”Masking in school and other indoor settings is helpful, he said, but what’s most important is for parents to try to ensure that everyone their child is in contact with is vaccinated and boosted (if they are eligible).It remains an open question whether Omicron is any more likely to lead to more severe disease in kids than other variants. This did not happen with Delta, Walensky said. “We are seeing a rise in hospitalizations, both because they are coming in with COVID but also because they're screening in for COVID,"" she said. ""[We] have not yet seen a signal that there is any increased severity in this age demographic.”Throughout the briefing, Walensky also defended the CDC against complaints that recent changes to protocols for isolating or quarantining after an infection, down to five days without symptoms, were confusing to the public or subject to disagreement from outside experts.“This virus has changed, and it's constantly throwing up curveballs,” Walensky said in response. As this virus changes, the CDC will have to change its guidance when working with state and local public health “to provide recommendations that are most feasible and can be implemented in communities across the country,” she said. “The past few weeks have been challenging for all of us.”

In the second section, a character also named David lives in 1993 Manhattan during the AIDS epidemic and cares for his ailing older partner while avoiding anything to do with his father and his family back in Hawaii. The third section centers on a woman trapped in a dystopian future, still reeling from the effects of a devastating pandemic. —T.O.
 


In 2016, Schulz’s father died, mere months after meeting her partner and eventual wife for the first time. In three sections, “Lost,” “Found,” and “And,” Schulz muses about the mundanity of grief, the rapture of true love, and the queasy coexistence of both forces at the same time. I read a galley of this book over the holidays and couldn't stop thinking about its deep insight into the fleeting beauty of existence. —T.O.
 


Disclosure: Attenberg is an acquaintance of mine who blurbed my own upcoming book, but even if she were a total stranger, I know I would have enjoyed this memoir. Attenberg, the author of the bestseller The Middlesteins and six other works of fiction, turns to nonfiction for the first time with this autobiography about her dogged commitment to writing. From growing up as an awkward adolescent in suburban Chicago to having a traumatizing experience in college to gallivanting from apartment to apartment in Seattle and Williamsburg, she writes about charting her way through adulthood unconventionally, wedded only to her art. —T.O.
 


The author of 2017’s deadpan debut Chemistry returns to bookshelves with this similarly offbeat story of an ICU doctor dealing with the aftermath of her father’s death. Joan is an extremely competent but somewhat antisocial thirtysomething working at a hospital in New York City. When her father dies of a stroke in China, she takes 48 hours off to attend the funeral and then is back to work. But a mandatory wellness break forces Joan to spend time with her mother and brother. Wang’s sense of humor makes this both a page-turner and a poignant reflection on the familial ruptures caused by immigrating. —T.O.
 


Morrison’s only published short story is reissued here with an illuminating foreword by Zadie Smith. Recitatif centers on two girls of different races, Roberta and Twyla, who are sent to a state shelter. Crucially, though, we are never told who is Black and who is white. Like much of Morrison’s work, this story is a deceptively simple and intricate indictment of the ludicrousness of racism. —T.O.

Heti’s breakthrough novel, 2010’s How Should a Person Be?, influenced countless writers and set the stage for our current autofiction boom. Her latest once again breaks the mold of what a novel can be. The plot and setting are abstract; God creates three kinds of people: bird, fish, and bear, the first of which spawns Mira, the protagonist we follow throughout the novel. But questions that have shown up in Heti’s prior work, namely around the problems of living and what it means to be an artist, are still very much at the center. —Karolina Waclawiak

Before Beyoncé tapped this Somali British poet to write the poetry for her visual album Lemonade, Shire was already a prolific writer, with two chapbooks, Teaching My Mother How to Give Birth and Her Blue Body, under her belt. Now she’s publishing her first full-length poetry collection, which focuses, like much of her work, on the trauma of forced migration, familial violence, and secrets. This is a collection that merits slow and careful reading. —T.O.
 


Inspired by Robert Mugabe’s fall from power in 2017 and George Orwell’s classic fable Animal Farm, Bulawayo satirizes the dysfunctional politics that curse so many African nations in this long-awaited sophomore effort after her 2013 Booker finalist debut, We Need New Names. —T.O.
 


In this inventive debut, a disparate group of social outcasts get by in the city of Lagos, even as the criminalization of homosexuality dampens their ability to live freely. Some characters are humans, others are spirits, others seem to shift between the two. Like the work of fellow Nigerian writers Lesley Nneka Arimah and Akwaeke Emezi (who incidentally blurbed this book), these stories eschew strict realism for magical writing in both the literal and figurative sense. —T.O.
 


Vuong’s second full-length poetry collection grapples with the aftermath of his mother’s death in poems that memorably evoke the stunning immensity of loss. —T.O.
 


Picking up where her 2010 Pulitzer-winning collection A Visit From the Goon Squad left off, Egan once again hopscotches characters, countries, and years in this book about a technological invention called Own Your Unconscious that allows people to upload their memories to the cloud. The privacy implications of such an idea prompt a swift backlash. Using the inventiveness that made A Visit From the Goon Squad such a delight, Egan delivers another formally creative novel. —T.O.
 


Mandel has always excelled at drawing connections between disparate characters who seem, at first glance, utterly unrelated to each other. Sea of Tranquility is arguably her most ambitious book yet in that regard. A teenager sets sail for the wilds of Canada, a novelist lives in a moon colony, and a detective investigates a series of crimes in the ominously named Night City. Science fiction lovers will not be disappointed. —T.O.
 


Painful cramps and mood swings have always been integral components of Caldwell’s periods. But in her 30s, the symptoms appear to worsen. When the mood swings begin to threaten her burgeoning romantic relationship, Caldwell gets a medical diagnosis that confirms she has premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Armed with this information, she talks to different people about their own painful periods while also charting her experiences with love and the pressures on women in their 30s to “settle down.” —T.O.
 


Though my relationship with Abdelmahmoud, my BuzzFeed News colleague, could perhaps best be described as “gently antagonistic,” I can’t say enough nice things about his debut book. Son of Elsewhere is described as “memoir in pieces,” and indeed it gives gorgeous if sometimes brutal flashes from Abdelmahmoud’s life. Each essay covers a wide range — stories about Blackness, immigration, fatherhood, wrestling fanfiction, war, and the glory of suburban Canadian highways— but his writing always pulls you in and makes you stay, even if it’s painful, even if it hurts. —Scaachi Koul
 


In the follow-up to Batuman’s 2017 novel The Idiot, a Pulitzer finalist, Selin, a Harvard undergraduate in a confusing situationship with a grad student named Ivan, is entering her sophomore year. She’s still naively confounded by the ways of the adult world and seeks solace in fiction, even as Ivan’s ex and the technological advances of the ’90s bear down. —T.O.
 


Perrotta brings back his iconic character Tracy Flick for his newest novel. Set in the #MeToo era, the book explores themes of redemption and forgiveness as Flick finds herself back in high school, but this time navigating power dynamics as a single mother and assistant principal vying for the newly vacated top spot. Chock-full of unforgettable characters and Perrotta’s signature wit and pathos, this is a welcome return to a world rife with complex moral dilemmas. —K.W.

This marvelous debut novel from Obaro, BuzzFeed News’ deputy culture editor, follows the decadeslong friendship of Enitan, Zainab, and Funmi as they prepare for the lavish wedding of Funmi’s daughter, Destiny. Set in Nigeria, the story begins as the friends are reunited in the present day before delving into how they first met. Against the backdrop of student protests in the 1980s, these very different women forge bonds that are tested by love affairs and tragedy. It’s an unforgettable and complex portrait of female friendship. —K.W.
 


The former BuzzFeed Books founder’s intimate debut essay collection spans Fitzgerald’s childhood in Boston, precarious adolescence in rural Massachusetts, class-defined high school years in a wealthy boarding school, and adulthood in San Francisco while tackling timely topics like masculinity and body image, class, addiction, and what we inherit from our parents. Equal parts illuminating and poignant, Fitzgerald’s essays attempt to untangle what it means to be a man in this world and in his own body. —K.W.

175,It’s almost like the show was made with the explicit purpose of convincing teenagers it sucks to be social media famous.,"


In a scene from Netflix’s new reality show Hype House, 22-year-old Thomas Petrou, the de facto leader of the eponymous TikTok content collaborative, calls a meeting to discuss the members’ lack of hustle.When they gather — there are maybe 10 or so members — he looks around the room and wonders how the group got so small.“Everyone else got too famous,” one says with a laugh.This line encapsulates the central tension of Hype House, which manages to somehow make being young, rich, and famous in Los Angeles seem horribly depressing. The members of the Hype House, who are all in their late teens and early 20s, live together in a mansion and create content for TikTok as a collective under the assumption that bringing more creators together will make their videos more dynamic and interesting. Advertisement     No one in the house, though, seems to be enjoying themselves. Throughout the show’s eight episodes, the members of the house are palpably distressed, consumed with the need to succeed while watching their peers soar to heights they know they might not achieve.Even Chase “Lil Huddy” Hudson, a founding member who has become a breakout star, is stressed. Credited with helping to start an emo revival among Gen Z, Hudson was signed by Interscope Records, and here he seems to realize he needs to leave his old friends behind to advance his music career. Hudson approaches this dilemma with the awkwardness of a first-year college student trying to dump his high school girlfriend during Thanksgiving break. It’s clear he wants to move on — he has moved out of the Hype House into his own mansion — but he’s very aware that his clout was a major factor in the group’s success. Without him, what do they have?“Chase is the person who made the Hype House what it was. Because he's not here, everything in this brand falls on me,” Petrou remarks in one scene, noting in another that Hudson could lift any member to new heights by just posting them on his page every once in a while, but doesn’t.The Hype House was started in late 2019 by Hudson and Petrou and at one point counted bonafide TikTok sensations like the D'Amelio sisters (Charli appears briefly in the series, but isn’t interviewed) and Addison Rae among its ranks. Today, though, many of the stars have moved on, leaving Petrou to lead a stable of less experienced and less famous creators. “Less famous” is all relative; everyone in the house has millions of followers on TikTok, but the remaining team does not enjoy the same recognition as its superstar alumni.“We were like a family… it was so much fun just creating content every day, and now times have changed,” Petrou laments, interspersed with nostalgic clips of old Hype House videos.This is a problem for Petrou, who is trying to keep the Hype House afloat financially. He’s having trouble motivating his posse of mostly indistinguishable white dudebros to contribute to the house’s bottom line (one scene cuts from Petrou lecturing the group about their laziness to a shot of one member throwing a potted plant at another’s sleeping form). Advertisement     While Petrou frets to the camera about working 10- to 12-hour days to fulfill the group’s brand partnership deals, which pay for everything in the house, members like Connor Yates, 23, and Michael Sanzone, 19, lounge around acting like, well, young people who have no adult supervision and very little responsibility. “I’m so bored!” Yates complains.Ironically, the interesting thing about the majority of the Hype House members, considering their popularity, is how boring they are to watch. The majority are so unmemorable that I couldn’t name most of them, and very few outside of Hudson and Petrou have a storyline over the course of eight episodes. They all blend together, a mass of white, good-looking young people lounging around the house, eating snacks in sweatpants, and occasionally doing pranks or generic dances on TikTok.Larray, a YouTuber and semi-involved Hype House member, explains in one scene why he no longer goes to the house as much. “The vibes don’t hit,” he says.Larray and fellow YouTube star Nikita Dragun (who is friends with many of the members) are by far the most watchable cast members, which is odd because Dragun’s not actually in the Hype House and neither of them found fame primarily on TikTok. They’re so peripheral to the collective that you have to wonder if production brought them in to make up for the dull Hype House crew (they are also, notably, the only POC on the show).The YouTubers could certainly carry a show by themselves. Dragun is compelling (that’s how she became so famous!), but it often feels like she’s on a totally different show. She discusses the ins and outs of running her makeup line, which she developed after failing to find products she wanted as a trans woman, and drives around Los Angeles in her fuschia sports car complaining about Trisha Paytas attacking her on Twitter. I could have watched hours more of just that. But this is Hype House — she eventually has to drag herself back there to do things with the crew. She gets the boys into makeup and heels, and though it’s not as entertaining as watching her cut loose, it’s a reprieve from the monotony of the uninspired TikTokers.
 


Larray, who is known for his YouTube comedy, is also a standout, discussing his rise to social media fame and how it has impacted his life. Larray is extremely dynamic on camera, with a unique presence. In one poignant scene, he discusses how he became estranged from his parents when he came out as gay. His own crew seems more tightly bonded than the Hype House’s, from his loving grandmother and aunt in Compton to his roommate Ravon, who used to be a fan and got Larray’s attention by posting a Carpool Karaoke–style video featuring a cutout of the YouTuber in the passenger seat.Meanwhile, the members of the house who do have storylines mostly made me sad. Vinnie Hacker, a creator who looks like he stepped out of an Abercrombie catalog, openly struggles. As Dragun describes it, Hacker is “extremely sexualized” on TikTok because of his hot bod, but he’s really just a gamer at heart who wants to go on Twitch rather than post thirst traps.The other two members who get substantial screentime are young couple Alex Warren and Kouvr Annon, both 20 and original Hype House members. Both Warren and Annon open up to the cameras about their tumultuous childhoods and the instability they experienced before finding each other and the Hype House. This history contextualizes Warren’s thrumming anxiety, which radiates off him every time he’s onscreen. He’s constantly talking about making sure he gets more views, how popular he is, and how to remain popular.This leads him to plan more and more ambitious prank videos, with middling results. In one attempt, Warren hurts his ankle and spends many subsequent scenes hobbling around. In another, sadder scene, he convinces Annon to hold a fake wedding for a video, which he is convinced will get a good amount of views. Annon is quietly crushed; she says she would marry Warren for real, but he makes it clear he’s only interested in a stunt wedding. Annon tells the cameras she's ready to have a family with Warren, even though she’s only 20. Aware of the mismatch, the rest of the house awkwardly proceeds with the fake nuptials.
 


“I think it's a little cruel to be to honest, but at the same time, like I guess anything for views,” Dragun quips. (Warren later admits the video didn’t perform the way he had hoped.)All of this highlights the central issue, which is that the Hype House is a shell of its former self. There’s a lot of pressure to perform well, and the TikTokers’ mental health seems to be affected by these expectations. Even Petrou’s Hail Mary attempt to reclaim the former magic — a big group trip to Joshua Tree, where they can all create together in a new setting — ends in disappointment. After a night of fighting and bad vibes, Petrou slumps to the ground outside. He recites the names of Hype House girls who have made it big: Charli, Dixie, Addison.“I wish that they ever talked to me,” he says.“I’m just so scared of having to go back to where I came from,” Petrou says (he also opens up in the show about having a difficult upbringing). Annon later tells Petrou the same fear drives Warren, who admits on camera to being “very depressed.”The drama unfolding in Hype House reminds me of the TikTok sound slash Taylor Swift lyric: “I think I’ve seen this film before, and I didn’t like the ending.” Content houses like the Hype House have been popular since YouTube celebrities became a thing, and they aren’t a guaranteed path to fame and fortune. Perhaps the most well known, Jake Paul’s Team 10, was also once the darling of the social media scene and it launched several stars; Petrou himself was even briefly a member.However, in the years since, the Team 10 house has been accused of being host to bullying and sexual assault, and Paul was accused of exploiting the members and taking their profits. The house was raided by the FBI in 2020 after Paul was investigated over the looting of an Arizona mall. Advertisement     But perhaps most relevant to the members of Hype House is that many Team 10 members have vanished into obscurity. Many still work in the industry, like Nick Crompton, who was able to parlay his Team 10 experience into becoming vice president of commercial innovation and artist strategy at Universal Music Group, and Alissa Violet, who works as an Instagram influencer. But their clout is mostly gone, and they have been supplanted by newer, shinier objects — mainly, well, the kids of the Hype House.At the end of the show, Petrou seems to be wrapping his mind around the fact that the Hype House may not be long for this world. “It just doesn’t work anymore; I think it’s just time to shut [the Hype House] down,” he says.
 


In the final episode, Petrou reveals many of the key members, including Annon and Warren, have moved out, although they are still in the collective. It still exists, but the dysfunction makes you think: Is the Hype House still here because of the Netflix show, and not the other way around?If I was conspiratorially minded, I would say it’s like the show was made with the explicit purpose of convincing teenagers it sucks to be social media famous. “I feel like a kid who has all the toys in the world, but no batteries to operate them,” says Petrou in the last episode, head in his hands. Every single Hype House member seems miserable, and you just want to give them a hug, a nice place to sleep, and a 24-hour social media break.Hype House is certainly an interesting insight into the machinations of content houses and the struggles that come with them, but it is not a very fun or interesting show. By the end, I was begging the Hype House to break up and end our misery — as well as theirs. ●

176,The TikTok user who correctly guessed that Kylie was hiding her second pregnancy has returned with some more thoughts — and her nails may have given her away again.,"As any true Kardashian/Jenner fan would know, Kylie Jenner is due to give birth to her second child with Travis Scott any day now, after initially keeping her pregnancy a secret for months. However, many fans have now started to theorize that Kylie has actually given birth already — and they have the receipts to prove it. The theory — which immediately went extremely viral — bolstered other pregnancy clues spotted by fans, including the fact that Kylie’s birthday had been an uncharacteristically low-key affair and her recent reunion with former ex-boyfriend Travis Scott, which was seen as a way to repair the public’s perception of their relationship ahead of the news of a second pregnancy. Kylie went on to confirm the theories less than a month later, taking to Instagram to announce her pregnancy with a video charting its most special moments so far, alongside a caption tagging Travis. Now, the same TikTok user has done even more detective work and has come up with a new theory — that Kylie has already given birth and is keeping the news under wraps from the public. While the rest of her family were seen taking a shot with the host at the end of the show, Kylie turned away from the camera and did not consume the alcohol. Although the reunion didn’t air until June, Andy shared an Instagram video from the set on the date it was filmed — April 23. Emily points out that if Kylie already knew that she was pregnant by April 23, her due date would have been in the last week of December at the latest — meaning that baby number two should probably be here by now. And there’s further evidence to suggest that Kylie may have given birth weeks ago, starting with the Kar-Jenner’s famous Christmas Eve party on Dec. 24. Kylie opted to skip the annual bash and wasn’t seen in any of the photos, despite her 3-year-old daughter Stormi attending and being filmed alongside her cousins on Instagram. Interestingly, the toddler can be seen wearing a protective face mask in one of the brief clips that Khloé Kardashian shared to her story — the only family member to do so — suggesting that her household is taking particularly strict measures against COVID-19 at the moment, perhaps due to its vulnerable new addition. The plot thickened on Dec. 26, when Kourtney Kardashian’s fiancé, Travis Barker, shared a photo to his own social media page that had a pink-rimmed Comotomo newborn bottle in shot. Followers quickly realized that the current Kardashian/Jenner children are too old to be using this bottle, and some even noted that it was the same brand that Kylie used for Stormi when she was born. Kylie and Travis also used the holiday season to make a slow but carefully coordinated return to social media following their hiatus after the Astroworld tragedy, prompting speculation that they are building up to a big announcement. Kylie made her first post since the Nov. 5 tragedy on Christmas Eve, sharing a throwback photo of mom Kris Jenner. And for New Year's, she posted a black-and-white photo of herself showing off her bare bump and reflecting on the “blessings” and “heartache” 2021 brought her. Travis also posted for the first time since Astroworld on this date, sharing a black-and-white photo of himself looking at the ground. He simply wrote: “Always” alongside a brown heart emoji — something which appeared to be significant as Kylie shared two of them in the post’s comments, and Khloé four. Travis’s choice of caption also appears to be significant, with fans suggesting that “Always” or “Infinity” could be the new baby’s name after they noticed Kim Kardashian used the infinity emoji as a caption on a family photo on Jan. 4. These posts mark the first time the pair have posted on social media since 10 people died at the Astroworld tragedy seven weeks ago. Some fans have suggested that the couple are attempting to distance the news of their new arrival from the festival by sharing these interim posts. Just yesterday, Kylie took to Instagram again with more photos of her growing bump — which she captioned with the song lyrics “I am woman.” She also showed off her pregnancy body in videos posted over New Year. But despite using her Instagram comeback to try and dispel speculation that she’s already given birth, we know from her birthday posts that she’s no stranger to saving old videos and photos to share at a later date to throw fans off the scent. And, once again, her nails may have given the game away, with her choice of New Year’s manicure uncharacteristic to say the least. Celebrity nail technician Lisa Kon posted a close-up photo of Kylie’s fresh French manicure to her page last week (above), and fans quickly picked up on the fact that Kylie’s nails are much shorter than her usual style, which can be seen below. This suggests that the beauty guru has trimmed down her nails so as not to scratch her newborn when changing diapers and other day-to-day tasks that come with being a mom. Finally, claims that Kylie has secretly given birth reached fever pitch on Sunday, when she was suspiciously covered with blankets as she, Kris Jenner, and Corey Gamble were photographed departing a private jet. Of course the decision to cover up Kylie’s body raises questions, but her decision to fly at all while heavily pregnant is also highly suspicious. Pregnant women are advised against flying after 36 weeks, which Kylie would be well over if she became pregnant in April. And, finally, fans have also been quick to point out that this wouldn’t be the first time that Kylie has kept details of her pregnancy and delivery private. Back in 2017, she not only went into hiding and kept her first pregnancy a secret for the full nine months, but didn’t even announce the arrival of Stormi until Feb. 4, 2018 — three days after giving birth."
177,"In a wild twist, Facebook demanded that its data center be designated a “project of national importance.”","


By the time the villagers knew Facebook was coming to town, it was already too late. Three weeks later their local councilors in the idyllic Dutch hamlet of Zeewolde voted 11–8 to rezone a swath of fertile farming land half the size of Central Park and hand it to Facebook to build its “hyperscale” data center — the largest in Holland.The local councilors, including those who voted in favor of the data center, engaged with the company for almost two years prior to the vote — but without knowing that “Tulip,” the mysterious entity they’d been negotiating with, was Facebook. In fact, the councilors were among the last to know, finding out only after Facebook issued a press release revealing Tulip’s true identity ahead of the vote. Advertisement  Facebook’s demand for secrecy around its data center in the Netherlands is the latest example of Big Tech’s aggressive but covert strategy to squeeze concessions from local governments. The veil of secrecy minimizes public scrutiny and backlash, often until it is too late.“It is very strange. Everything is normally very transparent — but with data centers, it is like a big black mystic box,” said Lars Ruiter, a former municipal councilor from Hollands Kroon, who told BuzzFeed News that his village found itself in a nearly identical situation in 2017 with a secret Microsoft data center project.
 


Since the Zeewolde vote, a firestorm of public criticism has compelled the Dutch national Senate to pass a parliamentary motion asking the government to halt the project pending a national policy on data centers. But such motions are usually not legally binding, and opponents of the data center are leaning on the commitment of the Netherlands’ newly formed government to present such a policy.Data centers are the cornerstone of cloud computing. They allow you to access your Google drive from any device anywhere in the world, upload photographs to your Instagram account, and stream Netflix. The business is extraordinarily profitable: Last year, Amazon’s cloud service, for example, had earned over $40 billion in revenue as of October. But data centers like the one Facebook proposed suck up enough energy to power a small town, use millions of gallons of water a day to cool their servers, and typically provide few jobs. This has raised questions about their sustainability, their impact on communities around them, and Big Tech’s insistence on building them in secret.In 2019, officials in Texas approved $10 million in tax breaks for a data center operated by a developer named Sharka LLC — later revealed to be Google. In Iowa, Microsoft has built at least three data centers while shielding its name from the public, according to the Des Moines Register. Facebook was believed to be using a shell company in Utah to push through bills favorable to data centers as far back as 2016.In the Netherlands, Facebook encountered a national and local bureaucracy eager to attract a major US tech giant but wary of the environmental costs and public resistance. So in late 2019, when Facebook first began exploring the possibility of building in Zeewolde, its identity was known only to a few senior officials in the national government. The mayor of Zeewolde found out a year into negotiations in early 2021, the King’s commissioner of the region a short time later. The people of Zeewolde were the last to know.Meanwhile, the company embarked on a bare-knuckle offensive to secure the land, despite Dutch bureaucrats noting that the project in Zeewolde violated the National Strategy on Spatial Planning and the Environment and suggesting a different site.But Facebook was adamant about its chosen location. It even asked the government to designate its data center a project of “national importance,” a Dutch national policy normally intended to expedite land acquisition and project clearances for vital infrastructure like the national electricity grid.“The designation of a data center of national importance has never been done, so this would be difficult to explain and create a precedent for the establishment of (more) other data centers,” a Dutch bureaucrat tersely noted in an internal memo obtained by De Telegraaf. “It also seems undesirable to us to state that the location in Zeewolde is of national importance.”
 


Sandra Beckerman, a member of Dutch Parliament from the Socialist Party, said the laws around projects of national importance were drafted during the 2008 financial crisis and had been misused in the past. “The idea was to speed up projects in order to create jobs,” she said, which meant “far less democratic control by either local, regional governments or the public.” Large companies, she said, had “profited hugely from this law while local communities are deprived of rights they used to have.”Facebook also pushed the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy to lean on the state-owned electricity utility to prioritize the company’s demands for its electricity substation, warning that it would consider establishing the data center in another country if its demands weren’t met. “Tulip offers us little or no time to continue working on this: they are already asking for a clear signal from EZK this or next week,” another memo said, noting that Facebook was actively lobbying the Dutch government to take urgent action. EZK is the Dutch acronym for the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy.The ministry’s bureaucrats worried that prioritizing Facebook’s demands would distort the expansion of the Dutch national grid. But they had little leverage to negotiate. “They have a preferred position because they have a lot of money and they can pay for that,” said Ben Sonneveld, a councilor who voted against the project. “They were treated differently than others who do not have the money and have to wait.”In the end, an accommodation for the substation was made, but demand to designate the project a data center of national importance was denied.
 


Rob Smeets, a former Zeewolde councilor who opposed the project, resigned from his post weeks before the crucial vote, telling the Dutch press he had done so under pressure from his own party after flagging unspecified conflicts of interest in the negotiations. He was replaced by Hank Parisius, a party colleague who voted in the favor of the project. Had Smeets stayed, Facebook’s margin of victory would have been a much narrower 10–9.Smeets told BuzzFeed News that he stood by his statement to the Dutch press but declined to elaborate on his allegations. Parisius did not respond to a request for comment.Beckerman, the MP, said years of budgetary cuts had disempowered local governments by making them far too reliant on property taxes. Facebook’s new data center could contribute up to 2 million euros a year in taxes to Zeewolde’s municipal budget, according to the mayor’s office. “Local and regional governments don't have the power to fight large companies,” she told BuzzFeed News. “They are willing to work with these tech companies because they are always in money troubles.”
 


Facebook’s data center project in Zeewolde and the company’s efforts to hide its involvement from the people who live there are particularly contentious because they touch on two emotive national issues: land and green energy, both of which are in short supply.The Netherlands is one of Europe’s more densely populated major nations, much of the acreage lies below sea level and is protected from flooding by oceanfront dykes, and also among the most reliant on fossil fuels. But the country is also the landing point for a bundle of transatlantic undersea telecommunication cables and home to one of Europe’s biggest internet exchanges, making it a compelling destination for data centers like Facebook’s.The Netherlands is also a tax haven. The Tax Justice Network ranks it fourth in the world behind the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, and Bermuda for “​​global tax abuse,” and eighth for “financial secrecy.” Which is worth noting, because when the first tranche of land for Facebook’s data center in Zeewolde was acquired, the sale was made to a shell company called Polder Networks. Company documents obtained by BuzzFeed News show Polder’s sole shareholder is a company called Liberation Management, which advertises itself as a discreet consultancy with offices in the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Polder and Liberation did not respond to requests for comment, but Facebook spokesperson Kim van Bokhoven told BuzzFeed News, “Polder Networks B.V. is the legal representative of Meta in the Netherlands that builds and manages the data center.”This combination of corporate secrecy, tax discretion, and telecom connectivity has meant Amsterdam is now home to one of Europe’s biggest concentrations of data centers — but much of the data in the Netherlands serves users around the world. Advertisement  “Two-thirds of the data center capacity in the Netherlands is used for companies and residents not in the Netherlands,” said René Buck, founder of Buck Consultants International. Last year, a Buck Consultants International study commissioned by the Dutch government suggested that large-scale data centers offer little direct economic benefit to the communities that live around them.
 


“We often spread data needs throughout our data center infrastructure — in fact, we currently serve traffic quickly and reliably around the world,” van Bokhoven told BuzzFeed News. “So there is no guarantee that user traffic in the region will be served exclusively by this facility.Data centers consume large amounts of energy, but with many big tech companies eager to burnish their green credentials, they are increasingly located near sources of renewable energy. Many data centers in the Netherlands are monopolizing scarce green energy supplies for their own use to the chagrin of local communities.In 2017, for instance, Microsoft announced its massive data center in the Netherlands was buying up 100% of the electricity produced by a giant wind farm not far from Amsterdam. Microsoft touted this as an example of its commitment to sustainability, a perspective faithfully reproduced in sections of the press. Back in the Netherlands, commentators noted that the wind farm produced enough energy to power 370,000 homes — but all the energy was being sucked up by a single American company.Beckerman told BuzzFeed News outrage was building among citizens irked to see their tax dollars funneled into renewable energy investments that largely benefited foreign companies. “People can’t pay their energy bill, and 50% of the energy bill is made up of taxes,” she said.The municipality of Zeewolde estimates Facebook’s data center would use twice the energy used by the whole town. Ben Sonneveld, a Zeewolde councilor who voted against the project, said the company had not been upfront about how this green energy would be sourced.
 


Most of Zeewolde’s energy comes from about 400 windmills on the outskirts of the town. Project opponents like Sonneveld fear that, much like Microsoft’s data center in neighboring Holland Kroons, Facebook's arrival in Zeewolde would mean more common lands lost to windmills. While the company has made no specific references to investing in wind farms in Zeewolde, the secrecy around the project thus far has meant residents fear they will only find out about any potential wind farms when it is too late.“I calculate that we need another 140 windmills,” Sonneveld said. “So where do we put them? Nobody knows.”Zeewolde Mayor Gerrit Jan Gorter, a strong proponent of the project, told BuzzFeed News that Facebook had not received any financial incentives or tax breaks to invest in Zeewolde and that a data center in the town did not violate planning guidelines. He argued that the data center will bring jobs and investment to the region. The town council is looking to build more windmills in Zeewolde, he said, but the windmill project predates and would not be directly connected to the data center project. Gorter said Facebook’s data center intends to use “100% green power” by purchasing green certificates (known as ""guarantees of origin,"" or GVO) across the European electricity network. A GVO is essentially like a carbon credit, but for renewable energy.Gorter said the secrecy around Facebook’s data center was standard operating procedure when attracting new investment to the region to ensure that the local government did not discriminate between companies.“The actual name of the company should not make a difference as they only have to decide whether a company meets the requirements for establishment in Zeewolde,” said Gorter, referring to the recently concluded council vote on the project, “and that does not depend on the name of the company.”And Facebook argued that despite the secrecy around the project, it only has the best of intentions. ""We understand and respect that any major project and change can lead to questions and concerns. It is therefore good to emphasize that we do everything we can to be a good neighbor for everyone in the area, such as the farmers and residents of the municipality of Zeewolde,” van Bokhoven told BuzzFeed News.
 


As late as 1972, the entire province of Flevoland, where Zeewolde is situated, was a shallow brackish marsh. Every acre in Zeewolde, residents said, was painstakingly claimed by damming an inlet of the North Sea — the culmination of a decadeslong process that began in 1924 and ended sometime in 1984.“It’s a very young village, it’s the youngest village in our country. The land is very fertile. So to give 166 hectares of fertile land to metal boxes is beyond our imagination,” said Susan Schaap, who said she moved here 23 years ago. “Zeewolde is a beautiful village. There’s a lot of woods, there’s a beach, there’s sun, there’s a lot of sand, there’s a lot to do for children.”Schaap is the administrator of Stichting DataTruc Zeewolde, a Facebook group of residents opposed to the data center in their village.

“It’s not like it’s a data center where they store all this data for maybe payments, hospital applications, or, you know, medical things,” Schaap said. “They have all this information stored from people, which they sell to advertisers.”For now, the public backlash against the deal has slowed the sale of the land. A spokesperson for the Netherlands’ Central Government Real Estate Agency said the land would be transferred to Facebook only if a set of mandatory sustainability requirements were met.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy is slowly walking back its public support for the data center despite doing everything in its power to help Facebook. When BuzzFeed News asked the ministry for its formal position on Facebook’s data center, its spokesperson deferred to Zeewolde’s municipality.Beckerman, the opposition MP, said the various accommodations offered to Facebook stood in stark contrast to the experiences of the ordinary Dutch citizen when interacting with their local government.“I guess people are really fed up with the government always acting in the best interest of these large companies,” Beckerman said, adding this was “another example of a government putting too much energy and time and money in these kinds of companies.” ●

178,Our family and friendship circles seem torn in two: those who are afraid and still want restrictive measures and those who are resigned to living with COVID as the new reality.,"


In the beginning, it was scary, but it was also relatively simple: Stay home. Shut down. Wear a mask. Stay 6 feet apart. Get your shot.Now, though, things feel a lot more complicated.You can get together safely with vaccinated loved ones over the holidays, but maybe you should reconsider. Omicron appears to be more infectious, but less deadly; though you should still worry about Delta, which is less infectious, but more deadly. Schools are still open — until they’re not, sometimes not even virtually. Social media is full of posts from friends either out partying or at home quarantining. Please still wear a mask in public, but not a cloth one, even though it’s still common to exercise in most gyms without one altogether. Rapid tests are useful but hard to find and maybe not so useful after all. Fully vaccinated means two shots, but also get your booster. If you have COVID but don’t have symptoms you should isolate for 10 days — no, wait, it’s five now — but then only reenter public in a mask if you can test negative, but also if you can’t find a test, that’s OK too. Advertisement  As Americans prepare to enter their third straight year of the coronavirus pandemic, clarity feels hard to come by for many.“Honestly I’m more confused now than I was all of 2020,” said Luis Luna, a 28-year-old advertising accounts manager in Austin. “So many friends and family got infected in December, and everyone had different symptoms. It’s just hard to keep up with instructions from the CDC and most government agencies.”
 


Ileana Schinder, an architect in Washington, DC, was in tears as she described the stress and concern she has for her two young children who are lurching back and forth between classroom instruction and remote learning with each new outbreak in their class. Schinder, 45, said she feels hollow and exhausted, as if she’s run a marathon in pursuit of a bus that keeps driving forward one block at a time, over and over. “I’m an architect. I should be able to design my way out of this mental labyrinth, but I can’t,” she said. “Can you?”The world looks markedly different than it did when COVID first swept and shuttered the globe. There are now multiple vaccines that are safe and effective at preventing serious illness. More than 4.6 billion people around the world have had at least one shot. We know infinitely more about the virus, including how to test for it relatively cheaply and easily. We have new lifesaving treatments. “This is not March of 2020,” President Joe Biden assured a weary public just before Christmas. “Two hundred million [Americans] are fully vaccinated. We’re prepared. We know more. We just have to stay focused.”And yet as Omicron now infects record numbers of people globally, filling up hospitals and closing businesses and classrooms, there is a lingering and strange sense of déjà vu, even if it also feels different this time.
 


“Earlier in the pandemic, I was actually really scared I could end up killing my mother. That was a very real fear,” said Allison Clough, a 50-year-old mother of two teens in the Bay Area who asked to be identified by her middle name so as not to embarrass her kids. “I don’t think that’s very likely anymore. I don’t feel scared in that way, but it’s ruining our lives again. I guess it’s kind of confusing.”As regular people struggle to make sense of this point in the pandemic, experts are also wondering how we got here — and how we haven’t done a better job of preparing for it. “We’re in a difficult time. We’re in a strange time,” said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. “We’re in a time where we’ve had two years of experience with this disease, with this virus, and it continues to evolve … But as it evolves, we’re still in many ways kind of chasing it.”
 


Arthur Caplan, medical ethics director at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, was far more blunt and sweeping in his assessment of the current state of confusion. “I would say we’re in a cacophonous, disorienting, deteriorating mess,” he said.“Many people have no idea what to do about something simple like masking,” he continued. “Huge numbers of people are frustrated by the complete failure to provide adequate amounts of test kits. Parents are furious they’re not getting consistent policies that should have been planned weeks ago about what happens to their kids. Messaging from the CDC and other government authorities has become a mishmash of confusion for many people. Most people I talk to don’t know what fully vaccinated means and no one seems to be helping them understand it. And the internet is awash with escalating misinformation and conspiracy content.“Otherwise,” Caplan joked, “things are good.”
 


It is somewhat inevitable that the pandemic and people’s decision matrix have become more complex, given both the evolving nature of affairs and the virus itself. Even before the Omicron variant emerged, requiring yet more study and analysis, people around the world were already trying to adapt their lives around COVID. Workers were returning to offices. International borders had reopened. People were dancing in nightclubs again, albeit in many places that check vaccine cards at the door. We got to celebrate Thanksgiving.Omicron then arrived at a time when each person’s perception of risk was already changing, at an inflection point in public thinking. After a summer dashed by Delta, many had already begun to imagine a world where COVID would be with us for quite some time. The new variant’s incredible infectiousness, and apparent relative mildness for vaccinated individuals, has only seemed to deepen a sense of inevitability for many people. As comic Isabel Hagen joked, “Making plans in 2022: I can’t get covid this week, but I could next week?”“It’s with us. It’s omnipresent,” said American Medical Association President Gerald Harmon. “We’re trying to adapt to that and we’re trying to avoid being overrun, not only in our day-to-day lives but in our healthcare systems.” Advertisement  “We want to have this in the rearview mirror and we can’t quite get there,” Harmon said. “It always seems to be alongside us in the passing lane, and every now and then it gets ahead of us.”The AMA was especially critical this week of the CDC’s evolving guidance on quarantine and isolation, which has seesawed on whether a negative test was necessary for asymptomatic people to reenter public life after five days. The guidance has even confused US senators. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, whose communication skills have come under intense scrutiny, had defended the decision by arguing the tests don’t definitively show whether someone is still infectious, but large sectors of the public have not been able to keep up with this nuance.With an unmistakable sense of incredulity, Harmon released a statement on Wednesday in which the AMA president appeared aghast at the CDC. “Nearly two years into this pandemic, with Omicron cases surging across the country, the American people should be able to count on [the CDC] for timely, accurate, clear guidance to protect themselves, their loved ones, and their communities,” he said. “Instead, the new recommendations on quarantine and isolation are not only confusing, but are risking further spread of the virus.”Harmon told BuzzFeed News his intention was not to assign blame and that he still has trust and confidence in the CDC, but that he felt a duty to speak out at what he saw as mixed messaging. “When I see something that’s a little bit incongruent, it makes me a little bit uncertain,” he said. Advertisement  In defending the CDC, one prominent scientist who spoke with BuzzFeed News — but asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the questions — said they believed there is a “false assumption” that experts are all-knowing all the time. “There’s this idea in the public that the knowledge is kind of static: ‘Just tell us what it is! Why are you waffling around?’” this scientist said.“But the knowledge is accruing day by day and it’s going to change day by day as the data changes. It’s not something that can be reduced to one simple sentence because there’s all these ‘if not this, then that, and if not that, then this.’ It gets very geeky.”“I don’t think the scientists and the public health experts are confused. But there is uncertainty,” they said, citing the unprecedented nature of the pandemic. “It’s a different thing, though, to not be confused and to know what’s going to happen. The scientists don’t know what’s going to happen, but they’re not confused about what does happen.”For regular Americans, though, it has been somewhat hard to keep up. “In my opinion, the CDC has been frustratingly unclear on defining a mask’s effect on determining close contacts,” said Roger Yamada, a 38-year-old attorney in New York City. “How do we assess cloth masks vs. surgical masks vs. KN95/KF94/N95 masks? Or does it not matter at all?” Advertisement  “More than anything it’s just annoying,” said Daniel Golson, a 28-year-old social media editor in Los Angeles, who with his friends is navigating the maze of testing and isolation guidelines after an outbreak among some of them on a New Year’s trip to Montana. “I want to do the right thing to prevent me from potentially infecting others, but I also don't want to unnecessarily spend money to have to stay in a place and not go home if I don't need to.”
 


Public health officials have been clear that this Omicron wave is not like previous surges. Top White House medical adviser Anthony Fauci has said it was “very prudent” for the CDC to try to change its guidance based on the emerging data on the variant’s transmissibility and period of infectiousness, in order to try to avoid massive staff shortages across every industry and effectively keep society running. Fauci also said this past weekend that the US was entering a new stage of the pandemic where hospitalizations, not total caseloads, should be the focus of public attention. Advertisement  But the prominent scientist said it was evident there was something of a fissure between experts and the public. “The American public has become over decades science illiterate,” they said. “Scientists tend to talk in a different language than regular people can understand. It’s kind of a mismatch between those who communicate and those who want to be communicated with not talking the same language.”
 


Caplan, the NYU medical ethicist, said he believed that due to this scientific illiteracy, it was natural that people have become confused, even angry, by the shifting messages. “If you have lousy training on critical thinking and scientific methods in your high schools and junior high schools then it’s no accident that citizens don’t know how to interpret what’s going on in a plague,” he said.Clough, the Bay Area mother, said her friendship circles seem torn in two by those who are afraid and still want restrictive measures and those who are resigned to trying to live in what they feel is their new reality. “Some of my friends are worried school closures are going to be a drag and others are still afraid they’re gonna die,” she said. “It’s a little hard to navigate between all that.”Tensions are also high in her community, where whether or not your children will be in class can depend on a county line. Everyone she knows is vaccinated, including her kids and their friends, but there seems to be politics everywhere. She’s noticed people again walking solo on the beach but still wearing a mask, which she thinks they’re doing as some sort of statement. She said she was accused of wanting to murder teachers when she raised a statistic about the extremely low risk of children becoming extremely ill or dying from COVID. “Just looking at the numbers, the chance that even without the booster shot my 13-year-old is going to end up seriously ill is vanishingly small,” she said, “but it’s become so politicized in my extremely liberal community that it’s almost like some people want to hold on to the possibility of that against all this data.”In DC, Schinder, the architect and mother, begrudgingly admitted she’s even begun to question her own Democratic politics when she looks with jealousy at photos of friends’ children in Republican-led states where schools have stubbornly stayed open through most of the pandemic. How is it fair, she wonders, that her city’s leaders seem to be prioritizing people’s right to go to bars over her kids being in a classroom?
 


“If you’d have told me that two years down the road my kids wouldn’t be in school, I’d have thought that we didn’t yet have a vaccine, a health solution. But we’ve moved on from that. We have a health solution,” Schinder said. “What pains me is we’re still adapting every decision to those that effectively decide to ride bicycles without a helmet, to those that ride in cars without seatbelts. I think it’s time to move on.”A group of former Biden expert advisers might agree with her. Six scientists who served on the president’s transition health advisory board on Thursday published a series of opinion pieces in the Journal of the American Medical Association calling for the administration to now focus on what they called “the new normal of life with COVID.” Omicron, they said, had “created concern about a perpetual state of emergency.”They advocated, among other things, for changes and improvements to testing, vaccine mandates and technology, and data collection. But more than anything, they said the focus needed to be on the future, not the cloud of the current crisis. “We think a lot of work still needs to be done to see through that smoke to see how this is going to end, and start laying down steps for how we will be able to live a normal life,” one of the scientists, Rick Bright, told the New York Times.Both the APHA’s Benjamin and the AMA’s Harmon said they also felt more of a focus on modeling was needed to better predict and respond to future iterations of this virus and others so as to avoid more chaos. That could include extensive new investment in public health infrastructure and preventative medicine, such as vaccines.“The nature of the virus is unpredictable, but that’s the nature of any enemy,” said Harmon, a retired Air Force major general. “Using a military analogy, we need to not fight the current war or previous wars, we need to plan for future engagements. We need to think of asymmetric warfare with this virus.”Still, Harmon said, right now an urgent challenge is to try to reach those weary soldiers on the homefront who are finding themselves, like Clough in the Bay Area, struggling to see the way forward.“Even when things seem nutty, I don’t have the energy to develop strong opinions and advocate for them like I did in the first shutdown,” Clough said. “I can’t muster the same passion for it that I had earlier. I feel tired. I feel a little bit resigned to whatever is going to happen.” ●

179,"“It’s been said that Sidney Poitier does not make movies, he makes milestones,” former president Barack Obama once said of the revered actor, who was the first Black man to win an Oscar.","


Sidney Poitier, the trailblazing Bahamian American actor whose commanding talent and immense charm helped him shatter racial barriers in Hollywood and pave the way for generations of Black talent, died Thursday. He was 94.His death was announced by Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis, who said in an address that his country was mourning the cultural icon. Advertisement  “We admire the man, not just because of his colossal achievements,” Davis said, “but also because of who he was, his strength of character, his willingness to stand up and be counted, and the way he plotted and navigated his life’s journey.”The first Black man to win an Oscar, Poitier was revered around the world for helping to advance US racial dialogue in the turbulent 1960s through his art and celebrity.At their core, his most celebrated performances — a wandering and wry ex-soldier helping a group of nuns build a chapel in Lilies of the Field; the patient yet stern teacher to an unruly London high school class in To Sir, With Love; a cerebral detective battling racism and crime in the Deep South in In the Heat of the Night — were each built off a quiet elegance and beguiling grace that were unmistakably Poitier’s own. Advertisement  A lion of American cinema, Poitier has been championed as a pioneer and personal role model by some of the country’s most celebrated Black entertainers, including Denzel Washington, James Earl Jones, and Oprah Winfrey. At a 1992 event honoring Poitier, the actor was stunned to discover civil rights icon Rosa Parks was in the audience. She, too, admitted to being a Poitier fan.“It’s been said that Sidney Poitier does not make movies, he makes milestones —milestones of artistic excellence, milestones of America’s progress,” said former president Barack Obama in honoring the actor with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 — some 42 years after Poitier’s character in Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner dreamed of his biracial children one day growing up to be president.
 


Poitier was born two months prematurely in Miami in 1927, and his parents were impoverished tomato farmers visiting from the Bahamas. At a loss, his mother took her weak baby to a fortune-teller who assured her: “Don’t worry about your son. He will not be a sickly child. He will walk with kings. He will step on pillars of gold. And he will carry your name to many places.” (Evelyn Poitier lived long enough to see her son become the first Black Best Actor winner.)Raised in the Caribbean nation until he was a teenager, on an island he once said had just two white people on it, Poitier grew up unaware of the racial politics simmering just across the sea in the US. “No one ever told me, ‘You must be careful because there are things out there that are not friendly [for Black people],’” he later said.After arriving in the US, and a brief service in the medical corps during World War II, he was rejected from New York City’s American Negro Theater because of his accent. Fueled by the sting of rejection, he fastidiously listened to radio announcers, mimicking their enunciation to shed his own until he was accepted into the same theater group just six months later. Advertisement  A career on Broadway followed, but cinema proved more difficult due to the scarcity of roles for Black actors that weren’t steeped in racial stereotypes. “It was difficult. [Black actors] were so new in Hollywood. There was almost no frame of reference for us except as stereotypical, one-dimensional characters,” he told Winfrey in 2000. “Not only was I not going to do that, but I had in mind what was expected of me — not just what other Blacks expected but what my mother and father expected. And what I expected of myself.”His early screen roles reflected his unwillingness to cater to Hollywood’s restrictive demands in favor of more challenging fare: a Black doctor caring for a bigoted white criminal in 1950’s No Way Out (so controversial it was banned in the British-ruled Bahamas and parts of the US); a clergyperson in apartheid South Africa in Cry, the Beloved Country (1951); and an inner-city high school tough brimming with untapped potential in Blackboard Jungle (1955).In 1959, he became the first Black man to be nominated for a competitive Academy Award for his role as a prison escapee in The Defiant Ones — a film he later said he was only able to do because he agreed to act in another film he found more problematic, 1960’s Porgy and Bess. Advertisement  He also starred in the 1959 milestone premiere of Lorraine Hansberry’s now-classic play A Raisin in the Sun, the first play ever written by a Black woman to show on Broadway. “Never before,” declared the writer James Baldwin, “had so much of the truth of Black people’s lives been seen onstage.”
 


But it was during the 1960s that Poitier truly came into his own, delivering a series of performances that would leave indelible marks on American cinema.He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for 1963’s Lilies of the Field, cementing his place in movie history as the first Black man to take home an Oscar. (Hattie McDaniel had won the Best Supporting Actress prize in 1940 for her role in Gone With the Wind.)Not expecting to prevail in a category that included Albert Finney, Richard Harris, Rex Harrison, and Paul Newman, Poitier had prepared no acceptance speech but took the stage to thunderous applause.“Because it is a long journey to this moment, I am naturally indebted to countless numbers of people,” a visibly emotional Poitier told the Oscars crowd in his acceptance speech.
 


His most prolific year came in 1967 with the release of To Sir, With Love; In the Heat of the Night; and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, one of the most notable films to so directly address and debate the racial politics that America was grappling with during the decade. As Poitier’s character meets the supposedly enlightened parents (Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, in his final role) of his white fiancé (Katharine Houghton), the four must confront the prejudices and fears of the era in 100 minutes of domestic discussion.“You and your whole lousy generation believes the way it was for you is the way it’s got to be. And not until your whole generation has lain down and died will the dead weight of you be off our backs!” Poitier’s character tells his father (Roy E. Glenn) in one of the film’s most memorable speeches. “You think of yourself as a colored man. I think of myself as a man.”By 1967’s end, the most famous Black man in cinema was also the industry’s top-grossing box office star of the year. Advertisement  
 


Poitier’s most iconic characters were, by and large, honorable men — endlessly patient, reliably affable, and wholly stripped of any semblance of sexuality — a conscious choice, he said, because of the pressures of history weighing upon him.Citing Quincy Jones, Winfrey later told Poitier he had “created and defined the African American in film.”“It’s been an enormous responsibility,” he acknowledged. “And I accepted it, and I lived in a way that showed how I respected that responsibility. I had to. In order for others to come behind me, there were certain things I had to do.”
 


His character choices also earned him his detractors, though, with some turning on him for supposedly playing exclusively to white America. “He thinks these films have really been helping to change the stereotypes that Black actors are subjected to,” African American playwright Clifford Mason wrote in a famous 1967 New York Times piece titled “Why Does White America Love Sidney Poitier So?” “In essence, they are merely contrivances, completely lacking in any real artistic merit. In all of these films he has been a showcase nigger, who is given a clean suit and a complete purity of motivation so that, like a mistreated puppy, he has all the sympathy on his side.”Poitier told Winfrey the “Uncle Tom” backlash was hurtful but not totally unexpected in the turbulence of the civil rights era: “It was far from the truth, but I understood the times. There was a public display of all the rage that [Black people] had built up over centuries.”“What the name-callers missed was that the films I did were designed not just for Blacks but for the mainstream,” he said. “I was in concert with maybe a half dozen filmmakers, and they were all white. And they chose to make films that would make a statement to a mainstream audience about the awful nature of racism.”The criticism led Poitier to a “crossroads” in his career, as he termed it, moving him behind the camera to the director’s chair.Apart from reprising his In the Heat of the Night role in two sequels, his career in the 1970s was most notable for the many films he directed (and in which he also occasionally starred): the 1974 comedy Uptown Saturday Night, starring Billy Cosby and Harry Belafonte; two more Cosby films, Let’s Do It Again (1975) and A Piece of the Action (1977); and 1980’s Stir Crazy, featuring Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder. (He also helmed the 1990 vehicle Ghost Dad, one of the most terrific flops in movie history.)
 


As the decades continued, Poitier delivered largely forgettable roles on television and in cinema, but his iconic status had already been cemented in the American cultural canon.It took almost 40 years for a second Black actor to win the Best Actor prize, with Denzel Washington claiming the statue in 2002 for Training Day.Poitier was in the audience that night, too, having been bestowed an Honorary Oscar for his work in the industry inscribed with the words, “To Sidney Poitier, in recognition of his remarkable accomplishments as an artist and as a human being.”As Washington took the stage, Poitier looked on, beaming.“Forty years I’ve been chasing Sidney, they finally give it to me. What do they do? They give it to him the same night,” Washington joked. “I’ll always be chasing you, Sidney. I’ll always be following in your footsteps.”

180,"Some refer to it as entering their Reputation era, and this week YouTube star Emma Chamberlain embraced it.","


This is an excerpt from Please Like Me, BuzzFeed News’ newsletter about how influencers are battling for your attention. You can sign up here.I’ve recently noticed a trend reemerge among celebrities and influencers that I can’t stop thinking about: unfollowing everyone on Instagram.Some refer to it as entering their Reputation era, a nod to Taylor Swift, who famously unfollowed everyone in 2017 and posted snakes on her feed to promote her post-cancellation album. Five years later, her following count still sits at zero. Other Gen Z celebs have also embraced the unfollow, such as Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo. Then this week, YouTuber and influencer Emma Chamberlain, who has over 14 million followers, purged her Insta account to follow no one. Advertisement     It feels like a blue checkmark is no longer enough for celebrities to prove their social media power. Instead, it’s following zero people that elevates them to god level.During an interview on Capital Breakfast, a UK radio show, Swift explained that wiping her profile clean and unfollowing people was in protest to how the media monitored her every move via social media.“I’m starting to realize that if I didn’t wish one of my friends a happy birthday on Instagram, there would literally be articles saying like, ‘Unsquadded: She’s no longer friends with so-and-so!’ And I’d literally be at the person’s birthday party with them and because I hadn’t posted,” Swift said. “I kind of reject this idea that if you didn’t see it on the Internet it didn’t happen.""For Chamberlain, it might be a way for her to spend less time online — something she has been vocal about wanting to do. She’s already deleted her Twitter and TikTok accounts. Fans noticed and called it “queen behavior.""
 


After a few days at zero, Chamberlain started following one Insta account: her own coffee brand.The unfollow move makes sense for celebrities. With constant eyes on Rodrigo’s Instagram and when she would or wouldn’t unfollow her ex-boyfriend Joshua Bassett, unfollowing everyone probably eliminated a possible headline. There’s also the perceived power it gives these celebrities. No one is good enough for Beyoncé to follow; her count has been zero since day one. Even Oprah only follows three accounts for the companies she owns or does business with. Ed Sheeran follows his brand’s account and the restaurant he opened in 2019.I reached out to Anna Russett, a YouTuber and product specialist at YouTube, who unfollowed everyone on Instagram in 2018 after realizing she was following too many people she didn’t know. Plus, as a vlogger with more than 88,000 subscribers, she knew some of her fans would follow everyone she was following, including her boss or her nonpublic friends. Advertisement     “That was strange,” Russett told me. “Some people just want a way to be closer to your life in some way when you create content, and that was a couple of people’s ways of doing that.”She still has a finsta, which she uses to follow some influencers she likes, but unfollowing everyone has given her more agency, she said. Instead of someone’s post popping up on her phone, she has to seek it out, meaning she spends less time on the app.
 


For Russett, Swift, and Rodrigo, using Instagram as a creator rather than as a consumer isn’t that wild of an idea. Social media is a way for them to sell themselves and their art. But on Facebook, where someone has to be your friend to see your posts, unfriending everyone is almost like disappearing.Stephen, who declined to disclose his last name, told BuzzFeed News that after his grandmother died in October, he began to reevaluate whom he was sharing information with online.“I started to have a frustration about sharing parts of my life with all the strangers I’ve collected throughout the course of my life but not being able to share it with a close family member who’s no longer around,” he said.Stephen, who is 24, has been on Facebook for half of his life, which makes his skin crawl. So he deleted more than 1,000 Facebook friends, leaving only his brother and boyfriend. In a way, he was reinventing himself, but he realized there was a darker side to his actions.“I was trying to erase myself, for lack of a better phrasing of it,” Stephen said. “It really felt like I was trying to kill myself off of it in a way.”Unfriending everyone gave him some anxiety, so he slowly added close friends and family members back — but now that he has fewer Facebook friends, he’s on the website less.Chamberlain seems to want the same. When she deleted her TikTok, she said on her podcast that it was a “life-changing experience.”Maybe unfollowing everyone on Instagram is a way of forcing herself to use the app less, like how many people make a New Year’s resolution to cut down on their social media intake.“It seemed like TikTok kept me entertained in bed to the point where I would stay in bed so much longer,” she said. “Within the first few days of deleting TikTok, I stopped laying in bed so much because I would get so bored. It forced me to get up, and I felt like I was doing more chores.”Until there’s a way to mass unfollow people, it’s too much of a chore for me to unfollow more than 2,000 accounts. I would rather just keep scrolling.

181,"Prosecutors say Anthony Williams joined the mob that stormed the Capitol. With federal charges pending a year later, he filed a request asking for permission to leave the country for a trip to Jamaica.","


WASHINGTON — Prosecutors say Anthony Williams of Michigan joined the mob that stormed the US Capitol. With federal charges pending a year later, Williams filed a request in court shortly after 2 p.m. on Thursday asking for permission to leave the country for a 10-day trip to Jamaica.Two hours later, the judge delivered her ruling: Absolutely not.In a one-paragraph order laced with disbelief that Williams would make such a request at all under the circumstances, US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell explained that Williams’ request not only was inappropriate given the status of his case but also that his timing was terrible. Advertisement     “This Court will not commemorate the one-year anniversary of this attack on the Capitol by granting defendant's request for non-essential foreign travel when he is awaiting judgment for his actions on that day,” Howell wrote.When and how people charged in the Jan. 6 insurrection can travel has been a fraught issue in these cases before. In February, Jenny Cudd of Texas asked for permission to go on a work-related bonding retreat to Mexico. The ask was not unheard of; it’s common for judges to allow defendants facing nonviolent offenses to travel if they’re complying with their pretrial release conditions. But Cudd’s request, the fact that the prosecutor didn’t oppose it, and the judge’s approval made her a lightning rod for criticism that the Justice Department and judges were treating alleged Capitol rioters with kid gloves.When Florida couple Dana Winn and Rachael Pert asked to appear by video for their December sentencing instead of traveling from their home state to Washington, DC, US District Judge Trevor McFadden rejected the request.“Defendants found the means to travel to Washington, D.C. to commit the crime to which they have pled guilty,” McFadden wrote at the time. “Defendants can therefore find the means to return to Washington, D.C. to be held accountable for this crime.”
 


Williams is facing a five-count indictment, including one felony charge for obstructing an official proceeding. According to his charging papers, the FBI received a tip that he had posted on Facebook about being at the Capitol on Jan. 6. After getting access to the account through a search warrant, the government alleged that it found videos and photos that showed him inside. In one video, the person identified as Williams talks about storming the building and pushing back against police officers. “We took this fucking building,” he says in the video. The FBI also pulled messages that he had allegedly posted, including, “Was proudest day of my life lol felt like the founding fathers were smiling down on us in that room.”Those words partly doomed Williams’ effort to get to Jamaica. He had been allowed to go home after he was charged and arrested in March. In his travel request, his lawyer wrote that he had been in a romantic relationship for “more than a year” and was hoping to meet his girlfriend’s family, who live in Negril, located in the western part of the country. He would leave in late January, stay for 10 days, and work at a local nonprofit during the visit.The pretrial services officer, who supervises Williams’ compliance with his pretrial release conditions, didn’t oppose the trip, but the prosecutor did.Howell began her order by recapping the request: “Defendant, while on pretrial release and facing charges including a serious felony offense, stemming from his alleged actions on January 6, 2021, wishes to leave the Michigan winter to spend ten days in the warmer climes of Jamaica to meet the family of a woman with whom defendant has been in a committed relationship for ‘more than a year.’”She continued: “Although such a meeting may be an important step in defendant's personal relationship, defendant surrendered his entitlement to unfettered international travel when, also ‘more than a year’ ago, on December 30, 2020, he allegedly announced his intent to ‘Storm the Swamp,’ and one week later, on January 6, 2021, followed through by joining a mob at the Capitol that, in his words, ‘took [that] fucking building,’ an event he allegedly viewed as the ‘proudest day of [his] life.’”The judge concluded with the denial, invoking the one-year anniversary of the Capitol attack.Williams is due to appear before Howell again on Jan. 21 for a hearing on the status of his case. His lawyer declined to comment.

182,A stockpile of as many as 1 million COVID-19 tests sat unused in a Florida warehouse and have expired as the state — and the rest of the country — are facing a steep demand for tests and a surge of new infections.,"


A stockpile of as many as 1 million COVID-19 tests sat in a Florida warehouse and expired, Gov. Ron DeSantis admitted on Jan. 6 as the state and the rest of the country are facing a steep demand for tests and a surge of new infections.But rather than let the tests go unused, the Food and Drug Administration has allowed the state to extend the expiration date of the tests, allowing them to be used until March as the state, and the rest of the country, faces a surge of new COVID cases due to the Omicron variant. Advertisement     The governor's office had previously brushed off questions about the stockpile's expiration, but when asked during a press conference, the state's Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie admitted that somewhere between 800,000 and 1 million tests had expired at the end of the year.""We tried to get them out,"" Guthrie told reporters. ""But there was not a demand for it.""Yet last week, Floridians reportedly waited up to three hours to get a COVID-19 test as cases and potential exposures spiked due to the more infectious Omicron variant. And on Dec. 21, officials in the state's most populous county, Miami-Dade, reportedly asked state officials to send any available tests to meet the spiking demand.""We are asking that all possible tests that come through the state for distribution be allocated to Miami-Dade given the surge in demand in our community for testing options,"" a spokesperson for the county mayor's office told Local 10. Advertisement     In a letter obtained by BuzzFeed News, the FDA extended the expiration of the tests to 15 months due to Florida's ""ongoing stability studies."" The extension marks the second time Florida has requested an expiration date extension for that particular batch of tests.The tests, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Health said, were not at-home tests and must be administered by professionals.
 


DeSantis on Jan. 6 said tests were being sent out to local jurisdictions as requested. Demand for COVID tests had slowed down in September, when the tests in the stockpile were first set to expire, he added.""There was no withholding of anything,"" the governor told reporters.State officials at that time requested permission from federal health officials to extend the use of the tests for three more months, Guthrie said. That request was granted, but still the tests sat unused and expired between Dec. 26 and Dec. 30.Florida officials then requested another three-month extension to use the tests.""The thing is, if they're not authorized, if they're not accurate, we don't want to send inaccurate tests,"" DeSantis said.The existence of the unused tests became public when Florida agriculture commissioner Nikki Fried put out a statement about them, pointing out they were about to expire.""Given the Governor's lack of transparency throughout this pandemic, there's no known public information about these tests or how soon they expire,"" she said on Dec. 30 in a statement. ""With omicron infections exploding throughout Florida, I beg of him to release these tests immediately to local counties and cities, and to stand up state-sponsored testing sites. To let these tests expire while Floridians anxiously wait for hours in testing lines is negligent at best, and heartless at worst.""Fried, a Democrat, is currently running for governor.DeSantis's office at first brushed off questions about the tests, with his spokesperson Christina Pushaw telling a local NBC 2 reporter that Fried's allegation was ""bizarre.""After DeSantis admitted the tests had expired, Pushaw then inaccurately tweeted that the tests had expired before the Omicron surge, leaving out that an extension of their use had been authorized.Fried, in turn, accused DeSantis and his office of lying and now attempting a cover-up.""The governor of the third largest state lied to you about COVID tests,"" she tweeted. ""When we caught him, he used your tax dollars to come after me for telling you the truth.""

183,The claim is the latest complication in a high-profile case that once seemed like a slam dunk.,"


Federal prosecutors say a key FBI informant in the alleged plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan was a “double agent” who was “working against the interests of the government” by trying to destroy evidence and prevent arrests.The confidential informant, Stephen Robeson, played a central role in the investigation that led to the arrest of 14 men for allegedly participating in a plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in October 2020. At the direction of his FBI handlers, Robeson reached out to potential targets, organized meetings, and paid travel expenses for people to attend such events. Advertisement     Now the government appears to be disowning its own operative, saying he deceived the FBI and at times actively aided targets of the investigation.Defendants have claimed that it was overzealous government informants, including Robeson, who hatched the alleged plot to kidnap a sitting governor. The defendants have denounced the case as entrapment and an example of “egregious overreaching,” claiming they never would have contemplated the purported crimes without the informants’ involvement.In a court filing Thursday, prosecutors said that Robeson violated the terms of his agreement with the FBI, including by possessing firearms despite having felony convictions, offering the use of “charity funds to purchase weapons for attacks,” and offering a drone to “aid in acts of domestic terrorism.”In addition, the filing said that Robeson failed to record “pertinent conversations and events,” didn’t tell his government handlers about other recordings he’d made, tried to delete recordings, and attempted to warn “at least one of the defendants shortly before their arrest” in October 2020. Advertisement     Last month, Robeson was charged with fraud in state court in Wisconsin. He was also charged last March with a gun crime in federal court to which he ultimately pleaded guilty, under a highly favorable plea deal that involves no jail time despite his multiple prior convictions. Despite that, the Justice Department has remained largely silent on his activities in the Michigan investigation, not even confirming his role as an informant — until now.The prosecutors’ statements may have significant implications. Defense attorneys have been trying to get Robeson’s communications admitted as evidence, because they want to show that instead of just observing and informing on the accused, he pushed them into a plot they would never otherwise have come up with or agreed to. To that end, the lawyers last month identified dozens of statements by Robeson they hope to bring up during the trial, which is scheduled to begin March 8 in Grand Rapids federal court.The government’s response, laid out in the new filing, has been to disavow Robeson entirely. In the filing, they call him “an unreliable declarant” — legal speak for a liar — and say that his statements cannot be used as evidence.Robeson’s attorney did not respond to a request for comment. Attorneys for several of the defendants also declined to comment.Defendants have also sought to introduce communications between FBI agents and their informants, saying they help prove that the government planted specific ideas about violence in their heads.For example, in August 2020, agent Jayson Chambers wrote to an informant known as Dan: “Mission is to kill the governor specifically.”But in Thursday’s filing, prosecutors said that any statements made by the agents that the government has not specifically cited in search warrants, charging documents, or other formal court filings should not be admitted in court. Although they were working for the FBI on an active investigation at the time they uttered those words, prosecutors say they were “the agents’ own statements and not the statements of the United States government.”The Justice Department has previously stated its intentions to keep those agents off the stand.Chambers was removed from the witness list five days after BuzzFeed News reported that he had incorporated a security business and that an online troll linked to the business had been tweeting about the case before it became public. Another agent has been accused of perjury in a separate case. Advertisement     Defense attorneys, however, are expected to try to call both of them, as well as Robeson, and to question them before the jury about their actions in the investigation.Jessica Garrison contributed to this report.

185,"“We, as teachers, have to sacrifice the health of our own children to accommodate other people’s children,” one teacher who is a parent of two 4-year-old children told BuzzFeed News.","


As millions of COVID cases spread across the US, teachers and parents have been thrown into chaos as some school districts revert to remote learning, leading to rising tensions as families try to limit exposing loved ones to the virus.Without universal childcare in the US, many parents rely on schools and are exhausted by the prospect of balancing at-home learning responsibilities on top of careers or other caregiving. Teachers, meanwhile, fear they can’t provide effective instruction with so many students either at home with illness or kept from schools by their parents. Advertisement     And then there’s the disarray for teachers who are also parents, a group that is struggling to protect the health of their students and that of their own children. BuzzFeed News spoke to multiple teachers who are parents, many of whom have made the difficult choice to keep children home given how much the coronavirus is spreading in schools — a frustrating move for educators who believe that in-person learning is always better.Some are taking lessons home for their kids or making them up independently while also leading their classes and volunteering free time to support unions. They’re more burned out than ever and afraid they’ll be the ones to bring home the virus.“It feels unfair,” said Andrea Keller, a teacher at PS 96 in the Bronx and a parent of 4-year-old twins. “We, as teachers, have to sacrifice the health of our own children to accommodate other people’s children.”Keller used one of her sick days Wednesday to stay home with one of her children who has croup, a side effect of COVID that’s essentially an infection of the upper airway, but she said her classroom was practically empty that day anyway. In addition to her own family, Keller said nearly half her students tested positive for COVID over the holiday break. Advertisement     Her school’s attendance has been lagging since classes resumed Jan. 3, Keller said, and for people like her who are teachers and parents, they face additional complexity as the new year begins — teachers don’t want to go to work at the expense of their family’s safety.“I’m just biding time until I can get a good lesson or a good amount of kids,” Keller said. “The school has to open so other people can have free childcare, but now my kid is sick because I went to school and I brought home the virus. And now I have to stay home and lose a sick day so that you can send your kid to school for babysitting because they’re not getting an education right now.”For teachers who are parents like Keller, she said it feels like the decision is made without any concern for what teaching in person would risk for her own children, who are too young to be vaccinated against COVID.“It starts the domino effect of now, you insist that your kids have in-person schooling, so now I have to show up to teach your kids, but that doesn't address my own children and their needs,” Keller said.School districts in cities including Pittsburgh, Detroit, St. Louis, Atlanta, Milwaukee, and Cleveland have opted for temporary virtual learning, citing health and safety concerns.Parents across the country responded with outrage and a sense of hopelessness at the prospect of once again balancing full-time work or childcare with homeschooling — and their reactions reflect a situation in which there are few good options. But the worst option, experts say, is to further hollow the divide between parents and teachers.“I don’t think we want to set up or exacerbate potential conflict between parents and teachers, when so many parents are teachers as well,” said Dan Ehlke, associate professor of health policy at SUNY Downstate School of Public Health.The pandemic has stressed the issue of inaccessible childcare in the US, Ehlke added. A side effect of this is tension between teachers unions and parents. In Chicago, students missed a second day of school Thursday after the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and school administrators failed to reach an agreement. Some Chicago Public School parents responded to the union’s vote to switch to remote with frustration, saying they were not prepared and couldn’t afford to miss work. Advertisement     “I don’t think it’s easy for anyone involved in this,” said Lori Koziana, a teacher at Mather High School in Chicago who told BuzzFeed News she was home sick with COVID. “I just want us to find a middle.”
 


Koziana said she isolated for a week and tested negative before returning to classes on Monday, when 32 of her students were absent (CPS ceased testing students before they came into buildings).“I go to great lengths to make sure I’m healthy,” Koziana said, adding that she distances from her own students and only walks in the school’s hallways during specific low-traffic periods of the day.But by Wednesday she had the virus.“It’s very difficult at the high school level to social distance in any meaningful way when you have thousands of kids in hallways moving from one class to the next,” she said, adding that she supports the union’s vote for a temporary switch to remote learning to allow local healthcare systems to catch up with demand.Her sons, one a high school sophomore, the other a senior, are isolating at their father’s house, she said, but one of them is developmentally delayed and the other is severely immunocompromised. Remote learning isn’t an option for CPS students, so she has to send them back to school as soon as their isolation ends or they won’t keep up.“A lot of these considerations are getting intertwined with labor relations,” Ehlke told BuzzFeed News, adding that it's “atrocious” some districts justify labor-related decisions like salary cuts or benefits changes for teachers who opt to work from home for reasons involving the pandemic.Ehlke and his wife are teachers and parents of three children, and he said it's easy to have conflict within families like his when educators must prioritize other kids’ health over that of their own. Not to mention the distraction and burnout caused by exhausting disagreement over COVID responses, he said, which has set up districts for major teacher shortages across the country, even before Omicron hit.Because the American school system is so localized, the experience for parents who are teachers varies from place to place, he said. With each town making its own COVID protocol, it's difficult for teachers who are parents to find a situation that works for their careers and families. For example, a teacher may work in one district and send their child to school in another — but what happens when their own child goes remote and they have to go to work in person? Or when they bring COVID home to their unvaccinated children?
 


“That’s where you see particular conflict,” Ehlke said.One solution, Keller said, would be to implement more restrictive in-person measures. For example, her classroom roster has nearly doubled compared to last year, the school has stopped staggering when kids eat, and students aren’t tested as they enter the building.“It would be helpful if we could just admit that right now this variant is super contagious and is spreading in schools,” Keller said. “Nobody wants to talk about that.”A one-size-fits-all policy won’t work, Ehlke said, but he hopes multiple districts could coordinate on a regional or county basis to make decisions and avoid “unnecessary chaos.”“I think this is an artificial divide,” Ehlke said of the tension between teachers and parents. “I think we need to make it clear that we are all in this together.”“It’s not an us versus them thing,” said Takiah Ogunlusi, an eighth-grade teacher in Griffin, Georgia. “That’s a big part of the conversation that’s missing: People don’t realize we [teachers] have children too.”Ogunlusi added it’s because she agrees with other parents that she chose to send her 11-year-old to in-person classes, but she has anxiety her oldest child will infect her other kids who are too young to be vaccinated.“The reality of the situation is that kids have contracted the virus over break,” Ogunlusi said. “At the very least, there should be a true remote option.”
 


Andrea Castellano, a parent who teaches in Brooklyn, also decided to keep her fifth-grader and eighth-grader home in Queens after the holidays. More than half of her third-grade class has been absent since classes resumed Jan. 3, and she’s just trying to get students to meet basic mental and physical wellness so they can focus on their academic achievement.Pitting teachers against parents is a conversation only some communities can afford, she said, because families of color have been disproportionately affected by COVID. Demanding that schools stay open ignores the potential effects on teachers and parents of color, too.“Those are the people that have also kept their children in remote as long as possible, and who are reluctant to send them back right now,” she said.Her children’s father has COVID right now and is isolated, so Castellano is gripped by concern that if they get sick, it will be because she brought the virus home from work.“The guilt I [would] have,” she said. “I stood outside my door yesterday. And I was like, ‘I don't want to go inside because I'm scared to give it to them.’”

186,"In Biden’s clearest and most prolonged denunciation of Trump from the executive office, he was clear about the ongoing threats to democracy related to his predecessor's brand of politics.","


On the anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection, President Joe Biden gave a speech condemning former president Donald Trump for his role in inciting violence and undermining democracy, a striking departure for the president who has spent his first year in office avoiding dwelling on his predecessor.Biden’s speech, delivered on Capitol Hill, carefully avoided naming the former president but focused on keeping the record straight on the violent pro-Trump insurrection and the threat to American democracy that Republicans have stoked in past years. Yet it was clear who he was talking about. He repeatedly brought up the “former president” and the lies he told before, during, and since the 2020 presidential election to try to undermine the results. It was Biden’s clearest and most prolonged denunciation of Trump from the executive office. Advertisement     “His bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution. He cannot accept that he lost,” Biden said. “For the first time in our history, a president not just lost an election, he tried to prevent a peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob reached the Capitol.”His decision to focus on the former president comes as Democrats weigh whether anti-Trump messaging could sink them in the midterms and as they try to outline what their party stands for instead of only what they stand against. Ultimately, Biden’s (accurate) portrayal of Trump was an apparent shift to address the ongoing threats to democracy, including restrictive voting laws that ultimately undermine elections across the board.Biden’s tiptoe around actually naming Trump was obvious. The president himself addressed the decision. “I did not want to turn it into a contemporary political battle between me and the president,"" he told reporters on Capitol Hill when asked why he didn't say Trump's name. ""It's way beyond that.”In a statement marking the one-year anniversary of the attack, Trump called Biden’s speech “political theater” and a “distraction.”""It looks like he saw the speech. I guess that's good news. Maybe he learned something about what it looks like to meet the moment in the country,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in response to Trump’s statement during the press briefing Thursday. Advertisement     Psaki did not immediately respond to an inquiry by BuzzFeed News about some of the thinking around the speech, including whether Biden might talk about Trump more as the midterms approach.""Biden's right. This is a crisis in democracy,” said Karthik Ganapathy, a progressive consultant with Left Flank Strategies. “Coming up with an actual plan to solve it, which we don't have a ton of time left before the midterm elections, I think that's like a really crucial thing that a lot of people, especially progressives, feel a lot of urgency about."" He added that Biden’s most direct attempt to hold Trump accountable came as “a welcome development.”Perhaps no instance best encapsulates how striking it is for Biden to focus a speech so heavily on Trump than a comment he made last month — “I don’t think about the former president” — when asked about the report that Trump tested positive for COVID before a September 2020 debate.Biden has previously addressed Trump on certain matters. In December, he pointed out that Trump had taken a COVID-19 booster shot — ""one of the few things he and I agree on"" — before going on to condemn ""companies and personalities"" peddling lies about the pandemic. He obviously also struck a direct contrast on the campaign trail not only in his own election but in other contests since.""You can't tell the story of Jan. 6 without talking about the former president,” said Addisu Demise, an Oakland-based Democratic strategist. “[Trump] invited people to Washington, incited them to violence, I would say, and in my mind it would be a denial of history to erase him from the day.”Demise said he doesn't expect Biden's focus on Trump to carry into the coming weeks and months as Democrats prepare for the midterms and the next presidential election, because it would distract from talking about his own agenda and achievements. But rather, he said, it would have been ""malpractice"" not to talk about Trump's role in the attempted insurrection on its anniversary.Looking at the bigger picture, though, Demise said it wouldn't make sense for Biden to rag on Trump, who, despite his ongoing political pull, should not be the focus of this presidency.""He was elected in large part to turn the page on the Trump era. And if he continues to focus on that, it takes him away from his job, which is to focus not on yesterday, but on tomorrow,"" Demise said. Advertisement     Democrats have spent a lot of time working to keep the record straight on the events of Jan. 6 against efforts by Republicans to rewrite history, and Biden’s speech was true to that. From the start, Democrats built a detailed case illustrating Trump’s role in inciting the violence, including during the impeachment trial last year — which he was acquitted of by Republicans. Their efforts continue today: One of the commemorative events Democrats are hosting on the anniversary of the insurrection is a moderated discussion featuring the Democratic leaders of each chamber of Congress and renowned historians.""I think using this anniversary to stand up for our country, our ideals, and what we believe in as a nation is critical,” said Scott Mulhauser, a Democratic strategist and former Biden adviser. “The scars of that day still haven't healed for so many, and part of the way we recover as a country is to ensure that our democracy stands.""

187,"Democrats, at least for a minute, are very happy to shake Dick Cheney's hand.","


WASHINGTON — Democrats lined up to greet former vice president Dick Cheney in the House chamber Thursday, a rare moment of outreach to a onetime party villain who is now one of the few high-profile Republicans to fully acknowledge what happened before and during last year's fatal Capitol riots.His daughter Rep. Liz Cheney is under attack by her own party as she continues to speak out against former president Donald Trump’s false claims of election fraud.House Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro was one of several Democrats to pay their respect to the former vice president during a short procedural session in Congress marking the anniversary of the Capitol attack.“I believe he cares deeply about this country,” DeLauro told BuzzFeed News. “We have different views on issues. I think that's important that he's here. I think it speaks to the strength of the institution and the strength of our democracy.” ​ Advertisement     “This isn't about partisanship,” she said. “This is about, you know, what this citadel of democracy represents, for him, for me, for Liz Cheney, for all of us here.”Reps. Lizzie Fletcher, David Cicilline, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and Eric Swalwell also spoke to Dick Cheney.“In this fight, he’s an ally,” Swalwell said later. “And this fight, for the soul of America, is the only one that matters.”The former vice president, member of Congress, cabinet secretary, and White House official has not exactly been beloved by Democrats over the last half-century. Throughout the presidency of George W. Bush, Cheney was portrayed by Democrats in and out of Congress as the dark force driving the president and the functional Republican power center, from the Iraq War to any number of domestic political fights. But Cheney, and his now out-of-style brand of neoconservatism, is not aligned with where the party is today.The current Republican Party leadership, he told reporters Thursday, is “not a leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for 10 years.”The House of Representatives did not have scheduled votes Thursday, and many members have stayed out of DC this week. Some House Democrats served food to US Capitol Police officers and campus staff to thank them for their actions one year ago. But Republicans in particular were not eager to be at the Capitol for the first anniversary of the insurrection, where they inevitably would have had to face renewed questions about the actions party leaders took and conspiracies Trump hawked that inspired hundreds to riot.Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz are scheduled to hold a public response to the anniversary, after Trump canceled a press conference with the same agenda. Like other House Republicans, Greene and Gaetz skipped the ceremonial events Democrats held. They instead appeared on Steve Bannon’s War Room.“We’re ashamed of nothing. We’re proud of the work we did on Jan. 6 and we’re actually going to walk the grounds that patriotic Americans walked from the White House to the Capitol,” Gaetz said on the program. The two promised to make the same “legitimate arguments about election integrity” at Thursday’s press conference. Advertisement     Cheney was not the only Democratic villain of the early 2000s to make an unusual reappearance for the insurrection anniversary. Karl Rove, for years Bush’s top political adviser, wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed condemning the riot “apologists” in the Republican Party for not being honest about what happened on Jan. 6. “If Democrats had done what some Trump supporters did on that violent Jan. 6, Republicans would have criticized them mercilessly and been right to do so,” he wrote.Republicans, instead, have been most merciless with Liz Cheney, one of two Republicans on the committee investigating the insurrection and a prime political target of Trump’s in this year’s elections. Cheney was removed from a Republican leadership position last year after voting for Trump’s impeachment.“My daughter can take care of herself,” the former vice president told reporters.

188,"The Bronx Documentary Center’s exhibit on Jan. 6 looks not only at one day, but the years that led up to it.","


Like most people on Jan. 6, 2021, I was glued to my screen. I watched as the news of the riots at the Capitol played out on Twitter, on TV, in my group chats, and in my work Slack. The last year has been about understanding how the destructive event happened, why, and what happens next.Cynthia Rivera has been the exhibitions manager at the Bronx Documentary Center for eight and a half years. Throughout Donald Trump’s presidency, she worked with photographers around the country on exhibitions related to issues that were central to the narrative in those four years — immigration, the climate crisis, and the “end of truth.” For Rivera, everything seemed connected: “We asked ourselves the question, is this a one-time event or is this a segue into something much bigger, much more chaotic, and the truth of what our democracy has become?” Advertisement  On Jan. 6, as a mob attacked the Capitol and assaulted police officers, some photojournalists who had planned on covering Trump’s morning rally realized they were in for much more. Many photographers were there for the Capitol riot. No one knew exactly what was going to happen or that people were going to storm the building, but they had gotten word that something might go down that day. ""The BDC spent a lot of time analyzing Trump's presidency, leading up to and during,” Rivera said. “It was a moment in history that seemed unreal, but we could also understand why this was happening and what led up to this moment.”Christopher Lee was in Washington that day photographing for Time magazine. ""There were a lot of photojournalists who were following the groundswell of conspiracy and anger. For me, it wasn't surprising, but it was shocking,"" he said. ""For a person who has a lot of experience covering traumatic events abroad and the violence that people can inflict on each other, I had the privilege of stepping away from that when it got too dangerous or difficult. As a native Texan and someone who lives and works in Texas, that quiet chaos and that anxiety really followed me back home [after Jan. 6]."" According to the Department of Justice, Texas constituted the second-highest number of people who were charged that day.“It wasn't until a year after the insurrection, of information unraveling, that we were able to have a full view of what happened that day,” Rivera said.We look at the exhibit, which opens in the Bronx later this month, one year after the riots.

WASHINGTON — Federal charges for the Jan. 6 insurrection began pouring in the day after the attack and haven’t stopped. The case count passed 700 just before the end of 2021. BuzzFeed News has tracked every case filed. One year in, here’s where the prosecution effort stands.The basics
 


The sprawling prosecution effort has been unprecedented in its scope. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday presented the latest statistics trying to convey the massive scale: More than 5,000 subpoenas and search warrants. Nearly 2,000 seized phones and other devices. More than 300,000 tips from the public. More than 20,000 hours of video footage. The government has routinely asked for extensions to the normal deadlines that apply to criminal cases, citing the scale of the prosecution effort and delays in developing a system to manage the massive amount of evidence.Judges and defense lawyers have at times pushed back, particularly in cases where alleged rioters were held in jail after their arrest. But for the most part, judges have allowed longer time frames. Some of the earliest cases are only just starting to wrap up. Mark Leffingwell of Seattle was the first person to face federal charges; he was arrested at the Capitol after punching two police officers. He entered a guilty plea in late October and is due to be sentenced on Feb. 10.New cases are still being filed, some rooted in tips sent to the FBI right after the attack. Take defendant Michael Oliveras of New Jersey. On Jan. 8, 2021, an anonymous tip came in about a Parler user who’d posted about being at the Capitol during the riot. The FBI matched the Parler account to a phone number linked to Oliveras. Citing that and other evidence, a prosecutor filed a criminal complaint against him on Dec. 8 — 11 months after the first tip.

Justice Department officials said in the days that followed the insurrection that they were prepared to prosecute anyone who committed a crime on Jan. 6. In a speech marking the first anniversary this week, Garland said the DOJ was still “committed to holding all Jan. 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law” — “there is no higher priority,” he said. The fact that most people who stormed the Capitol were allowed to leave and scatter across the country complicated that effort, but Garland said there was no deadline or case count milestone when they’d wind down.The government’s position is that between 2,000 and 2,500 people went inside the Capitol. That number doesn’t include people who assaulted police officers or members of the media outside. Prosecutors haven’t shown much appetite so far for charging people who crossed police barriers onto the restricted Capitol grounds but didn’t go inside or commit other crimes, although they have set precedent for that; Infowars host Owen Shroyer is being charged for being in a restricted area outdoors. On Jan. 6, Shroyer was with Infowars founder and right-wing activist Alex Jones, who hasn’t been charged. Advertisement  
 


The first plea deal became public in April, when heavy metal musician Jon Schaffer of Indiana pleaded guilty to two felonies for obstructing an official proceeding and going into the Capitol with a weapon (a can of bear spray). Schaffer had been a member of the Oath Keepers, a right-wing group that’s featured prominently in the government’s exploration of ties between extremist organizations and the insurrection. He agreed to cooperate and hasn’t been sentenced yet.The pace of guilty pleas has picked up since the summer. Prosecutors focused early plea deal offers on defendants they’d charged solely with misdemeanor crimes from the start; 150 of the 174 guilty pleas have been for those less serious categories of crimes, such as illegally being in the Capitol and parading. In 11 cases, prosecutors have agreed to let a defendant charged with a felony plead down to a misdemeanor. Advertisement  The US attorney’s office has also locked down guilty pleas from defendants in several high-profile cases involving more serious crimes: Jacob Chansley of Arizona, previously referred to as the “QAnon shaman,” who was photographed posing shirtless and wearing horns on the Senate floor, was sentenced to 41 months in prison after pleading guilty to obstruction. Four other members of the Oath Keepers are cooperating after pleading guilty to conspiracy. Former Olympic athlete Klete Keller is potentially facing two years in prison.
 


Two defendants opted to plead guilty to the full slate of crimes they were charged with instead of making a deal with prosecutors. Pleading guilty often comes with the benefit of having charges dropped, but defendants give up certain rights and may decide they don’t want to work with the government. Antionne Brodnax, a Virginia-based rapper known as Bugzie the Don, pleaded guilty to a set of misdemeanors for illegally going into the Capitol. He told the FBI he was filming a music video and used a photo of himself sitting on a SWAT vehicle in front of the Capitol as the cover of an album titled The Capital. Matthew Perna of Pennsylvania pleaded guilty to a felony for obstructing Congress as well as misdemeanor counts; in a video filmed on Jan. 6, he said: ""lt's not over, trust me. The purpose of today was to expose Pence as a traitor."" Their respective lawyers did not return requests for comment. Advertisement  
 


Probation. Incarceration. Home detention. Financial penalties. Community service. Social media limits. The sentences handed down so far have largely reflected the nature of the crimes featured in the first wave of plea deals — minimal to no jail time for low-level misdemeanor offenses. Even in misdemeanor cases, there’s a lack of consensus among judges about what just punishment looks like for joining an insurrection. The small number of rioters who pleaded guilty to more serious crimes, like assaulting police and obstructing Congress, stared down far more time behind bars — setting the stage for higher-stakes sentencing hearings this year as more felony cases slowly start to resolve. Advertisement  
 


The first sentence to cross the five-year mark went to Robert Palmer of Florida, who pleaded guilty to repeatedly attacking police outside the Capitol using a fire extinguisher and a wooden plank. His plea agreement estimated less prison time on the table if he got credit for accepting responsibility. But at his Dec. 17 sentencing, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan agreed with prosecutors that he’d blown up that opportunity by posting a fundraising pitch online after entering his guilty plea that suggested that he’d acted in self-defense; that narrative was false, Palmer admitted to the judge.
 


Once incarceration is off the table, what makes for a harsher or lighter sentence can be up for debate. Probation means resuming normal life with some conditions and restrictions. Danielle Doyle, whose former coworker at the Oklahoma City Thunder reported her to the FBI, pleaded guilty to the parading misdemeanor and received the shortest period of probation to date — two months. Most probation terms have ranged from one to three years. US District Judge Trevor McFadden also ordered Doyle to pay a $3,000 fine, a penalty that the government hadn’t asked for. Several judges have added financial consequences in the mix, with some saying they thought it might be more effective than a short stint in jail to make rioters feel some “hurt,” in the words of one judge.
 


As part of nearly every plea deal entered to date, defendants are agreeing to pay restitution to the feds — $500 for a misdemeanor plea, and between $1,000 and $2,000 for a felony plea. Any fine levied by a judge as part of a sentence is on top of that.
 


The government’s cooperators include the four members of the Oath Keepers conspiracy case and Schaffer, Matthew Greene of New York, charged in one of the Proud Boys conspiracy cases, Gina Bisignano, a Beverly Hills salon owner who recorded video of her experience entering the Capitol, Keller, the former Olympian, and Josiah Colt of Idaho, who traveled to DC with several codefendants whose cases are pending. Another 101 defendants who took plea deals also agreed to a type of partial cooperation: submitting for a final interview or giving investigators a last look at their social media posts and any photos or videos on their phones. Advertisement  
 


Adam Johnson of Florida was captured in a viral photo smiling and waving as he carried a lectern with the speaker of the House’s seal through the rotunda. But his guilty plea was notable for other reasons. Prosecutors learned that Johnson had expressed plans to write a book about his experience at the Capitol — in the government’s words, to “potentially profit off his illegal conduct on January 6, 2021.” He became the first defendant who had to agree to a provision in his deal that he would give the feds any money he earned from content he produced related to Jan. 6 for five years.
 


Chansley is one of three defendants pursuing appeals of their sentences after pleading guilty. The others are Scott Fairlamb, a New Jersey man sentenced to 44 months in prison after he admitted to punching a police officer in the head, and Rasha Abual-Ragheb, also of New Jersey, who was sentenced to three years of probation and two months of home detention after pleading guilty to the parading misdemeanor. Plea deals significantly restrict a defendant’s ability to appeal; one of the only arguments they’re allowed to raise is that their lawyer was ineffective. All three cases are in the early stages of the appeal process.The crimes
 


Weapons that prosecutors say rioters brought with them or improvised, and in some cases used on police: guns, knives, bats, chemicals, stolen police gear, flagpoles, a “Trump 2020” sign, pieces of metal and wood, crutches, a skateboard, stun devices, a crowbar, and a firecracker. Advertisement     
 


Rioters engaged in violent clashes throughout the afternoon with officers from the US Capitol Police, the DC police force, and other federal agencies who responded to the scene. Police body camera videos made public as part of the prosecutions have provided harrowing first-person footage of the physical and verbal assaults on officers that day. The US attorney’s office has put the number of cases involving allegations of attacking or interfering with officers at more than 225, including those in which defendants are charged with the broader offense of civil disorder.
 


The assault on the Capitol was a mob event, but the overwhelming majority of defendants are being prosecuted as individuals. In a few dozen cases, however, prosecutors have presented evidence alleging that clusters of rioters planned to take action to disrupt Congress’s certification of the election. In addition to the Oath Keepers conspiracy case, which has steadily added more defendants over the past year, there are conspiracy cases involving purported members of other far-right groups, including the Proud Boys and the Three Percenters.
 


On Jan. 12, Michael Sherwin, then the acting US attorney in Washington, told reporters that his office had created strike teams to build cases involving more serious crimes related to the insurrection, including seditious conspiracy. But no one has been charged yet with sedition or the separate offense of insurrection; both are rarely brought charges, and the government would almost certainly face legal challenges to their use. Nearly 300 people have been charged with obstructing an official proceeding, a felony that can carry significant prison time. Advertisement     
 


The FBI continues to search for suspects in connection with pipe bombs found midday on Jan. 6 outside the respective headquarters of the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee. The feds have offered a $100,000 reward for information that leads to an identification and have repeatedly promoted surveillance footage of a person seen wearing a sweatshirt and carrying a bag the night before.
 


Charging papers are full of social media posts and other alleged statements by defendants denouncing former vice president Mike Pence for what they believed was his betrayal of former president Donald Trump. But some of the most violent language was reserved for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Charging papers describe alleged rioters asking where they could find Pelosi or bragging later about going into her office. In the case of Pauline Bauer of Pennsylvania, prosecutors said she was captured on a police body camera saying words to the effect of, ""Bring Nancy Pelosi out here now. We want to hang that fucking bitch.” Steven Billingsley of Ohio was allegedly recorded on video saying, “No, we do want to hurt Pelosi. I do. Yeah, I would hang her from that big— You see that tree over there? We'd put a rope and hang her.” Richard Barnett of Arkansas was photographed with a foot on a desk in Pelosi’s office, and left a handwritten note that read, “Hey Nancy Bigo was here biotch [sic].”
 


The most common felonies are for obstructing an official proceeding, which carries a maximum of 20 years in prison, and assaulting police, which carries varying maximum penalties — as little as 1 year or as much as 20 years — depending on the extent of the violence, whether a weapon was used, or if other felony crimes were involved.
 


The vast majority of defendants are facing the same four base misdemeanor charges: illegally entering a restricted area, disorderly conduct in a restricted area, disorderly conduct in the Capitol, and parading or demonstrating in the Capitol. The first two counts carry up to a year behind bars, and the second two have maximum sentences of six months incarceration. Advertisement     The logistics
 


The federal district court in Washington has marshaled all of its resources to handle the flood of Capitol riot prosecutions, spreading the hundreds of cases across all of the active judges as well as senior judges (judges who are semiretired and can take lower caseloads). The latest available court statistics show that by September 2021, the number of new criminal cases filed in DC over the previous year had gone up by 83.9% compared to the year leading up to September 2020. President Joe Biden’s two nominees to the DC district court so far, Judges Florence Pan and Jia Cobb, were confirmed in the fall and have slowly started taking on cases.
 


Fights over which defendants should stay in jail after being arrested offered early perspective on how prosecutors were assessing the ongoing danger posed by alleged rioters and how judges were thinking about these cases. Some prominent conservatives, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, have described incarcerated defendants as “political prisoners,” but the majority of people in pretrial detention are charged with assaulting police. The rest are either facing other serious felony charges, had their bond revoked for violating release conditions, or are in custody on unrelated criminal charges.
 


Evan Neumann, charged with assaulting police at the Capitol, fled the United States and is seeking asylum in Belarus. Michael Adams of Virginia, charged with misdemeanors for going into the Capitol, was arrested in April and released while his case was pending. He failed to appear for a July status hearing, however, and the judge issued a bench warrant for his arrest; he was also facing a warrant as of May for an unrelated offense in Virginia. His location remains unknown, according to his lawyer. A federal grand jury returned an indictment in July charging Jonathan Pollock of Florida with multiple counts of assaulting police at the Capitol; he has not been arrested. Advertisement     
 


On June 1, a prosecutor filed a notice in court that they were dropping charges filed in January against Christopher Kelly of New York. To support the original complaint, the FBI presented information provided by a confidential source about Facebook messages purportedly sent by Kelly that suggested he’d gone into the Capitol. A search warrant for the Facebook account yielded messages about being at the Capitol; charging papers against Kelly also featured two photos of a person identified as Kelly standing outside. A few months later, it appeared the government had revisited the strength of the evidence. In dismissing the case, the prosecutor wrote: “[U]pon reflection of the facts currently known to the government, the government believes that dismissal without prejudice at this time serves the interests of justice.” Kelly’s lawyer told BuzzFeed News in an email that his client “never entered the Capitol building at any time. This was completely contrary to the charges he faced so the Government had to dismiss.”
 


No defendant has succeeded yet in convincing a judge to toss out the charges against them. In a series of long-awaited decisions in December, five judges presiding over six different cases — including two conspiracy cases involving members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, and one involving a person charged with bringing a firearm to the Capitol — rejected legal challenges to the government’s decision to bring the felony charge of obstructing an official proceeding in connection with the events of Jan. 6. These rulings came from a collection of judges whose pathways to the bench were politically diverse: two were nominated by Trump and the other three by former president Barack Obama. (Two defendants have died while their cases were pending.)
 


No one charged in connection with Jan. 6 has gone to trial yet, but dates are on the calendar in several dozen cases, including the Oath Keepers conspiracy case. Two defendants are set for trial as early as February: Robert Gieswein of Colorado, who is charged with repeatedly assaulting police with chemical spray and wielding a baseball bat as he made his way to the Capitol, and Guy Reffitt of Texas, who is charged with bringing a handgun to the Capitol. Advertisement     
 


Trump was impeached by the Democrat-led House of Representatives for inciting the insurrection, but he was acquitted in February after a trial in the Senate. He hasn’t faced criminal charges. Hoping to find some other legal route to hold him accountable, Democrats in Congress and police officers who responded to the riots have filed civil lawsuits, arguing that he conspired to interfere with the certification of the election and that he’s liable for the physical and emotional injuries they sustained. A judge is set to hear arguments on Jan. 10 on motions filed by Trump’s initial push to get three of these cases tossed out. ●

191,"One year later, we still know shockingly little about the eerie and unsolved case of the Jan. 6 insurrection pipe bombs.","


What if, later today, you found a pipe bomb outside? And what if the bomb were real, not some hoax or mistake? And what if the bomb had been there for hours — maybe you’d cut through an alley and walked right near it, or maybe you’d even passed the bomber with your dog on a normal night on your own street, and not even known that explosives were inches away from your body?What if the bomb was outside your office, and there was another one, at the office up the street?What if, in the absence of resolution, the only reasonable conclusion is that the bomb was meant for you?That’s exactly a situation that’s unfolded in Washington. For four months, the FBI and reporters have posted silent, eerie, looping security footage of an “unknown individual” in a hoodie and Nike Air Max Speed Turfs, walking the nighttime streets of Capitol Hill — in an alley, then out, stopping, then gone. Authorities believe this person placed pipe bombs at both the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters on the evening of Jan. 5. There are urgent ads with grainy screengrabs of the person around the city asking for information, and escalating rewards alongside direct-to-camera appeals. “No arrests have been made,” Washington police Chief Robert Contee said Wednesday during a congressional hearing. “No suspects have been identified.” Advertisement  One Democrat described every job she’d ever had as preparing her for different points of her life and career, with an exception. “I don’t think anyone at the DNC would tell you that they were prepared to be a target,” she said. “It was, frankly... No one can prepare you for that.”At midday on Jan. 6, a woman running an errand happened to spot what looked like a bomb outside the RNC and told the building’s security guards. “Holy shit, it is a bomb,” she overheard one shout.
 


“I'll never forget this as long as I live,” a Republican official said in a recent interview. He’d been walking into a meeting in Florida, where the committee was holding events, and received a call from the party’s operations head, even before the cops arrived. “Hey.” A pause. “We have to evacuate the building. I'm letting you know. It’s currently happening. There was a device found outside.”“I was like, ‘OK. Do we know anything about it yet?’”“It’s definitely a bomb.”“I’m trying to wrap my head around this — like, maybe he’s wrong!”In Washington, waves of police and federal officials descended on the RNC: the bomb squad, the FBI, dogs, everything. They evacuated the entire block, including the few dozen Republican staffers there that day. At that point on Jan. 6, a person waiting outside the buildings said, people were still getting off the Metro and walking around with kids in strollers, just a few blocks away from the east side of the Capitol. Then, watching it all unfold, she noticed something strange: “sirens going past us instead of toward us.”The rally to pressure Congress into overturning Donald Trump’s election defeat had become a mob, barreling into and past police barricades — broadcast in real time, blood spilling on the white steps — as senators spoke inside the Capitol about certifying the results. This is the forward-rewind unfolding of the insurrection: making sense of the entire situation took hours, then deepened with days, and is still hard to process in full. The cop getting crushed in the doorway, the crowd chanting “hang Mike Pence,” the rioters beating another cop with Americans flags, the video of lawmakers hustling toward elevators. As the woman waiting outside the RNC that day put it, “Only in retrospect did you place yourself in time.” Advertisement  
 


That afternoon, they'd locate a second bomb at the DNC, the police would evacuate some of the congressional office buildings, the authorities would detonate the bombs, the media would begin reporting about the devices. The Democrat said she’d actually heard that the bomb was really a bomb from the news — nearly everyone was working remotely because of the pandemic, and the day was chaotic. It had begun differently, busily: Democrats were celebrating Georgia senate wins the night before and working on Merrick Garland’s nomination that day.“I remember hearing from CNN and others, I think CNN was reporting it as breaking news that these were actual pipe bombs,” the Democrat said. “It was shocking when it was an actual bomb.” Advertisement  One way of considering the party committees is as a barometer of political health in American society: It’s not good. Over the last half-decade, they’ve become places where you might experience conspiracy theories, real email hacks, and finally, actual bombs. And you don’t have to particularly like the RNC or DNC to not want the people who work there to die in an explosion. If you talk to some political operatives — and this is a sample of just a few people, not everyone — you may find either a wearied acceptance or real anxiety. “You learn how to deal with them, and that sounds like a terrible thing, but you communicate, you stay in contact with the security officials,” the Democrat said about “suspicious packages” and threats, and the way it can be complicated and time-consuming to fully understand what’s going on. But, she also said, “something just this scary hasn’t happened to us where we had a real bomb outside of the building.”After a decade that included the WikiLeaks nightmare in 2016 and congressional baseball shooting in 2017, many political entities have added all manner of security protocol, both digital and physical. Only weeks before Jan. 6, the RNC upgraded its security cameras; some of the first images of the bomb suspect came from their footage. These days, they also have a system that can blast emergency alerts to employees simultaneously three different ways, as in: “RNC important message: Capitol Police are investigating a security concern near RNC headquarters in DC. Please remain away from the building.”“Is that now?” one of the Republicans said recently when it was read to him.That was the first alert the party sent on Jan. 6 at 1:32 p.m., as police and operations personnel cleared the building. Advertisement  The Democrat said she experienced the strange displacement of not being physically near colleagues because of the pandemic, which on the one hand, was good, given the nature of the problem. On the other, “We weren’t together, and we haven't been together for about a year now, right?”
 


There still is no way of knowing if the explosives had anything to do with the attack on the Capitol, or if it was a horrific coincidence; there aren’t any known suspects. There has, however, been an effort to minimize the chaos of the day. Since January, Trump has said little about the violence or the threat of more on Jan. 6 — including the bombs — all of it directed toward lawmakers, police officers, or fellow citizens. He still sends statements about how the election was stolen from him and has remarked that people like Pence didn’t do enough to help him — writing from a place where there will seemingly never be resolution or regret. In his wake, other Republican politicians and supporters have advanced the idea that the people inside the Capitol might not have been pro-Trump, or that the event everyone watched on TV might not have been that bad; others have opted to just move on. “I don't think anybody is questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election,” Kevin McCarthy said outside the White House on Wednesday, as Trump continues questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election. “I think that is all over with.”Meanwhile, one of the Republicans I spoke with remains shaken by something that happened on Jan. 6, unrelated to the pipe bombs or bombing suspect. As you may have seen, police arrested an Alabama man with 11 Molotov cocktails, lots of ammo, and handwritten notes about specific public officials. Police claim that when the man returned to his parked truck that evening, he told them that the mason jars in his truck contained a specific mixture of chemicals that works like napalm. For the Republican, just the idea of a weapon like that, used against anyone... Advertisement  “The stuff blows up, it would stick to their skin, like burn their skin off. OK, like, wow. That’s something,” he said, with emotion. “For people you don’t even know, that’s something.”As bad as Jan. 6 was, and nothing can really compare to multiple deaths and the visual of the smoky Capitol, the prevailing takeaway when you think hard about the day and closely examine the videos and details is how much worse it could have been: What if police hadn't evacuated lawmakers? But it’s true even in accidental ways. What if someone had kicked one of the bombs? What if nobody had found them, and a bomb exploded on Jan. 8 during the national security panic we were already having? Imagine if someone had rear-ended the truck with this homemade napalm inside.One detail that got a little lost in the overlapping chaos and compressed timelines: The police found the Molotov cocktails when they evacuated all the buildings around the RNC; he had parked on a side street nearby. ● Advertisement

192,“Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?” President Joe Biden asked during a speech at the US Capitol.,"


One year after former president Donald Trump's supporters tried to overturn an election, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a dire warning at the scene of the attack: The threat to democracy and the potential for political violence continues, driven by new, Republican-led voter restrictions across the country.“Those who stormed this Capitol, and those who instigated and incited, and those who called on them to do so, held a dagger at the throat of America and American democracy,” Biden said. “They didn’t come here out of patriotism or principle. They came here in rage."" Advertisement     He asked: ""Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?""Both Biden and Harris emphasized how, in the aftermath of the attempted insurrection, the fragility of American democracy and the need to actively defend it has been clear, evoking hard-won battles for the vote by Black civil rights leaders.""If we do not defend it,” Harris said, “Democracy simply will not stand.""One year on, there are hundreds of criminal cases stemming from the riot winding their way through the court system. Far-right extremism continues to adapt and worm its way into the mainstream. And Republicans continue to push conspiracy theories around the election and stall voting rights reforms in the Senate. Advertisement     “New laws are being written not to protect the vote but to deny it,” Biden said. ""Not only to suppress the vote but to subvert it. Not to strengthen and protect our democracy. Because the former president lost, instead of looking at election results from 2020 and saying they need new ideas or better ideas to win more votes, the former president and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections. It’s wrong. It’s undemocratic.”He continued: “Let's speak plainly about what happened in 2020. Even before the first ballot was cast, the former president was preemptively sowing doubt about the election results.""Biden and Harris made the case that the Jan. 6 attack was not only a physical threat to democracy but that the election denial ideology behind the attack also spurred a series of voter restriction bills from Republican legislators across the country.In the past year, 19 states have passed laws that restrict voter access, on the same basis that drove hundreds, including groups of white supremacists, to storm the Capitol grounds, assault and demean police officers, and hunt for elected officials while a gallows hung on the Capitol lawn: the false narrative, pushed by Trump, that Biden stole the election.Biden called Trump out in his address on Thursday morning, pointing to his actions spurring on the attackers on Jan. 6 and his continued attempts to spread misinformation and inflame election denial conspiracy theories.“For the first time in our history, a president not just lost an election. He tried to prevent a peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob reached the Capitol. But they failed. They failed,” Biden said.“His bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution,” he said. ""He cannot accept that he lost.""Harris compared the need to defend democracy from extremists today to the blood spilled in the battle for civil rights in decades past.“What they sought to degrade and destroy was not only a building,” she said. “What they were assaulting were the institutions, the values, the ideals that generations of Americans have marched, picketed, and shed blood to establish and defend.” Advertisement     “On Jan. 6, we all saw what our nation would look like if the forces who seek to dismantle our democracy are successful,” Harris said.“The 'big lie' didn't just drive the insurrection,” said Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice. ""It has driven a wave of anti-voter laws across the country, laws to restrict voting and pull cut back on voting rights and laws to change who does the counting — sabotage on top of voter suppression.""Waldman said Biden has been “more muted than would have been ideal” about voting rights and the threats to democracy over the past year, but that he sees the president being more proactive now: between his remarks this week and plans to travel to Georgia next week specifically to talk about voting rights reform.Voting rights advocates said it was important to hear Biden clearly and specifically condemn anti-democratic forces. But they ultimately have their eyes on key voting rights legislation.Protecting American democracy, voting rights advocates said, means going beyond holding those responsible for Jan. 6 responsible for their actions — the real goal is passing those voter protection measures, which a majority of Republicans in the Senate oppose. Biden directly pointing to voting reform bills as a means to stem the tide of anti-voter access bills underwritten by election denial ideology was a welcome sign to voting rights advocates.“Republicans will say, Oh, he's politicizing this solemn day of remembrance or whatever,” Waldman said. “Every major speech by presidents that are effective at a moment like this have a political purpose,” he added, referring to the Gettysburg Address and Bill Clinton’s speech after the Oklahoma City bombing, a right-wing terrorist attack.On the eve of the anniversary, Rev. Leah Daughtry, campaign manager with Fighting for Our Vote, said that she wanted to see Biden make a clear connection between the events of Jan. 6 and the need for voting rights protection to counter the ongoing threats to elections and democracy in the US.“I want to see Joe Biden remind us of who we are, of what our principles are, what our higher calling is, and then I want to see him tie that to the existential threat that we have right now,” Daughtry said. “That we shouldn't take for granted that what happened on Jan. 6 can never happen again. That he is fully committed with everything that he and the administration has to ensure that our voting rights are protected.” Advertisement     Two bills, the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, would represent the most significant defenses to voters' rights since the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965. The first bill would set national standards for elections, outlaw gerrymandering, enshrine the right to vote by mail, and standardize voter ID laws. The second would reestablish antidiscrimination protections stripped away from the Voting Rights Act by two Supreme Court decisions in recent years, which has left voters of color, in particular, vulnerable to having their access to voting cut off by state and local officials.“In response to Jan. 6, it would stop the voter suppression wave,” Waldman said.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer urged the Senate to pass voting rights reforms in response to Jan. 6 in a ""Dear Colleague"" letter on Monday.“January 6th was a symptom of a broader illness — an effort to delegitimize our election process and the Senate must advance systemic democracy reforms to repair our republic or else the events of that day will not be an aberration — they will be the new norm,” Schumer wrote.Senate Democrats support both bills — but that’s not enough to get past Republicans, in an evenly divided Senate where it takes 60 votes to pass any legislation because of the filibuster. The current challenge for Biden and Senate Democrats is to convince Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema to support changes to Senate procedure that would provide an exception to filibuster rules, preventing Republicans from shooting down voting rights legislation.“I mean, it's just been a series of unfortunate events and fumbles,” New Georgia Project CEO Nsé Ufot said about how the Biden administration has handled the voting reform bills.While voting rights advocates acknowledge that Biden may not have more forcefully called out Republicans for stalling voting reform — the way activists have — because he may need them on his side to pass other aspects of his agenda, Ufot said she’s disappointed he hasn’t used his years of experience and relationships in the Senate to push harder for voting rights bills. Advertisement     “I did not serve four decades in the United States Senate. I can't whip votes. I can't get my former colleagues to get rid of the filibuster. They can,” she said. “So there are things that I can and should be doing, as an organizer, as an activist, as a citizen. And there are things that only the president of the United States can do.”Daughtry, by contrast, said she thought Biden has been forceful already in pushing for the bills. ""I want to see him continue to double down with his colleagues, his former colleagues in the Senate, to put the full resources of the administration to work in ensuring that we can pass voting rights legislation,"" she said.“The buck stops with the United States Senate, and they've got to do their jobs to preserve democracy,” Daughtry said. “It is not the president's job alone.”

193,Hundreds of Facebook moderators at the company’s Mountain View campus can now work from home after their employer Accenture reversed an unpopular return-to-work mandate.,"


Hundreds of Facebook contractors who were ordered to return to the company’s Mountain View campus this month amid an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases were told today that they can continue working from home, an abrupt reversal of a company mandate.Following a BuzzFeed News inquiry, Accenture, a subcontractor that manages content moderation for Facebook, walked back its late December demand that moderators return to work in Mountain View on Jan. 24. The policy change was set against a backdrop of worker dissent as contractors openly questioned why they had to report to the office when full-time Facebook employees could defer their return by several months. Multiple moderators threatened to resign if health exemptions continued to be denied for vulnerable contractors. Advertisement     Contractors were told verbally on Wednesday morning that the return to work was being delayed.In response to a detailed list of questions, a spokesperson said that given current health data “we have let our team members working from home know they should continue to do so.”""We work collaboratively with our people on individual accommodations, including work from home, in compliance with all applicable employment laws and local regulations,"" the spokesperson added.
 


In a late December staff call, Accenture told a team of hundreds embedded at one of the social network’s California headquarters that they must return to the office on Jan. 24. Employees who subsequently requested special consideration for being immunocompromised or protecting vulnerable family members were not given exemptions. “Once the return to office is complete for Meta, there unfortunately will not be work that can be done from home on this project,” those who inquired were told in a boilerplate email. The announcement came just weeks after Facebook’s parent company, Meta, told full-time employees that they could defer their return to work for three to five months amid a flurry of similar actions by companies like Google and Apple.Accenture’s return-to-office mandate would have affected a building of roughly 400 people tasked with reviewing and flagging for removal the worst of what’s posted to Facebook. Some said the decision underscored the lesser treatment of Facebook contractors.“It’s unconscionable and I’m just sick of it,” one contractor told BuzzFeed News, speaking on the condition of anonymity as they are forbidden from speaking publicly about Facebook or Accenture matters.
 


In response to a series of detailed questions, a Meta spokesperson said the company will “continue to prioritize everyone's health and safety” as it works to get teams back into the office.Contractors claim quarters are too cramped to properly social distance. (Previously, moderators worked out of two buildings leased by Facebook, but as of last year were consolidated into a single facility.) One contractor told BuzzFeed News that Accenture’s COVID protocols require them to remain 3 feet apart at all times. “But that’s a lie because each desk is 1 foot apart,” they said. Workers are also concerned about using elevators, which are limited to four people at staggered intervals but are workers’ only mode of traveling between floors, as stairwells have been completely closed off. One contractor said the elevator limits are not really being enforced. Facebook and Accenture both declined to comment on these matters.Internal emails viewed by BuzzFeed News show that several Facebook contractors tested positive for COVID in December. As of Monday, the number of cases was reportedly as high as 34 people. Contractors said they only learned about the total number of cases by talking to their coworkers, as communications regarding infections are limited to affected floors. Facebook and Accenture declined to comment on the number of COVID cases among contract workers.Contractors told BuzzFeed News that COVID sick leave, which entailed two weeks of regular pay for employees who tested positive for the virus, stopped being offered in September. Facebook contractors in Mountain View also do not receive hazard pay, and in October 2020, hundreds of Facebook workers signed a petition demanding paid leave for moderators at the company’s Austin offices, Motherboard reported.Contractors who test positive for COVID or suspect they might have COVID ""are paired with a case worker to ensure that they have access to a comprehensive range of benefits and support, including paid time off, while they are recovering,"" an Accenture spokesperson said.But sources within the company told BuzzFeed News that connecting with COVID support services has been difficult at times, and that they do not wish to use PTO in lieu of designated sick leave. Contractors said an online portal for submitting accommodation requests is also not functional, and called Accenture's larger support system a ""broken cycle."" Accenture has not replied to a request for comment on these claims. Advertisement     ""There's no submit or continue button after putting in all the information,"" one worker said. ""Prior to putting any information in, though, it does mention talk to your supervisor. But the supervisor will tell you to email HR. But HR will send that link.""
 


On internal company message boards viewed by BuzzFeed News, Facebook employees and contractors criticized Accenture’s handling of COVID infections in its offices and lack of sick leave for moderators. Workers expressed confusion over how to alert the company should they test positive for COVID and objected to being told to use personal vacation hours to recover.The US set a global record on Monday with 1 million new COVID cases reported in a single day. In California, the state’s Department of Health reported more than 230,000 new COVID cases on Tuesday.Prior to Accenture’s policy change, nearly a dozen contractors publicly and privately expressed their intent to resign rather than return to work. Contractors told BuzzFeed News that Accenture and Facebook were unresponsive to their requests for personal exemptions.“Regular Facebook employees can go back at their leisure,” one contractor said. “Contractors, as always, know they’re treated as second-class citizens.”

194,"The government released new photos of Wu-Tang Clan’s legendary Once Upon A Time In Shaolin, but says the price it got is a “trade secret.”","


The US government claims that the price it got for the legendary sole copy of Wu-Tang Clan’s Once Upon a Time in Shaolin is a “trade secret” that cannot be revealed, according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News.The album was originally purchased for about $2 million by pharmaceutical executive and hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli in 2015. When he was convicted of securities fraud in 2018 and ordered to forfeit $7.36 million, US marshals seized the album along with other assets. Advertisement     Last July, the Justice Department announced it had found a buyer for the album but didn’t identify the individual or the price. Attorney Peter Scoolidge told the New York Times that digital art collective PleasrDAO purchased the album from the US government for $4 million. The documents say that the new buyers assume the same terms of Shkreli’s purchase agreement. They may display the presentation box embedded with the Wu-Tang Clan logo, which was designed by British Moroccan artist Yahya Rouach, but they are prohibited from making copies of the album.
 


According to a copy of the five-page purchase agreement, the album was ""sealed with “tamper-proof evidence tape” and delivered to the new owners “in that state.”The new documents, which were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, include dozens of previously undisclosed photographs of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin. The album, conceived by the rap group as a work of art, is held in a nickel silver box stored in a cedarwood box and covered in black cow leather with light beige velvet lining. It also includes a 175-page leather-bound lyric book and a gold-leafed certificate of authenticity. The government redacted images of the two CDs, the song titles and the lyric book citing ""trade secrets.""Wu-Tang Clan said the choice to produce only one copy of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin was a form of protest of the way music had been devalued in the digital era.Neither Scoolidge nor representatives for Wu-Tang Clan responded to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News. On March 9 2018, after Shkreli was ordered to forfeit the album, Scoolidge sent a letter to the federal prosecutor on the case that said “any transfer of ‘Once Upon a Time in Shaolin’ by Mr. Shkreli to any third party is restricted substantially by the terms of the September 3, 2015 Purchase Agreement through which Mr. Shrkeli obtained the work.”At the time, Scoolidge represented Tarik “Cilvaringz” Azzougarh, a co-producer of the album who owned a 50 percent share of the master recordings. The letter said Azzourgarh was prepared to litigate to stop the forfeiture of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin because the transfer of the album to the US government violated the terms of the contract Shkreli entered into when he bought it. Azzourgarh's name was redacted from the letter but a source familiar with it confirmed it was him.“The United States and its agencies cannot take greater property rights from Mr. Shkreli than were granted by my client in the Purchase Agreement,” said the letter released by the Justice Department Wednesday. Azzourgarh ""is prepared to file a petition under the forfeiture order to protect his rights in the work. Please advise if you are open to potentially working out an agreement with my client and Mr. Shkreli that protects my client’s rights so that we can avoid the need to burden"" the federal judge that ordered the forfeiture. Advertisement     It appears Scoolidge and federal prosecutors were working on an agreement for more than a year. On Dec. 20, 2019, the associate general counsel in the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York sent Scoolidge a letter indicating the government was gearing up to sell Once Upon a Time in Shaolin and needed guidance on how to do that without violating the terms of Shkreli's original purchase agreement.RZA, the de facto leader of the rap group, told a New York radio station last year he regretted selling the album to Shkreli. But since the government’s sale to PleasrDAO, RZA said he believes the album is in better hands.

195,"“The threat of extremism today is perhaps less obvious… But what’s happening is gravely serious,” one expert said.","


Far-right domestic extremists like those who attacked the US Capitol a year ago have faced criminal charges from law enforcement and crackdowns from social media companies. But they have not gone away.On the contrary, they have evolved and adopted new strategies while regrouping, recruiting, and muscling their way into the mainstream with worrying success, experts say. And their ranks are growing.“Many of us thought these groups would splinter and fall apart and go underground after the FBI started going after them. But that hasn’t really been the case,” Heidi Beirich, cofounder and chief strategy officer of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, a nonprofit focused on transnational hate and far-right movements, told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement     Indeed, as the country marks the anniversary of one of the darkest days in American history and prepares for the consequential midterm elections in the fall — where extremists, such as MAGA supporters, could again try to undermine the will of voters — extremism researchers and government officials are warning that homegrown extremists pose a greater threat to our democracy than they did before Jan. 6, 2021. They just look a bit different now.“The threat of domestic extremism today is perhaps less obvious. We’re not seeing the Proud Boys organize massive marches in Washington, DC, or militias storming capitol buildings every weekend. But what’s happening is gravely serious,” Jared Holt, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, told BuzzFeed News.In a new report published Tuesday, Holt wrote that domestic extremists were “battered by the blowback [they] faced after the Capitol riot, but not broken by it. In fact, the sentiments espoused by domestic extremist causes are as public and insidious as ever.” Far-right extremists, he told BuzzFeed News, are increasingly seeking legitimacy by latching onto mainstream conservative causes; they are taking a decentralized approach, preferring to operate in small groups or cells; and they are switching their focus from national actions to hyperlocal initiatives, like focusing on school board and city council meetings.There have been several reports in recent months about far-right extremists and conspiracy theorists, including members of the neo-fascist street gang the Proud Boys, showing up and intimidating officials making decisions on health measures and school initiatives at community meetings.Holt’s report highlights how extremists’ ideas are increasingly finding fertile ground among disaffected conservatives and leading voices in the Republican Party who are teaming with them to fight “culture wars” on topics like vaccines, race, and education.Beirich said that shift is a serious cause for alarm.“When I look back at the last year, the thing that I find most astounding isn’t really about the groups we’d label extremist — it’s about what’s happened with the Republican party… The infiltration of extremists into its ranks,” she said. Advertisement     
 


She cited extremist and white supremacist ideas such as the “great replacement theory” — the false idea that white people are being purposely replaced by nonwhite immigrants — being peddled by GOP politicians and Fox News commentators as evidence of the radicalization of the conservative right and “extremism going mainstream.”“I’m hard-pressed to even call them fringe ideas anymore,” she said. “They’re not confined to extremists. You can’t call it a fringe idea; it’s a mainstream idea among conservatives.”The experts’ concerns were backed Tuesday by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who said that authorities over the past year “have improved and strengthened our approach to combating this dynamic, evolving threat.”In the wake of the pro-Trump mob attack on the Capitol, President Joe Biden made combating domestic violent extremism one of his top priorities and enlisted leaders across government agencies to help. Department of Justice and FBI officials, in particular, have led the charge. They have testified in front of Congress on several occasions about the threat posed by extremists, particularly those on the far-right side of the political spectrum. With Jan. 6, they are at the forefront of not only the festering extremist problem but also one of the largest criminal investigations in US history.More than 700 people, including several with military experience and many associated with white supremacist and anti-government extremist groups like the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and Three Percenters, have been charged in the sweeping federal probe into the Capitol attack that was blamed for the deaths of five people and dozens more injuries. The images of the rioters stomping on Capitol police officers, crashing through barricades, bashing in windows with poles adorned with the American Flag, and storming the halls of Congress are seared into the American consciousness. Advertisement     While the Biden administration has made some strides in the fight against domestic violent extremists, Mayorkas said the threat of them remains “very grave.”Some experts think the US government was slow to respond and will have trouble tackling the problem of extremism.Beirich said authorities should have taken steps a decade ago to quash the rise of far-right extremism and white nationalism, “when this stuff really was on the fringe [and] it could have had a massive impact.”Now, with it so deeply entrenched in the mainstream political right and white supremacist and anti-government groups backing them up with threats of violence, she fears it may be too late to turn the tide.“If 2024 is contested like 2020 was,” she added, referring to the upcoming midterm elections, “we’re going to have major civil unrest in this country.”

196,Let's talk about Netflix's Don't Look Up.,"


Tomi Obaro: On Christmas Eve, Netflix dropped Don’t Look Up, a star-studded satire about two scientists played by Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio who discover a comet hurtling toward a very indifferent Earth. Written and directed by Adam McKay (The Big Short), the film was one of Netflix’s most-watched movies ever. But reception has been mixed. Let’s discuss!First things first, who actually liked this movie?Jason Wells: Me.Scaachi Koul: I liked it, but I also had the benefit of zero expectation.Stephanie McNeal: I also liked it!Elamin Abdelmahmoud: I can’t relate to the “mixed” reception, because I had a good time. But because of how we talk on the internet, sometimes simply saying you liked something comes across as suggesting that this is, like, the top Oscar contender for the year. Don’t Look Up is… fine. It’s fine. I had a good time. Advertisement     OK, I guess I am alone in finding the film extremely unsubtle and an absolute slog to get through. For the folks who like the movie, why?JW: I did not come into this expecting whatever I think others were — give yourself over to the camp and enjoy the spectacle. Netflix clearly spent a shit ton on this thing and it showed, bad bangs and all.SK: I’m a big advocate for movies that press on the pleasure centers of our brains, even if those movies aren’t actually any “good.” Didn’t Don’t Look Up do its job? A weird Ariana Grande song, Jennifer Lawrence in a haircut that is a direct affront to God, forcing Leonardo DiCaprio to pretend he’s married to a woman his own age, Jonah Hill with a Birkin. Come on. Don’t be greedy. You can’t ask for more.SM: I thought it made the point it wanted to make and did so well. I also was fully entertained for the entire thing, which was super long. I just felt like it was a satire that worked for me, even though it made me kind of depressed because I think it hit too close to home.EA: Some folks don’t like to be lectured in their movies and television. Others are fans of Aaron Sorkin. I am the latter. I love a pedantic movie. This is Adam McKay’s third pedantic movie — The Big Short is basically a sentient angry Reddit post, and Vice is a sarcastic Wikipedia page, and god I love it. I love it! Sometimes, I want to watch things that not only confirm my worldview, but also actively kick other worldviews right in the gonads. But to give you perspective on the kind of person I am: I watched the entirety of Sorkin’s The Newsroom. Twice. I am sorry to say that I am the primary audience for Don’t Look Up.Some critics have expressed negative opinions about the film. In Manohla Dargis’s New York Times review, she notes that “McKay’s touch here is considerably blunter and less productive than it has been in a while” and even suggests that Meryl Streep’s character is kind of sexist. Alison Willmore (former BuzzFeeder!) writes in her Vulture review, “McKay’s movies are not particularly pointed in their satire and, as time has gone on, have increasingly settled into their preferred form of a harangue. He seems to believe that people need laughs and famous faces to be lured into thinking about more pressing matters, and he hates them for it.” Do you agree? Advertisement     JW: If you think it’s too on the nose, look in the mirror.SK: Isn’t that the point? I appreciated the raw nihilism of it; it’s not like the ending gives anyone much hope for the future, nor should it.EA: This movie would never work if the allegory was more subtle. What do you want, slowly rising sea levels and melting glaciers? To turn up the satirical absurdity, it needed to be directly on the nose. I mean, “Me and your father are for the jobs the comet will provide” — come on, that hits! You have a planet that’s warming at an alarming rate, and politicians asking how to create jobs fighting climate change?? The time for subtlety was, oh, maybe 20 years ago.SM: This seems overly nitpicking to me TBH.One incontestable fact is that the film is jam-packed with stars. Which cameo was your favorite?JW: It felt like everyone was a cameo in this, and I know Cate is getting a lot of ish, but when the comet is hitting and she said, “Honestly, I think I’d just rather drink and talk shit about people,” I saw myself.SK: Probably the little blip we got of Chris Evans, one of the top three Chrises for sure. I don’t think I even realized it was him until much, much later. I’m curious how you pay someone for a cameo that lasts, what, 20 seconds?EA: Gotta hand it to Kid Cudi! More Cudi in movies, please.SM: I think one of the reasons the movie worked is every person was very talented. I loved Jonah Hill and Meryl the most, probably.Which actor had the most impressive performance?JW: Every character was unlikeable, so kudos to them. But Meryl Streep took the cake. Thumbs up to her stylist.EA: Jonah Hill as the president’s son and chief of staff — extremely punchable behavior. I am never motivated to violence, so shouts to Jonah Hill for making me really hate his character.
 


For all the film’s star power, the wigs are horrendous. (Rob Morgan’s is a hate crime, as I have previously tweeted; Tyler Perry’s influence is undefeated!) Who had the worst wig?JW: Rob Morgan vs. Jennifer’s bangs.EA: I do not notice wigs, and even I shrieked at the Rob Morgan situation.SK: Pretty bummed about Meryl’s hair-in-a-can wig. Couldn’t someone have run a comb through it at least?SM: The Bezos/Musk tech guy character’s because he was so creepy.What was the most surprising thing about the film?JW: The total destruction of Earth??!! It was beautiful to behold.EA: I think beautiful is exactly the word here. That whole last sequence was so emotional and moving. Did I cry? Give me a raise and I’ll tell you.SK: Meryl’s lower back tat. Also, that she decided to do this movie in the first place. Good for her.JW: OMG yes. The lower back tat wins.SM: I personally didn’t see the “tech genius harvests the comet for money” thing coming, and it made me want to die.JW: Same. Although I didn’t see a lot of things coming in the movie, so by the time that happened I was just like, “OK.”Do we want more movies like this in 2022? Is the movie lecture having a moment?JW: It is, and I’m here for it.SK: I don’t know that it was really a lecture; to me, it felt more like a cry for help. A lecture suggests it would be more pointed, but instead it was just a reminder that everything is bad, all the time, on every planet, for the rest of time. But I’m not against more movies that just lean into despair — what are we doing, performing optimism? And for what????SM: Yes, because it was actually CREATIVE. It wasn’t a biopic or a remake or something. At least we can all say it wasn’t something that we had seen before.EA: For some of us, the movie lecture never went away. ●

199,"The decision means the top-ranked tennis player will likely miss the Australian Open. “They expect to be on the flight back home later in the day,” a source told BuzzFeed News.","


Australian authorities canceled the visa of the world's No. 1 tennis player, Novak Djokovic, on Thursday after he failed to provide appropriate proof regarding his exemption from rules requiring foreigners to be vaccinated, officials said.The decision was made after the Serbian player was questioned overnight at a Melbourne airport by federal officials amid widespread anger Down Under that he was granted a medical exemption from COVID vaccination to play at the Australian Open. Advertisement     “The visa for Novak Djokovic has been canceled,” Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said on the Australian breakfast news show Sunrise. “Obviously that follows a review of the exemption that was provided through the Victorian government process. They were looking at the integrity and the evidence behind it.”“It’s a matter for him whether he wishes to appeal that, but if a visa is canceled somebody will have to leave the country,” he added.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the decision was made out of the desire to continue to be vigilant in the pandemic.
 


A source told BuzzFeed News that Djokovic and his coaching team were still at the airport and planned to file a legal appeal, but they did not expect to be successful.“They expect to be on the flight back home later in the day,” the source said.The top-ranked singles tennis player, who is seeking a record 21st Grand Slam title, was quizzed by border officials for several hours after he landed late Wednesday Australian time.According to Reuters, his father told Serbian media that the player was made to wait alone in a room at the airport under ​​armed guard pending a final decision.“Not the most usual trip Down Under,” Djokovic coach Goran Ivanisevic posted on Instagram from the airport at around 5 a.m.
 


Djokovic’s beliefs and behavior have made headlines throughout the pandemic. In April 2020, he said he was opposed to vaccines and that he wouldn’t want to be required to receive a shot in order to travel. Just months later, he and his wife tested positive for COVID after he organized and played in exhibition matches that flouted social distancing recommendations. In October 2021, he said that questions about his vaccination status were “inappropriate.”The tournament’s defending champion had surprised many Tuesday when he posted on social media that he had been granted an “exemption permission” to travel to Australia. But, as Melbourne’s Age newspaper first reported, it was not clear whether Djokovic had brought sufficient evidence to prove his exemption reason.Under Australian law, foreigners traveling into the country must have a visa and be fully vaccinated. Tennis Australia and officials in Victoria, where Melbourne is located, made similar requirements for players who wanted to participate in the Open without first undertaking a mandatory 14-day quarantine. Advertisement     But Australian immunization officials had outlined some temporary vaccine exemptions for its citizens, which include people who have had a PCR-confirmed case of COVID in the last six months. It is not clear if these apply to foreigners seeking to enter Australia, but tennis officials had pointed to these exemptions in their decision to allow Djokovic to participate.That Djokovic was granted an exemption to play in Melbourne, which endured one of the longest lockdowns in the world as Australia sought to keep COVID cases at zero prior to widespread vaccination, caused a massive outcry in the country.Tennis and Victorian officials stressed his application had gone through a “double blind” review process, but large sections of the Australian public and media railed against the decision.“I don't care how good a tennis player he is. If he's refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn't be allowed in,” former Australian Medical Association vice president Stephen Parnis wrote on Twitter.Asked about the tennis player’s exemption at a press conference on Wednesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters Djokovic would need to ""provide acceptable proof"" for his claim that he couldn’t be vaccinated for medical reasons.""We await his presentation and what evidence he provides us to support that,"" Morrison said. ""If that evidence is insufficient, then he won't be treated any different to anyone else, and he'll be on the next plane home.""On Wednesday, Morrison’s government indicated that they would have a say on whether Djokovic would be allowed into the country.“While the Victorian Government and Tennis Australia may permit a non-vaccinated player to compete in the Australian Open, it is the Commonwealth Government that will enforce our requirements at the Australian border,” Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews said in a statement titled “Australia’s border rules apply to everyone.”“No individual competing at the Australian Open will be afforded any special treatment,” Andrews said.Hunt, the health minister, said the rules were tough but fair. ""Australians have had to do it tough,"" Hunt said, ""and Australians in many different states and territories have had to show their vaccination records in some cases to enter premises and cafés and other things, and it's not unreasonable to have exactly the same requirement for all who enter this country.""

200,"“People should not be in jail for imaginary crimes,” one expert said.","


Every year, police officers claim to have suffered near-fatal overdoses after accidentally touching fentanyl, a synthetic opioid more powerful than morphine or heroin.“Deputy Nearly Dies of Fentanyl Overdose,” read a headline from the Sacramento Bee this summer. “Officer Exposed to Fentanyl & Transported to Local Hospital,” stated a press release from the Santa Rosa Police Department in 2020. “Police Officer Overdoses After Brushing Fentanyl Powder Off His Uniform,” read the headline on a CNN story from 2017. Advertisement     But there’s something off about this seeming epidemic of accidental overdoses: It is virtually impossible to overdose simply by touching or getting too close to fentanyl. Doctors and toxicologists warn that the hype around this perceived threat is harming overdose victims, taxpayers, and first responders.Accidental overdose by skin exposure “is chemically and physically implausible,” said Dr. Ryan Marino, a medical toxicologist and addiction medicine specialist who serves as an assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.Dr. Andrew Stolbach, an emergency physician and medical toxicologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said, “It's not possible to overdose on fentanyl by touching it. If it was absorbed well through the skin, people wouldn’t inject it and snort it in order to get high.”Despite this, people who use the drug are facing serious legal repercussions — such as charges of assault or endangerment of officers — for supposedly causing these impossible overdoses.“People should not be in jail for imaginary crimes,” Marino said.
 


“Bad timing. Bad luck.”That’s how Justin Buckel describes what happened the night of May 12, 2017. He had just been released from jail on bond in East Liverpool, Ohio, when he was pulled over. The officer was quickly joined by Chris Green, a local police officer who was off duty but happened to be nearby.The officers searched Buckel’s car for drugs and found powder that later tested positive for fentanyl. Buckel said at the scene that the powder in the vehicle might include fentanyl. He was arrested. At least an hour later, Green complained to a colleague he didn’t feel well. He had brushed some powder off of his shirt, touching it with his bare skin. The colleague later recounted in police documents that Green “became saturated in sweat and was barely coherent.” Green told BuzzFeed News he remembers “panicking, trying to talk,” and falling forward, but nothing after that. He was taken to a hospital and treated for an overdose.Buckel pleaded guilty to charges including trafficking and possession and was sent to prison for six and a half years. In addition, he was charged with assault on a peace officer for “exposing” Green to fentanyl, which made up a year and a half of the jail time.When he was sentenced, the Ohio attorney general’s office put out a press release that led with the assault charge. Mike DeWine, who was attorney general at the time and is now governor, contributed a quote: ""Fentanyl is so dangerous that even the slightest exposure can be deadly, but thankfully in this case naloxone was close at hand.” (DeWine’s office told BuzzFeed News in a statement that Green’s overdose was a “documented, medical incident” and claimed it is “factually incorrect” that this overdose was medically implausible.) The news media picked the story up accordingly.
 


Buckel’s arrest was one of many similar stories that got national attention. The prevalence of these tales of accidental overdose has increased along with the amount of fentanyl in the illicit drug supply in the United States.A study published in the Harm Reduction Journal last year showed that stories of accidental fentanyl exposure made up over 150 media reports in 2017. Stolbach, the Johns Hopkins physician, was one of the authors of a 2020 Journal of Medical Toxicology study that traced the origin of the concern to a small number of reports from 2013, noting that such media reports increased in 2016, the same year the United States Drug Enforcement Agency itself issued a warning that “fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin or through accidental inhalation of airborne powder.”A DEA spokesperson confirmed the agency later took down an accompanying video warning of this supposed risk that was posted on YouTube and noted that the DEA follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for preventing occupational exposure to illicit drugs. More recent first responder guidance from the DEA says, “Incidental skin contact may occur during daily activities but is not expected to lead to harmful effects if the contaminated skin is promptly washed off with water.” Representatives for the agency did not respond to a request for comment on the 2016 warning.The Journal of Medical Toxicology study noted two distinct spikes in media reports about first responder opioid exposures in 2017. The bigger spike came in the second quarter of the year, the same time period Buckel was arrested.Green appeared on CBS News five days after Buckel’s arrest, when anchor Norah O’Donnell told viewers, “The opioid crisis is not only dangerous for those addicted to the drugs, but also for first responders.” An on-air graphic declared, “OVERDOSE BY ACCIDENT.” Representatives for CBS News did not respond to multiple requests for comment on whether medical experts were contacted for the story.A few months later, CBS’s fictional cop show Blue Bloods featured a harrowing plotline in which an officer was rushed to the hospital after touching a tray containing fentanyl. A suspect and doctor both proclaimed the officer had overdosed. Representatives for CBS did not respond in time for publication when asked whether toxicologists or other medical professionals were consulted about the episode. Over 8 million people watched it the night it premiered. Advertisement     Logically, the argument that passive fentanyl exposure poses an overdose risk to first responders falls apart with a little questioning. If it did, why don’t nurses who work with fentanyl in hospital settings experience similar symptoms? What about dealers, the loved ones of drug users, or volunteers at needle exchange sites?Experts have long warned that this pervasive concern can create serious consequences for drug users, first responders, and taxpayers. Marino said he has seen first responders hesitating to resuscitate patients experiencing fentanyl overdoses both in the hospital and in the field. The 2020 Harm Reduction Journal study pointed out that officers report entering the field with significant fear of fentanyl. A study published the previous year in Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness surveyed first responders in New York, finding that 80% of them believed “briefly touching fentanyl could be deadly.”
 


While many first responders clearly experience physical suffering after a believed exposure to fentanyl, experts suggest it’s possible they are experiencing panic attacks or “line-of-sight” afflictions, not overdoses, and are suffering negative consequences to their mental health. Some symptoms of opioid overdoses — such as perspiration and lightheadedness — are also associated with anxiety attacks.Ryan McNeil, an assistant professor of medicine and public health at Yale University, said first responder descriptions of suspected overdoses sound like panic attacks, not toxicity, and ""it's galling that we're treating that as an overdose when it's not even how an overdose presents."" Advertisement     In August, the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department came under fire for releasing a packaged PSA and insisting, even after an outcry from medical experts online, that it showed a deputy overdosing from passive fentanyl exposure.
 


The body camera footage is dramatic. Deputy David Faiivae falls to the ground after touching a powder, and one of his colleagues assures him, “I’m not going to let you die!” In the PSA, officers involved that day sit down for confessional-style interviews and Faiivae states, “I almost died.”What made this instance different from its predecessors was that doctors and experts organized to push back. Over 400 physicians, nurses, and public health researchers signed a letter demanding retractions from the major outlets that credulously repeated the department’s claim. They highlighted the 2017 findings of a joint American College of Medical Toxicology and American Academy of Clinical Toxicology task force, which found that “incidental dermal absorption is very unlikely to cause opioid toxicity,” and “toxicity cannot occur from simply being in proximity to the drug.”Under pressure, the department admitted the deputy never underwent a toxicology screening to determine if fentanyl was in his system, but they refused to disavow the video, even weeks later. A representative for the department confirmed to BuzzFeed News that Faiivae never underwent a toxicology screening and the organization has “not revisited this topic since that time.” They had no further comment. The story of the alleged overdose, dubious as it was, still spread. Green, who also says he is not sure he underwent a toxicology screening after his alleged overdose, posted an article about it to his own Facebook account.
 


Despite the very public myth-busting of fentanyl overdose from accidental contact with the drug, law enforcement officials across the country continue to go to great, very expensive lengths to avoid this “risk,” and people continue to face incarceration for supposedly causing these accidental overdoses.On Sept. 16, officials in Greene County, Tennessee, charged Tommy Starnes with two felony counts of reckless endangerment after a deputy and EMS worker both experienced “symptoms of an overdose” after treating him, according to a release from the Greene County Sheriff’s Department. Greene County Sheriff Wesley Holt would not share additional information with BuzzFeed News on what those symptoms entailed.Unlike Buckel, who was simultaneously hit with a variety of other trafficking-related charges, Starnes is not suspected of selling drugs. The first responders were called for an overdose. They were there to save Starnes’ life.Upon arriving at the scene after reports of the first responders’ symptoms, Holt donned a hazmat suit to retrieve evidence. The Tennessee Highway Patrol even flew in decontamination equipment by helicopter. Holt estimates the total cost of the response was around $3,800.Holt told BuzzFeed News it’s “a sad situation” that taxpayers foot those bills. When asked if he was aware of the research showing passive fentanyl exposure poses no significant risk to law enforcement officers (thus rendering the helicopter decontamination unnecessary), he said he was not. He dismissed the idea that the first responders experienced anxiety or a so-called nocebo effect — the opposite of a placebo effect, wherein a negative outcome arises from negative expectations — and declined to say whether the deputy or EMS worker who came in contact with Starnes were given toxicology screenings.Reporting by a local journalist later revealed that every officer in Greene County has been given a protective suit in the wake of Starnes’ arrest. Holt estimates that cost the department another $800. The reporting also said the ambulance used to transport Starnes was given “an intense cleaning” with chemicals flown in by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations. Representatives for the TBI did not say what that might have cost. Advertisement     Todd Estep, a public defender who represents Starnes, said he had not been aware of the body of research indicating that the endangerment his client was charged with is medically implausible until he was contacted by BuzzFeed News. Starnes, who also faces felony charges of possession, remains in jail awaiting an arraignment this month.
 


Green, like Holt, rejects the idea that any first responder’s reaction to the presence of fentanyl is brought on by anxiety or a nocebo effect. “I’m a pretty hardened guy,” he said. “Nothing really rattles me.” He is no longer with the ELPD. A review of internal documents showed he was terminated after a number of violations uncovered by an investigation ordered by East Liverpool Mayor Gregory Bricker, including dishonesty and discourteous treatment of the public. Green told BuzzFeed News he believes he was let go because he raised concerns about corruption in the department and is mounting a legal challenge to ensure “the facts will come out.”He has since found employment working in drug detection for a private company and told BuzzFeed News it is essentially the same job he had with the ELPD, but he makes “a ton more money.” Green is thrilled with his new gig, saying, “My passion is drugs. Like if I was allowed, I would literally be a cop for free if I could just hunt drugs and drug dealers all day.”He also dismissed doctors’ insistence that passive exposure cannot cause an overdose, saying, “I don't really care what the naysayers say or feel or whatever. I know what I experienced, and it's godawful.”It’s impossible to say for sure what is really going on in these instances, though Green and Holt both remain adamant that passive exposure is an overdose threat and the police are not lying or experiencing panic attacks. First responders, Green said, are either “really good actors and we have an elaborate hoax going on or the shit is real.” Advertisement     Stolbach, who helped author the 2017 position statement from the American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology task force, said that what happened in the San Diego Sheriff’s Department video showed “some sort of medical event, but not opioid-poisoning definitive.” He doesn’t know why the message that these types of overdoses are impossible isn’t taking hold in police departments, even years after the possibility of passive overdose was debunked.“Every police officer or police official that I personally come into contact with, they're on board with me and they understand, and yet, somehow, this message isn't penetrating the police,” he said, adding that between the medical and law enforcement communities, “there’s not a lot of interface.”Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University who is a former senior policy adviser to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, believes resistance to accurate information about the possibility of exposure overdoses isn’t just an issue among first responders. His concern lies with prosecutors.“It may not be an entirely rational process for them,” said Humphreys. “They could just be glad to have another way to charge people. Generally, as prosecutors, the more things you can charge somebody with, the more power you have, so even if they knew that this was mostly hysteria and hokum, they might still welcome the power. I don't know if you can change that.”Fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin, but only under unique circumstances. Fentanyl patches are used therapeutically by medical professionals all the time, which may have contributed to the belief that instantaneous absorption and subsequent overdose are possible.
 


“The fentanyl patch is not just fentanyl, so that is definitely completely different from what's on the streets. The patch is fentanyl combined with an alcohol or glycol product so that it becomes a solution and so those compounds do absorb through the skin,” said Marino, who explained that the 75-microgram patch does not contain “a big dose” and “takes 13 hours to get to just the therapeutic dose.” Overdosing, he said, would require “many, many hours of holding this patch against the skin.”Green told BuzzFeed News he used hand sanitizer before brushing the powder off of himself that day in 2017 and believes that could have facilitated some kind of absorption. Asked why he had a reaction but Buckel — who handled the powder too, which led to his conviction for tampering with evidence – didn’t, he said it was probably because Buckel used drugs and had a tolerance.Green also pointed out that another suspect arrested with Buckel was transported to the hospital before he was, though at the time, he questioned whether the suspect was trying to get out of jail. Green and the police report from the time both noted the suspect said he had asthma. Per the police report, the suspect experienced “shortness of breath and dizziness,” both of which are common symptoms of asthma attacks and do not align with the CDC’s warning signs of overdose.Both Stolbach and Humphreys expressed concern that fear of fentanyl exposure is increasing anxiety for police officers, whose job involves myriad dangers as it is. Humphreys said he would be willing to stand in front of cops and personally demonstrate the safety of touching fentanyl with his bare hand. Demonstrations and outreach, he said, could be one way to make the point. Stolbach said he met with officials from the San Diego Sheriff’s Department in the wake of August’s viral PSA (which has since been removed by Vimeo) and found them “receptive” to his feedback.Fighting the misconceptions around fentanyl exposure is easier said than done, given the saturation of the narrative within the law enforcement community, as well as in the news and on TV. Buckel’s lawyer, Coleen Dailey, said she tried to fight against Buckel’s assault charge in 2017, “but for every article that said that passive exposure did not cause an overdose, there was one that said it did.”Buckel, who remains in jail, said all he cares about now is “getting out and getting established,” reconnecting with his kids, and getting back to work. He will remain incarcerated for two more years, but he has advice for Starnes and others charged with endangerment or assault of an officer for fentanyl possession: “Fight the case,” he said.

201,"The US government claims that the price it got for the legendary sole copy of Wu-Tang Clan’s Once Upon a Time in Shaolin is a “trade secret” that cannot be revealed, according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News.","


The US government claims that the price it got for the legendary sole copy of Wu-Tang Clan’s Once Upon a Time in Shaolin is a “trade secret” that cannot be revealed, according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News.The album was originally purchased for about $2 million by pharmaceutical executive and hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli in 2015. When he was convicted of securities fraud in 2018 and ordered to forfeit $7.36 million, US marshals seized the album along with other assets. Advertisement     Last July, the Justice Department announced it had found a buyer for the album but didn’t identify the individual or the price. Attorney Peter Scoolidge told the New York Times that digital art collective PleasrDAO purchased the album from the US government for $4 million. The documents say that the new buyers assume the same terms of Shkreli’s purchase agreement. They may display the presentation box embedded with the Wu-Tang Clan logo, which was designed by British Moroccan artist Yahya Rouach, but they are prohibited from making copies of the album.
 


According to a copy of the five-page purchase agreement, the album was ""sealed with “tamper-proof evidence tape” and delivered to the new owners “in that state.”The new documents, which were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, include dozens of previously undisclosed photographs of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin. The album, conceived by the rap group as a work of art, is held in a nickel silver box stored in a cedarwood box and covered in black cow leather with light beige velvet lining. It also includes a 175-page leather-bound lyric book and a gold-leafed certificate of authenticity. The government redacted images of the two CDs, the song titles and the lyric book citing ""trade secrets.""Wu-Tang Clan said the choice to produce only one copy of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin was a form of protest of the way music had been devalued in the digital era.Neither Scoolidge nor representatives for Wu-Tang Clan responded to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News. On March 9 2018, after Shkreli was ordered to forfeit the album, Scoolidge sent a letter to the federal prosecutor on the case that said “any transfer of ‘Once Upon a Time in Shaolin’ by Mr. Shkreli to any third party is restricted substantially by the terms of the September 3, 2015 Purchase Agreement through which Mr. Shrkeli obtained the work.”At the time, Scoolidge represented Tarik “Cilvaringz” Azzougarh, a co-producer of the album who owned a 50 percent share of the master recordings. The letter said Azzourgarh was prepared to litigate to stop the forfeiture of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin because the transfer of the album to the US government violated the terms of the contract Shkreli entered into when he bought it. Azzourgarh's name was redacted from the letter but a source familiar with it confirmed it was him.“The United States and its agencies cannot take greater property rights from Mr. Shkreli than were granted by my client in the Purchase Agreement,” said the letter released by the Justice Department Wednesday. Azzourgarh ""is prepared to file a petition under the forfeiture order to protect his rights in the work. Please advise if you are open to potentially working out an agreement with my client and Mr. Shkreli that protects my client’s rights so that we can avoid the need to burden"" the federal judge that ordered the forfeiture. Advertisement     It appears Scoolidge and federal prosecutors were working on an agreement for more than a year. On Dec. 20, 2019, the associate general counsel in the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York sent Scoolidge a letter indicating the government was gearing up to sell Once Upon a Time in Shaolin and needed guidance on how to do that without violating the terms of Shkreli's original purchase agreement.RZA, the de facto leader of the rap group, told a New York radio station last year he regretted selling the album to Shkreli. But since the government’s sale to PleasrDAO, RZA said he believes the album is in better hands.

202,"At least 13 people, including seven children, died after a massive fire ripped through a Philadelphia apartment building, officials said.","


Twelve people — eight of whom were children — died Wednesday morning after a massive fire ripped through a Philadelphia apartment building, officials said.The duplex was owned by the federally funded Philadelphia Housing Authority, whose properties are home to about 80,000 low-income residents.At a news conference, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney called it ""without a doubt one of the most tragic days in our city's history.""""Losing so many kids is just devastating,"" he added. ""Keep these babies in your prayers.""There were 26 people living in the building, and the death toll was feared to rise due to the ongoing nature of recovery efforts, First Deputy Fire Commissioner Craig Murphy said. At least eight people escaped on their own, and two — one adult, and one child — were transported to the hospital. Advertisement     City officials said in a statement Wednesday night that one child who was rescued from the building later died.""It was terrible — I’ve been around for 35 years now, and this is probably one of the worst fires I’ve ever been to,"" Murphy said. ""We plan on making sure that this tremendous loss of life did not happen in vain.""Officials earlier on Wednesday, as recovery efforts at the scene were ongoing, had given a death toll of 13. They revised that number to 12 fatalities Wednesday night.There were at least four smoke detectors in the building, but they didn't go off during the fire, Murphy said. According to the Philadelphia Housing Authority, he added, four smoke detectors had been installed in 2019, and two more were installed in 2020.The agency's CEO, Kelvin A. Jeremiah, said in a statement that the building's two units ""were last inspected in April 2021 and May 2021 respectively,"" and that ""all smoke detectors were operating properly at that time.""“This unimaginable loss of life has shaken all of us at PHA,"" Jeremiah said. ""It is too early for us to say more.""The cause of the fire is under investigation, though it is ""not necessarily considered suspicious,"" Murphy said. Though he could not say whether the building was overcapacity, he said 26 residents is ""a tremendous amount of people to be living in a duplex.""Dinesh Indala, Philadelphia Housing Authority's Vice President of Operations, told CBS Philly they had not been aware how many residents were living there, saying the ""count for the number of people on that property is too high"" but adding that it could be due to ""people coming and visiting"" for the holidays.The mayor, meanwhile, urged the public not to ""make judgment on the number of people living in the house.""""Sometimes it’s better for people to be indoors than on the street,"" Kenney said. ""Maybe they were relatives or people that needed to be sheltered.""The names of those who died were not immediately released, but heartbroken neighbors said they remembered seeing some of the youngest victims playing outside over the years.“I knew some of those kids — I used to see them playing on the corner,” 34-year-old neighbor Dannie McGuire told the Associated Press. “And some of those kids have lived here as long as us.” Advertisement

203,Hundreds of Facebook moderators at the company's Mountain View campus can now work from home after their employer Accenture reversed an unpopular return-to-work mandate.,"


Hundreds of Facebook contractors who were ordered to return to the company’s Mountain View campus this month amid an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases were told today that they can continue working from home, an abrupt reversal of a company mandate.Following a BuzzFeed News inquiry, Accenture, a subcontractor that manages content moderation for Facebook, walked back its late December demand that moderators return to work in Mountain View on Jan. 24. The policy change was set against a backdrop of worker dissent as contractors openly questioned why they had to report to the office when full-time Facebook employees could defer their return by several months. Multiple moderators threatened to resign if health exemptions continued to be denied for vulnerable contractors. Advertisement     Contractors were told verbally on Wednesday morning that the return to work was being delayed.In response to a detailed list of questions, a spokesperson said that given current health data “we have let our team members working from home know they should continue to do so.”""We work collaboratively with our people on individual accommodations, including work from home, in compliance with all applicable employment laws and local regulations,"" the spokesperson added.
 


In a late December staff call, Accenture told a team of hundreds embedded at one of the social network’s California headquarters that they must return to the office on Jan. 24. Employees who subsequently requested special consideration for being immunocompromised or protecting vulnerable family members were not given exemptions. “Once the return to office is complete for Meta, there unfortunately will not be work that can be done from home on this project,” those who inquired were told in a boilerplate email. The announcement came just weeks after Facebook’s parent company, Meta, told full-time employees that they could defer their return to work for three to five months amid a flurry of similar actions by companies like Google and Apple.Accenture’s return-to-office mandate would have affected a building of roughly 400 people tasked with reviewing and flagging for removal the worst of what’s posted to Facebook. Some said the decision underscored the lesser treatment of Facebook contractors.“It’s unconscionable and I’m just sick of it,” one contractor told BuzzFeed News, speaking on the condition of anonymity as they are forbidden from speaking publicly about Facebook or Accenture matters.
 


In response to a series of detailed questions, a Meta spokesperson said the company will “continue to prioritize everyone's health and safety” as it works to get teams back into the office.Contractors claim quarters are too cramped to properly social distance. (Previously, moderators worked out of two buildings leased by Facebook, but as of last year were consolidated into a single facility.) One contractor told BuzzFeed News that Accenture’s COVID protocols require them to remain 3 feet apart at all times. “But that’s a lie because each desk is 1 foot apart,” they said. Workers are also concerned about using elevators, which are limited to four people at staggered intervals but are workers’ only mode of traveling between floors, as stairwells have been completely closed off. One contractor said the elevator limits are not really being enforced. Facebook and Accenture both declined to comment on these matters.Internal emails viewed by BuzzFeed News show that several Facebook contractors tested positive for COVID in December. As of Monday, the number of cases was reportedly as high as 34 people. Contractors said they only learned about the total number of cases by talking to their coworkers, as communications regarding infections are limited to affected floors. Facebook and Accenture declined to comment on the number of COVID cases among contract workers.Contractors told BuzzFeed News that COVID sick leave, which entailed two weeks of regular pay for employees who tested positive for the virus, stopped being offered in September. Facebook contractors in Mountain View also do not receive hazard pay, and in October 2020, hundreds of Facebook workers signed a petition demanding paid leave for moderators at the company’s Austin offices, Motherboard reported.Contractors who test positive for COVID or suspect they might have COVID ""are paired with a case worker to ensure that they have access to a comprehensive range of benefits and support, including paid time off, while they are recovering,"" an Accenture spokesperson said.But sources within the company told BuzzFeed News that connecting with COVID support services has been difficult at times, and that they do not wish to use PTO in lieu of designated sick leave. Contractors said an online portal for submitting accommodation requests is also not functional, and called Accenture's larger support system a ""broken cycle."" Accenture has not replied to a request for comment on these claims. Advertisement     ""There's no submit or continue button after putting in all the information,"" one worker said. ""Prior to putting any information in, though, it does mention talk to your supervisor. But the supervisor will tell you to email HR. But HR will send that link.""
 


On internal company message boards viewed by BuzzFeed News, Facebook employees and contractors criticized Accenture’s handling of COVID infections in its offices and lack of sick leave for moderators. Workers expressed confusion over how to alert the company should they test positive for COVID and objected to being told to use personal vacation hours to recover.The US set a global record on Monday with 1 million new COVID cases reported in a single day. In California, the state’s Department of Health reported more than 230,000 new COVID cases on Tuesday.Prior to Accenture’s policy change, nearly a dozen contractors publicly and privately expressed their intent to resign rather than return to work. Contractors told BuzzFeed News that Accenture and Facebook were unresponsive to their requests for personal exemptions.“Regular Facebook employees can go back at their leisure,” one contractor said. “Contractors, as always, know they’re treated as second-class citizens.”

204,"A smart satire or a self-indulgent lecture? Our roundtable discusses the divisive Netflix film, Don’t Look Up. (Spoilers ahead!)","


Tomi Obaro: On Christmas Eve, Netflix dropped Don’t Look Up, a star-studded satire about two scientists played by Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio who discover a comet hurtling toward a very indifferent Earth. Written and directed by Adam McKay (The Big Short), the film was one of Netflix’s most-watched movies ever. But reception has been mixed. Let’s discuss!First things first, who actually liked this movie?Jason Wells: Me.Scaachi Koul: I liked it, but I also had the benefit of zero expectation.Stephanie McNeal: I also liked it!Elamin Abdelmahmoud: I can’t relate to the “mixed” reception, because I had a good time. But because of how we talk on the internet, sometimes simply saying you liked something comes across as suggesting that this is, like, the top Oscar contender for the year. Don’t Look Up is… fine. It’s fine. I had a good time. Advertisement     OK, I guess I am alone in finding the film extremely unsubtle and an absolute slog to get through. For the folks who like the movie, why?JW: I did not come into this expecting whatever I think others were — give yourself over to the camp and enjoy the spectacle. Netflix clearly spent a shit ton on this thing and it showed, bad bangs and all.SK: I’m a big advocate for movies that press on the pleasure centers of our brains, even if those movies aren’t actually any “good.” Didn’t Don’t Look Up do its job? A weird Ariana Grande song, Jennifer Lawrence in a haircut that is a direct affront to God, forcing Leonardo DiCaprio to pretend he’s married to a woman his own age, Jonah Hill with a Birkin. Come on. Don’t be greedy. You can’t ask for more.SM: I thought it made the point it wanted to make and did so well. I also was fully entertained for the entire thing, which was super long. I just felt like it was a satire that worked for me, even though it made me kind of depressed because I think it hit too close to home.EA: Some folks don’t like to be lectured in their movies and television. Others are fans of Aaron Sorkin. I am the latter. I love a pedantic movie. This is Adam McKay’s third pedantic movie — The Big Short is basically a sentient angry Reddit post, and Vice is a sarcastic Wikipedia page, and god I love it. I love it! Sometimes, I want to watch things that not only confirm my worldview, but also actively kick other worldviews right in the gonads. But to give you perspective on the kind of person I am: I watched the entirety of Sorkin’s The Newsroom. Twice. I am sorry to say that I am the primary audience for Don’t Look Up.Some critics have expressed negative opinions about the film. In Manohla Dargis’s New York Times review, she notes that “McKay’s touch here is considerably blunter and less productive than it has been in a while” and even suggests that Meryl Streep’s character is kind of sexist. Alison Willmore (former BuzzFeeder!) writes in her Vulture review, “McKay’s movies are not particularly pointed in their satire and, as time has gone on, have increasingly settled into their preferred form of a harangue. He seems to believe that people need laughs and famous faces to be lured into thinking about more pressing matters, and he hates them for it.” Do you agree? Advertisement     JW: If you think it’s too on the nose, look in the mirror.SK: Isn’t that the point? I appreciated the raw nihilism of it; it’s not like the ending gives anyone much hope for the future, nor should it.EA: This movie would never work if the allegory was more subtle. What do you want, slowly rising sea levels and melting glaciers? To turn up the satirical absurdity, it needed to be directly on the nose. I mean, “Me and your father are for the jobs the comet will provide” — come on, that hits! You have a planet that’s warming at an alarming rate, and politicians asking how to create jobs fighting climate change?? The time for subtlety was, oh, maybe 20 years ago.SM: This seems overly nitpicking to me TBH.One incontestable fact is that the film is jam-packed with stars. Which cameo was your favorite?JW: It felt like everyone was a cameo in this, and I know Cate is getting a lot of ish, but when the comet is hitting and she said, “Honestly, I think I’d just rather drink and talk shit about people,” I saw myself.SK: Probably the little blip we got of Chris Evans, one of the top three Chrises for sure. I don’t think I even realized it was him until much, much later. I’m curious how you pay someone for a cameo that lasts, what, 20 seconds?EA: Gotta hand it to Kid Cudi! More Cudi in movies, please.SM: I think one of the reasons the movie worked is every person was very talented. I loved Jonah Hill and Meryl the most, probably.Which actor had the most impressive performance?JW: Every character was unlikeable, so kudos to them. But Meryl Streep took the cake. Thumbs up to her stylist.EA: Jonah Hill as the president’s son and chief of staff — extremely punchable behavior. I am never motivated to violence, so shouts to Jonah Hill for making me really hate his character.
 


For all the film’s star power, the wigs are horrendous. (Rob Morgan’s is a hate crime, as I have previously tweeted; Tyler Perry’s influence is undefeated!) Who had the worst wig?JW: Rob Morgan vs. Jennifer’s bangs.EA: I do not notice wigs, and even I shrieked at the Rob Morgan situation.SK: Pretty bummed about Meryl’s hair-in-a-can wig. Couldn’t someone have run a comb through it at least?SM: The Bezos/Musk tech guy character’s because he was so creepy.What was the most surprising thing about the film?JW: The total destruction of Earth??!! It was beautiful to behold.EA: I think beautiful is exactly the word here. That whole last sequence was so emotional and moving. Did I cry? Give me a raise and I’ll tell you.SK: Meryl’s lower back tat. Also, that she decided to do this movie in the first place. Good for her.JW: OMG yes. The lower back tat wins.SM: I personally didn’t see the “tech genius harvests the comet for money” thing coming, and it made me want to die.JW: Same. Although I didn’t see a lot of things coming in the movie, so by the time that happened I was just like, “OK.”Do we want more movies like this in 2022? Is the movie lecture having a moment?JW: It is, and I’m here for it.SK: I don’t know that it was really a lecture; to me, it felt more like a cry for help. A lecture suggests it would be more pointed, but instead it was just a reminder that everything is bad, all the time, on every planet, for the rest of time. But I’m not against more movies that just lean into despair — what are we doing, performing optimism? And for what????SM: Yes, because it was actually CREATIVE. It wasn’t a biopic or a remake or something. At least we can all say it wasn’t something that we had seen before.EA: For some of us, the movie lecture never went away. ●

207,"Every year, police officers claim to have suffered near-fatal overdoses after accidentally touching fentanyl. Experts say it’s medically implausible and the hype around this perceived threat is harming overdose victims, taxpayers, and first responders.","


Every year, police officers claim to have suffered near-fatal overdoses after accidentally touching fentanyl, a synthetic opioid more powerful than morphine or heroin.“Deputy Nearly Dies of Fentanyl Overdose,” read a headline from the Sacramento Bee this summer. “Officer Exposed to Fentanyl & Transported to Local Hospital,” stated a press release from the Santa Rosa Police Department in 2020. “Police Officer Overdoses After Brushing Fentanyl Powder Off His Uniform,” read the headline on a CNN story from 2017. Advertisement     But there’s something off about this seeming epidemic of accidental overdoses: It is virtually impossible to overdose simply by touching or getting too close to fentanyl. Doctors and toxicologists warn that the hype around this perceived threat is harming overdose victims, taxpayers, and first responders.Accidental overdose by skin exposure “is chemically and physically implausible,” said Dr. Ryan Marino, a medical toxicologist and addiction medicine specialist who serves as an assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.Dr. Andrew Stolbach, an emergency physician and medical toxicologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said, “It's not possible to overdose on fentanyl by touching it. If it was absorbed well through the skin, people wouldn’t inject it and snort it in order to get high.”Despite this, people who use the drug are facing serious legal repercussions — such as charges of assault or endangerment of officers — for supposedly causing these impossible overdoses.“People should not be in jail for imaginary crimes,” Marino said.
 


“Bad timing. Bad luck.”That’s how Justin Buckel describes what happened the night of May 12, 2017. He had just been released from jail on bond in East Liverpool, Ohio, when he was pulled over. The officer was quickly joined by Chris Green, a local police officer who was off duty but happened to be nearby.The officers searched Buckel’s car for drugs and found powder that later tested positive for fentanyl. Buckel said at the scene that the powder in the vehicle might include fentanyl. He was arrested. At least an hour later, Green complained to a colleague he didn’t feel well. He had brushed some powder off of his shirt, touching it with his bare skin. The colleague later recounted in police documents that Green “became saturated in sweat and was barely coherent.” Green told BuzzFeed News he remembers “panicking, trying to talk,” and falling forward, but nothing after that. He was taken to a hospital and treated for an overdose.Buckel pleaded guilty to charges including trafficking and possession and was sent to prison for six and a half years. In addition, he was charged with assault on a peace officer for “exposing” Green to fentanyl, which made up a year and a half of the jail time.When he was sentenced, the Ohio attorney general’s office put out a press release that led with the assault charge. Mike DeWine, who was attorney general at the time and is now governor, contributed a quote: ""Fentanyl is so dangerous that even the slightest exposure can be deadly, but thankfully in this case naloxone was close at hand.” (DeWine’s office told BuzzFeed News in a statement that Green’s overdose was a “documented, medical incident” and claimed it is “factually incorrect” that this overdose was medically implausible.) The news media picked the story up accordingly.
 


Buckel’s arrest was one of many similar stories that got national attention. The prevalence of these tales of accidental overdose has increased along with the amount of fentanyl in the illicit drug supply in the United States.A study published in the Harm Reduction Journal last year showed that stories of accidental fentanyl exposure made up over 150 media reports in 2017. Stolbach, the Johns Hopkins physician, was one of the authors of a 2020 Journal of Medical Toxicology study that traced the origin of the concern to a small number of reports from 2013, noting that such media reports increased in 2016, the same year the United States Drug Enforcement Agency itself issued a warning that “fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin or through accidental inhalation of airborne powder.”A DEA spokesperson confirmed the agency later took down an accompanying video warning of this supposed risk that was posted on YouTube and noted that the DEA follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for preventing occupational exposure to illicit drugs. More recent first responder guidance from the DEA says, “Incidental skin contact may occur during daily activities but is not expected to lead to harmful effects if the contaminated skin is promptly washed off with water.” Representatives for the agency did not respond to a request for comment on the 2016 warning.The Journal of Medical Toxicology study noted two distinct spikes in media reports about first responder opioid exposures in 2017. The bigger spike came in the second quarter of the year, the same time period Buckel was arrested.Green appeared on CBS News five days after Buckel’s arrest, when anchor Norah O’Donnell told viewers, “The opioid crisis is not only dangerous for those addicted to the drugs, but also for first responders.” An on-air graphic declared, “OVERDOSE BY ACCIDENT.” Representatives for CBS News did not respond to multiple requests for comment on whether medical experts were contacted for the story.A few months later, CBS’s fictional cop show Blue Bloods featured a harrowing plotline in which an officer was rushed to the hospital after touching a tray containing fentanyl. A suspect and doctor both proclaimed the officer had overdosed. Representatives for CBS did not respond in time for publication when asked whether toxicologists or other medical professionals were consulted about the episode. Over 8 million people watched it the night it premiered. Advertisement     Logically, the argument that passive fentanyl exposure poses an overdose risk to first responders falls apart with a little questioning. If it did, why don’t nurses who work with fentanyl in hospital settings experience similar symptoms? What about dealers, the loved ones of drug users, or volunteers at needle exchange sites?Experts have long warned that this pervasive concern can create serious consequences for drug users, first responders, and taxpayers. Marino said he has seen first responders hesitating to resuscitate patients experiencing fentanyl overdoses both in the hospital and in the field. The 2020 Harm Reduction Journal study pointed out that officers report entering the field with significant fear of fentanyl. A study published the previous year in Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness surveyed first responders in New York, finding that 80% of them believed “briefly touching fentanyl could be deadly.”
 


While many first responders clearly experience physical suffering after a believed exposure to fentanyl, experts suggest it’s possible they are experiencing panic attacks or “line-of-sight” afflictions, not overdoses, and are suffering negative consequences to their mental health. Some symptoms of opioid overdoses — such as perspiration and lightheadedness — are also associated with anxiety attacks.Ryan McNeil, an assistant professor of medicine and public health at Yale University, said first responder descriptions of suspected overdoses sound like panic attacks, not toxicity, and ""it's galling that we're treating that as an overdose when it's not even how an overdose presents."" Advertisement     In August, the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department came under fire for releasing a packaged PSA and insisting, even after an outcry from medical experts online, that it showed a deputy overdosing from passive fentanyl exposure.
 


The body camera footage is dramatic. Deputy David Faiivae falls to the ground after touching a powder, and one of his colleagues assures him, “I’m not going to let you die!” In the PSA, officers involved that day sit down for confessional-style interviews and Faiivae states, “I almost died.”What made this instance different from its predecessors was that doctors and experts organized to push back. Over 400 physicians, nurses, and public health researchers signed a letter demanding retractions from the major outlets that credulously repeated the department’s claim. They highlighted the 2017 findings of a joint American College of Medical Toxicology and American Academy of Clinical Toxicology task force, which found that “incidental dermal absorption is very unlikely to cause opioid toxicity,” and “toxicity cannot occur from simply being in proximity to the drug.”Under pressure, the department admitted the deputy never underwent a toxicology screening to determine if fentanyl was in his system, but they refused to disavow the video, even weeks later. A representative for the department confirmed to BuzzFeed News that Faiivae never underwent a toxicology screening and the organization has “not revisited this topic since that time.” They had no further comment. The story of the alleged overdose, dubious as it was, still spread. Green, who also says he is not sure he underwent a toxicology screening after his alleged overdose, posted an article about it to his own Facebook account.
 


Despite the very public myth-busting of fentanyl overdose from accidental contact with the drug, law enforcement officials across the country continue to go to great, very expensive lengths to avoid this “risk,” and people continue to face incarceration for supposedly causing these accidental overdoses.On Sept. 16, officials in Greene County, Tennessee, charged Tommy Starnes with two felony counts of reckless endangerment after a deputy and EMS worker both experienced “symptoms of an overdose” after treating him, according to a release from the Greene County Sheriff’s Department. Greene County Sheriff Wesley Holt would not share additional information with BuzzFeed News on what those symptoms entailed.Unlike Buckel, who was simultaneously hit with a variety of other trafficking-related charges, Starnes is not suspected of selling drugs. The first responders were called for an overdose. They were there to save Starnes’ life.Upon arriving at the scene after reports of the first responders’ symptoms, Holt donned a hazmat suit to retrieve evidence. The Tennessee Highway Patrol even flew in decontamination equipment by helicopter. Holt estimates the total cost of the response was around $3,800.Holt told BuzzFeed News it’s “a sad situation” that taxpayers foot those bills. When asked if he was aware of the research showing passive fentanyl exposure poses no significant risk to law enforcement officers (thus rendering the helicopter decontamination unnecessary), he said he was not. He dismissed the idea that the first responders experienced anxiety or a so-called nocebo effect — the opposite of a placebo effect, wherein a negative outcome arises from negative expectations — and declined to say whether the deputy or EMS worker who came in contact with Starnes were given toxicology screenings.Reporting by a local journalist later revealed that every officer in Greene County has been given a protective suit in the wake of Starnes’ arrest. Holt estimates that cost the department another $800. The reporting also said the ambulance used to transport Starnes was given “an intense cleaning” with chemicals flown in by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations. Representatives for the TBI did not say what that might have cost. Advertisement     Todd Estep, a public defender who represents Starnes, said he had not been aware of the body of research indicating that the endangerment his client was charged with is medically implausible until he was contacted by BuzzFeed News. Starnes, who also faces felony charges of possession, remains in jail awaiting an arraignment this month.
 


Green, like Holt, rejects the idea that any first responder’s reaction to the presence of fentanyl is brought on by anxiety or a nocebo effect. “I’m a pretty hardened guy,” he said. “Nothing really rattles me.” He is no longer with the ELPD. A review of internal documents showed he was terminated after a number of violations uncovered by an investigation ordered by East Liverpool Mayor Gregory Bricker, including dishonesty and discourteous treatment of the public. Green told BuzzFeed News he believes he was let go because he raised concerns about corruption in the department and is mounting a legal challenge to ensure “the facts will come out.”He has since found employment working in drug detection for a private company and told BuzzFeed News it is essentially the same job he had with the ELPD, but he makes “a ton more money.” Green is thrilled with his new gig, saying, “My passion is drugs. Like if I was allowed, I would literally be a cop for free if I could just hunt drugs and drug dealers all day.”He also dismissed doctors’ insistence that passive exposure cannot cause an overdose, saying, “I don't really care what the naysayers say or feel or whatever. I know what I experienced, and it's godawful.”It’s impossible to say for sure what is really going on in these instances, though Green and Holt both remain adamant that passive exposure is an overdose threat and the police are not lying or experiencing panic attacks. First responders, Green said, are either “really good actors and we have an elaborate hoax going on or the shit is real.” Advertisement     Stolbach, who helped author the 2017 position statement from the American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology task force, said that what happened in the San Diego Sheriff’s Department video showed “some sort of medical event, but not opioid-poisoning definitive.” He doesn’t know why the message that these types of overdoses are impossible isn’t taking hold in police departments, even years after the possibility of passive overdose was debunked.“Every police officer or police official that I personally come into contact with, they're on board with me and they understand, and yet, somehow, this message isn't penetrating the police,” he said, adding that between the medical and law enforcement communities, “there’s not a lot of interface.”Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University who is a former senior policy adviser to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, believes resistance to accurate information about the possibility of exposure overdoses isn’t just an issue among first responders. His concern lies with prosecutors.“It may not be an entirely rational process for them,” said Humphreys. “They could just be glad to have another way to charge people. Generally, as prosecutors, the more things you can charge somebody with, the more power you have, so even if they knew that this was mostly hysteria and hokum, they might still welcome the power. I don't know if you can change that.”Fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin, but only under unique circumstances. Fentanyl patches are used therapeutically by medical professionals all the time, which may have contributed to the belief that instantaneous absorption and subsequent overdose are possible.
 


“The fentanyl patch is not just fentanyl, so that is definitely completely different from what's on the streets. The patch is fentanyl combined with an alcohol or glycol product so that it becomes a solution and so those compounds do absorb through the skin,” said Marino, who explained that the 75-microgram patch does not contain “a big dose” and “takes 13 hours to get to just the therapeutic dose.” Overdosing, he said, would require “many, many hours of holding this patch against the skin.”Green told BuzzFeed News he used hand sanitizer before brushing the powder off of himself that day in 2017 and believes that could have facilitated some kind of absorption. Asked why he had a reaction but Buckel — who handled the powder too, which led to his conviction for tampering with evidence – didn’t, he said it was probably because Buckel used drugs and had a tolerance.Green also pointed out that another suspect arrested with Buckel was transported to the hospital before he was, though at the time, he questioned whether the suspect was trying to get out of jail. Green and the police report from the time both noted the suspect said he had asthma. Per the police report, the suspect experienced “shortness of breath and dizziness,” both of which are common symptoms of asthma attacks and do not align with the CDC’s warning signs of overdose.Both Stolbach and Humphreys expressed concern that fear of fentanyl exposure is increasing anxiety for police officers, whose job involves myriad dangers as it is. Humphreys said he would be willing to stand in front of cops and personally demonstrate the safety of touching fentanyl with his bare hand. Demonstrations and outreach, he said, could be one way to make the point. Stolbach said he met with officials from the San Diego Sheriff’s Department in the wake of August’s viral PSA (which has since been removed by Vimeo) and found them “receptive” to his feedback.Fighting the misconceptions around fentanyl exposure is easier said than done, given the saturation of the narrative within the law enforcement community, as well as in the news and on TV. Buckel’s lawyer, Coleen Dailey, said she tried to fight against Buckel’s assault charge in 2017, “but for every article that said that passive exposure did not cause an overdose, there was one that said it did.”Buckel, who remains in jail, said all he cares about now is “getting out and getting established,” reconnecting with his kids, and getting back to work. He will remain incarcerated for two more years, but he has advice for Starnes and others charged with endangerment or assault of an officer for fentanyl possession: “Fight the case,” he said.

208,These gorgeous photos of American diners encourage a closer look.,"


Leah Frances is a photographer behind a popular Instagram account, American Squares, and the author of a book with the same name. “I couldn’t believe that name wasn’t taken,” she told us from her home outside Easton, Pennsylvania. Frances got started on Tumblr in 2013, after seeing some photographs by Stephen Shore when she worked at the Wall Street Journal.“I was so blown away that I went out and bought a camera and flew out to LA and walked around taking pictures.” Advertisement  Her work focuses on the interiors of diners — the very American restaurants modeled after the café cars on trains and grew in popularity in the early half of the 20th century. “My photographs are mostly empty of people, yet pushed-back chairs or half-finished meals on tables show that life did occur here,” she said. “Pictured are scenes where things once happened, never happened, or might still happen. Yet I don’t want us to be buried in collective amnesia: Things were never ‘normal.’ For example, if a political figure, even if they’re wealthy, if they sit beside you at a diner and eat a $4.99 hamburger suddenly they’re authentic. They’re working class. But of course, we all know it’s more complicated than that.”
 


Frances said her interest in her subject matter comes from having grown up consuming a steady diet of mid-century American film, though she lived in Canada. “I was really curious about how those symbols I saw growing up were represented today,” she said. “Someone once told me that my work is like that of an anthropologist, finding things and symbols that are from that time and comparing them to how they feel today.”“I feel like if you don't know my work, it reads as nostalgia, which I'm kind of trying to get away from,” she said. “There's a whole other side of it.”The locations she chooses are particular. Left behind by declining economies, the diners also reference an idealized American mythology. “I do always frequent the places I photograph, which I think is important,” she said. “I like to sit and watch and spend time and spend money and experience the place while I'm taking these photographs.”We’re sharing her photos here as we start 2022, and how businesses and communities are faring in the neverending pandemic years.

209,A phone number featured in Netflix's Don't Look Up actually directs callers to a sex  hotline in real life.,"Viewers of Netflix's latest offering Don't Look Up got an interesting surprise recently when they realized a phone number used in the movie actually belonged to a sex hotline. The apocalypse movie, which follows the world's reaction to the news that a planet-ending comet is heading straight for Earth, has been the talk of social media since its release last month. The first focus was, of course, the ensemble cast, which is made up of A-list heavy hitters such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, Jonah Hill, Cate Blanchett, Timothée Chalamet, and Ariana Grande. Then it was the seemingly real-life parallels as scientists tried in vain to convince the world that the meteor was real and would have devastating global effects — something which appeared to reflect global warming. But the conversation surrounding the movie recently took a turn for the unexpected when viewers decided to call a phone number that's advertised in the movie. At one point during the movie, Leonardo DiCaprio's character, Dr. Randall Mindy, appears in a commercial for tech company BASH in order to put people's minds at ease about the comet. The commercial then shows a phone number, promising ""peace of mind"" if viewers should call. So, of course, some people watching at home thought they'd investigate... Upon finding out that it directed the caller to a sex hotline, one viewer tweeted: ""Kudos to you Don't Look Up to having the BASH hotline for their asteroid stress prevention hotline being linked to a Hot Singles in Your Area phone number."" It's not yet confirmed if use of the phone number was intentional. However, director Adam McKay recently revealed that he'd purposefully left a shot of the film's camera crew in the final edit after people assumed it was an error."
210,"""I won’t be shamed for it! I had a blast ... No apologies for my drinking on New Year’s Eve. None.""","It’s 2022, and Andy Cohen is not sorry for having fun! Andy — like many — rang in the new year with ~perhaps~ one too many drinks. And while a boozy New Year’s Eve might not seem far from the ordinary, it just so happened that Andy’s night was broadcast live to the nation. In the unlikely event that you missed it, the beloved host was the center of attention this weekend following several comments he made live on CNN during New Year’s Eve Live from Times Square. Andy and his cohost, Anderson Cooper, kicked off the night’s festivities with several shots of what appeared to be tequila, which — toward the latter half of the four-and-a-half-hour broadcast — escalated into chaos (or TV gold, whichever you prefer). As the alcohol seemingly got to work, Andy burst into several on-air rants, taking aim at a number of public figures ranging from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to showbiz pals like Ryan Seacrest. However, the night arguably peaked when he turned his attention to former NYC mayor Bill de Blasio. Despite Anderson’s failed attempts to defuse the situation, Andy declared live on-air that de Blasio was the “crappiest” mayor in NYC history, and went on to tell CNN viewers that “the only thing that Democrats and Republicans can agree on is what a horrible mayor he has been.” Inevitably, clips of the live moment wound up going viral. And while the drunken rant was largely well received by those who tuned in, not everyone was so impressed with Andy’s good-humored outburst. In fact, the backlash prompted a number of reports which falsely claimed that Andy had been fired by the network, with one article even quoting “TV insiders” who alleged that staff from CNN were “embarrassed and angry.” Although, these reports were swiftly debunked by a representative for CNN who informed BuzzFeed News that they are firmly standing by their host and are excited to welcome him back for next year’s installment. And now that the dust has finally settled, Andy is setting the record straight on exactly what went down behind the scenes. Speaking on The Howard Stern Show on Tuesday, the Bravo star hit back at the false reports that staff at CNN were left “angry” by his NYE antics. After Howard asked if he had seen the reports, Andy slammed the “unnamed sources” responsible for “making up” the claims and proceeded to shed some light on the situation. “Listen, I will not be shamed for having fun on New Year’s Eve. That’s why I’m there. That’s why they bring me there,” he began. Offering a little more clarity, Andy highlighted that the viral clips that attracted the most backlash — namely, his de Blasio rant — were taken from the final portion of the broadcast. “It’s a four-and-a-half-hour show,” he said. “The booze started kicking in at around 11:30, so everyone is focusing on kind of the last 45 minutes or hour that we were on the air.” “I kicked into high gear with 45 minutes left, so we had done 15 interviews before that point, you know,” he added. Taking a stand against the criticism, Andy made it clear once again that he doesn't feel bad for ringing in the new year with a bit of laughter. “I won’t be shamed for it! I had a blast! Anderson had a blast! We left and we were like, ‘That was fun, what a fun New Year’s Eve,’” the host explained. “No apologies for my drinking on New Year’s Eve. None.” The TV star was subsequently asked to shed light on how his performance really went down with CNN execs. In response, he revealed the single piece of advice he was offered by the president of CNN, Jeff Zucker. “The only direction that I get every year from Jeff Zucker is: ‘Have fun,’” Andy said. “There you go. That is my job.” And, according to Andy, providing CNN viewers with some festive joy was his top priority — this year, more than ever. “It was not only a middling year,” he explained. “It ended in a car crash of COVID and Betty White dying on the day of New Year’s Eve, who everyone loved. So it was like, we’ve gotta kick it into gear. We’ve gotta have fun. A lot of people are at home spending their evenings with us.” But, while he may not be sorry, many of us know that a drunken night doesn't often go without consequences the next day. And so — like many others — Andy had a couple of regrets on Jan. 1. Speaking on his own SiriusXM radio show on Monday, the Watch What Happens Live host revealed that his “only regret” was making fun of Ryan Seacrest. Discussing the dig once again with Howard Stern on Tuesday, Andy revealed that he dropped the showbiz mogul a text the next day to apologize for throwing him “under the bus” on air. “I did wind up kind of starting to throw ABC under the bus, and that is my only regret from the night,” he said. ""Because I really like Ryan Seacrest. He’s a really nice guy."" He admitted: “I was kind of enjoying the rant! I was like, ‘It’s really fun being on CNN and just ranting like a nutty guy! This is fun!’ So I kept going, and that I felt bad about. And I texted Ryan the next morning.” Well, it seems that all’s well that ends well. And if Andy’s setting the tone for 2022, I think we can expect a lot of fun."
211,"Probation? A $5,000 fine? A month or two in prison?","


Join HuffPost and BuzzFeed News for a Twitter Spaces conversation about how the Capitol riot is still altering US politics on Jan. 4 at 1 p.m. ET. Sign up to be notified when the Space begins here.
 


WASHINGTON — What is the punishment for someone who admits they joined in on an attack on democracy?For Jordan Stotts of Minnesota, it was two years on probation, with two months of tighter limits on when he can leave home. He scaled a wall to join the breach of the US Capitol, was captured on camera shouting at officers in the rotunda, and vowed to return, posting on Facebook: “Patriots! I got kicked out but I’ll be back!”For Lori and Thomas Vinson of Kentucky, it was five years on probation plus a $5,000 fine. Prosecutors had wanted jail time for Lori — she told an interviewer after she was fired from her job for participating in the riot, “I would do it again tomorrow” — but a judge didn’t agree.For Boyd Camper of Montana, it was two months in jail. As he joined the mob streaming into the building, he filmed his trek on a GoPro. He told a news crew outside later, “We’re going to take this damn place.”The task of fashioning justice for people who admitted to participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection has fallen to 22 judges on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The court’s members — a mix of Democrat and Republican appointees — have made clear they believe the assault on the Capitol was serious and violent, and that people convicted of crimes deserve punishment. They just don’t agree on what it should be. Advertisement  Some judges have bristled that prosecutors struck plea deals for low-level misdemeanors that limit the sentences they can impose. Some have imposed sentences that were harsher than the government’s recommendation; others have been more lenient. Some have questioned the varying sentences proposed by prosecutors across a spectrum of Capitol rioters who pleaded guilty to the same offense.It is “no wonder,” US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell said at an October sentencing, that some people “are confused about whether what happened on Jan. 6 was a petty offense of trespassing or shocking criminal conduct that represented a grave threat to our democratic norms.”Judges have had no patience for Donald Trump supporters trying to use the courthouse as a forum to relitigate President Joe Biden’s win in 2020. But the lack of consensus on the bench about what exactly justice should look like for each person who joined the mob mirrors a lack of consensus nationwide about how to think about the insurrection and its aftermath.The most common sentence has been probation, with a short period of home confinement or a fine mixed in, according to BuzzFeed News’ tracking of every prosecution filed in the year since the Jan. 6 attack. Probation means people can mostly return to their normal lives, with conditions — they have to regularly report to a probation officer, get permission to travel, submit to a home inspection at any time, and hold a job. They can’t have guns or other weapons. Violating probation by committing new crimes or failing to comply with other terms is a standalone crime that can be prosecuted. Advertisement  Nearly all of the 71 defendants sentenced as of the end of December pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, with most deals featuring the same charge: illegally parading in the Capitol, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $5,000 fine.In more than half of these misdemeanor sentencings, judges ordered punishments that were lighter than what the government argued for in terms of jail or home detention. Two-thirds of defendants sentenced for misdemeanor pleas didn’t receive any jail time.If you have more information about Jan. 6 or the legal fights in its aftermath, contact this reporter at zoe.tillman@buzzfeed.com, or see other ways to send tips here.Prosecutors have not charged everyone accused of descending on the Capitol with felonies that reflect the political nature of the overarching criminal event, which temporarily halted Congress’ certification of the election and the peaceful transfer of power. No one has been charged with sedition or insurrection, both rarely brought offenses. A top Justice Department official said early on that sedition was being explored for “the most heinous acts,” along with conspiracy; more than 50 people have been charged with that latter crime.Of the 700-plus people charged so far, BuzzFeed News’ analysis shows that just over half are facing at least one felony. The most common felony count is for obstructing an official proceeding; those cases have tended to involve some specific evidence that defendants were actively trying to disrupt the special session of Congress, such as making it to the floor of the Senate or expressing their intent in interviews or online. The obstruction offense has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, although nonviolent, first-time offenders are likely to face far less than that, and prosecutors have already agreed to let some defendants plead down to a misdemeanor. There are also felony cases pending against people charged with assaulting police, carrying or using weapons, and civil disorder. Advertisement  Everyone else is being hit solely with misdemeanor charges for illegally being in the Capitol, disorderly conduct, and parading, a collection of counts carrying maximum penalties between six months to a year in jail. The US attorney’s office in Washington focused plea offers this year on the less serious cases with lower stakes. It’s a strategy that not only clears cases and frees up resources, but also is in keeping with broader trends across the US justice system, where the overwhelming majority of criminal cases end in plea bargains.This process means that justice for an attack on democracy is filtering through a criminal justice system largely built around agreements that are hammered out in secret between the accused (the rioters) and the accusers (the prosecutors), and sentences crafted by a single judge. The riot was the violent culmination of a monthslong effort led by Trump and his supporters to undo millions of votes cast in a presidential election, but there’s little to no opportunity for public input on the consequences for people who participated.
 


Judges have talked from the bench about the challenge of applying the normal rules to an unprecedented event like Jan. 6. They’ve explained that they have to treat each defendant as an individual and can’t punish them for the full spectrum of criminal activity committed at the Capitol.With most defendants admitting to the same misdemeanors on paper, judges are picking apart the details of their words and actions as compared to other rioters. They’re weighing how those details make a person more or less individually responsible for the threat — potential or actualized — posed by the mob.How many minutes did a defendant spend in the Capitol? Did they walk through a breached door or climb through a broken window? Where did they go? How far inside did they travel? Did they capture photos or video? Did they take selfies, and did they look happy to be there? Did they witness violence or vandalism and keep going? Did they publicly brag about it online, or only send messages to friends and family, and does that distinction matter? Is the remorse they expressed later legitimate or are they just sorry they got caught, and, really, how can anyone know for sure?And the big question that’s loomed over the conclusion of each of these cases: Is there any sentence that could dissuade people from storming the Capitol in January 2025 if they disagree with the results of the next presidential election? Advertisement  For some judges, the obvious answer is jail. In the handful of cases where a defendant has pleaded guilty to a felony like assaulting police or obstructing Congress, judges have imposed months or years of prison. The length of incarceration in misdemeanor cases may be short by comparison, but judges have said they hope the threat of any loss of liberty scares off other people, disappointed or furious when the candidate they supported loses an election, from taking matters into their own hands.US District Judge Tanya Chutkan has emerged as an early proponent of time behind bars for misdemeanor offenders. At a sentencing in early October, she ordered Matthew Mazzocco of Texas to spend 45 days in jail, becoming the first judge to go above the amount of time the government recommended. She chastised Mazzocco for treating the riot like “entertainment” — he’d posted a celebratory selfie in front of the Capitol on Facebook with the caption, “The capital is ours!” and took photos of himself smiling inside and outside the building — and said a harsher sentence was needed as a warning to others.“There have to be consequences for participating in an attempted violent overthrow of the government, beyond sitting at home,” Chutkan said at the time. Advertisement  Other judges aren’t convinced that time behind bars is justified for people pleading guilty to low-level, nonviolent crimes, or if a relatively short stint in jail is even the most effective way to make the punishment “hurt,” in the words of one judge. They’ve crafted sentences featuring combinations of probation, fines, home detention, computer monitoring, social media restrictions, mental health treatment, job training, and community service.With new cases being filed every week, 71 sentences is too small a number to confirm patterns for how the rest of these cases will play out. There’s too little data, for instance, to say whether the political pathways that judges took to the bench manifest in the sentences they hand down. Judges nominated by presidents of both parties, including Trump, have mixed records of ordering jail versus probation for Capitol rioters. But most judges have only presided over a handful of sentencings, and some judges haven’t sentenced anyone yet.Still, enough cases have reached the final phase to understand what judges are thinking about as they mete out justice. They’re aware of the intense media coverage of these cases and the fact that the court allows the public to dial in to hear live audio of most hearings, a pandemic-related expansion of access. They’re keeping an eye on the investigation into Jan. 6 that’s unfolding in Congress, and they’re paying close attention to what their colleagues are doing — sometimes publicly signaling when they agree or disagree with another judge’s decision or comments.There was the case where US District Judge Trevor McFadden accused the Justice Department of not being “even-handed” in its response to Jan. 6 compared to the protests last summer against racism and police brutality — comments that prompted Chutkan in another case to say she disagreed with McFadden, calling it a “false equivalence.” It was one of the few times where the broader political discourse seemed to seep into public exchanges among judges; McFadden was nominated by Trump, Chutkan by former president Barack Obama. There was the case where US District Judge Rudolph Contreras accused prosecutors of ramping up their sentencing recommendations because they were yelled at by another judge. Advertisement  Several judges have expressed concern about the case of Anna Morgan-Lloyd, who made an emotional plea for leniency to US District Judge Royce Lamberth and received probation. Morgan-Lloyd then went on Fox News the day after her sentencing and made comments that seemed to minimize the violence at the Capitol. Morgan-Lloyd’s lawyer has insisted her client got “played” by Fox and was honest with Lamberth, but judges have held up her case as a cautionary tale against giving too much weight to after-the-fact expressions of remorse.Lamberth, meanwhile, has made it known that he felt burned by Morgan-Lloyd. When Frank Scavo of Pennsylvania came before the judge last month after pleading guilty to the same parading misdemeanor, Lamberth blew past the two-week jail sentence that the government argued for, sentencing Scavo to 60 days.A few judges have complained that charging decisions by prosecutors tied their hands in crafting sentences.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson has questioned prosecutors about the wisdom of entering plea deals for a misdemeanor that restricted the options that judges had for ordering extended court supervision. US District Judge Carl Nichols expressed the same concern at a November sentencing for David Mish of Wisconsin, saying he was “very torn” because he thought Mish could benefit from longer-term contact with the court. Nichols ended up sending Mish to jail for 30 days, citing his previous criminal record as well as the need to deter others. Advertisement  
 


It’s not the first time that federal judges in Washington have been faced with novel questions of law with massive implications for the legitimacy of the US government and its institutions. The court has presided over legal entanglements from some of the biggest political scandals in modern history — Watergate, Whitewater and the Clinton affair, the Russia probe — as well as the crush of cases filed by people captured in the War on Terror after 9/11 challenging their indefinite detention at the US military installation in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.The sheer number of Jan. 6 cases sets this prosecution effort apart. A prosecutor recently said in court that the government believed that 2,000 to 2,500 people illegally went inside the Capitol, far more than the estimate of 800 people that a US Capitol Police official gave Congress early on. Prosecutors and Justice Department officials haven’t said if there’s a target number for when they’ll end the investigation. Advertisement  The seven people sentenced for felonies have all received prison time. Paul Hodgkins of Florida, who pleaded guilty to obstructing Congress, had tried to argue for no time behind bars since he hadn’t engaged in violence or destruction; he went onto the Senate floor and carried a “TRUMP” flag. US District Judge Randolph Moss said probation wasn’t an option and ordered him to spend eight months in prison, less than the 18 months sought by prosecutors. It was a benchmark-setting hearing that spelled bad news for any defendant hoping to stay out of prison with a felony plea deal.People needed to know that assaulting the Capitol and interfering with the democratic process “will have severe consequences,” the judge said at the time.Of the 64 people sentenced for a misdemeanor offense, 36 — more than half — received sentences that were lighter than what the government recommended as far as loss of liberty, according to BuzzFeed News’ analysis. That included 14 cases where judges rejected the government’s recommendation of prison time altogether, nine cases where judges ordered a period of incarceration that was shorter than the government’s request, and 13 cases where judges didn’t agree with the government’s recommendation of a short period of home confinement as a condition of probation.
 


Forty defendants who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors — roughly two-thirds — avoided time behind bars, receiving home confinement and probation, or probation alone.The remaining 24 misdemeanor offenders were incarcerated. Nine people received prison sentences that were more severe than what the government requested, with judges either going above the amount of incarceration prosecutors asked for or rejecting a recommendation of probation. Nine people received prison sentences that fell below the government’s recommendation, and six received time behind bars that matched the government’s request.Jail sentences for misdemeanor offenders have ranged from as short as 14 days to as long as six months, although in the two cases to hit that high end the defendants already had been in jail after their arrests and were sentenced to the time they’d served.US District Judge Thomas Hogan ordered Robert Reeder to spend three months in jail, less than the six months prosecutors argued for after new evidence emerged that he’d been involved in a physical confrontation with police. Hogan said he wanted his sentence to signal that other rioters should expect jail time. But he explained that he didn’t think six months was appropriate because Reeder didn’t have a previous criminal record and the judge wasn’t sold that the evidence showed Reeder deliberately struck an officer with his fist. Advertisement     The person-specific facts of each case make it hard to do apples-to-apples comparisons, but some cases feature similar overarching narratives. Russell Peterson of Pennsylvania livestreamed on Facebook — “The Capitol is ours right now,” he said at one point — and prosecutors accused him of downplaying the violence afterward. The government asked for two weeks in jail. Jackson sentenced him to 30 days. Prosecutors wanted 60 days in jail for Glenn Croy of Colorado, arguing he’d entered the Capitol twice, treated the breach like a “vacation” by taking and posing for photos, and sent messages after that disputed the level of violence. Howell sentenced him to three months of home confinement and three years of probation.Howell has used some of the strongest language this year denouncing the insurrection and questioning prosecutors’ decision not to press more serious charges against participants. But in several misdemeanor cases, she’s rejected the government’s jail recommendations, pointing to other cases where prosecutors asked for probation for rioters who pleaded guilty to the same crimes and saying she also had an obligation to avoid “unwarranted” differences. She blasted the government’s “muddled” approach and blamed prosecutors for undercutting their own efforts.Howell’s sentences have included a period of home confinement and probation for Jack Griffith, a Tennessee man who was recorded on video screaming in excitement as he entered the Capitol and whose extensive social media posts afterward suggested a lack of remorse. Prosecutors had asked for three months of incarceration. As part of his sentence, Howell ordered the probation office to monitor his computer activity and barred him from using any social media platforms without getting permission first. Advertisement     Some judges have turned to hitting people’s pockets. In 16 cases, judges ordered defendants to pay fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 as an additional penalty beyond probation or jail; in 13 of those cases, the sentences were otherwise lighter than the government’s recommendation.Fines levied by judges are on top of agreements defendants have made to pay restitution to the US government as part of their plea deals — $500 for a misdemeanor plea, and $1,000 to $2,000 for a felony plea. Between fines ordered by judges and restitution agreements, the 160-plus rioters who have entered guilty pleas owe $148,500, roughly 10% of the nearly $1.5 million that the government has estimated in damage to the Capitol.
 


When US District Judge Reggie Walton sentenced the Vinsons, overruling the government’s request for jail time for Lori Vinson, he explained that one reason for that was he didn’t think the cost of incarcerating her was worth it. He said that he’d rather have the couple contribute toward the cost of repairing the Capitol and jail would only delay their ability to do that. Advertisement     “​​I want the sentence to hurt, because people have to understand that if you do something like this, it’s going to hurt,” Walton said, ordering them each to pay $5,000.Walton took the same approach this month in sentencing Anthony Mariotto of Florida. The prosecutor asked for four months of incarceration, arguing his misdemeanor case was more serious because of how far he’d made it into the building — he posted a selfie on Facebook from the Senate gallery, smiling, with a caption that included, “This is our house” — and the fact that he recorded assaults on police, knocked on doors, and seemed to minimize his role in an interview later.Walton sentenced Mariotto to pay a $5,000 fine and spend three years on probation. The judge said he believed that participating in the insurrection was a serious enough offense to merit incarceration. But he said he also didn’t think it was realistic to try to jail every defendant, and that it wouldn’t be appropriate since other defendants who pleaded guilty to the same crime received probation.Some judges have used the public platform they have at these sentencing hearings to make their feelings about what happened on Jan. 6 known. They’ve emphasized the seriousness of the insurrection, disputed narratives that have sprung up among right-wing politicians and pundits that rioters were “tourists” or that incarcerated defendants are “political prisoners,” and called out some of the bold-face names who haven’t been criminally charged — Trump and his allies who promoted the lie that the 2020 election was stolen (and continue to do so). Advertisement     When US District Judge Rudolph Contreras earlier this month rejected the government’s request for jail time for Felipe Marquez of Florida, the judge explained that he believed Marquez would be better served by home confinement and probation, plus a set of additional conditions including mental health treatment, job training, and other support. The judge said that Jan. 6 was the result of an “unprecedented” series of events, spurred on by Trump and his allies who “bear much responsibility” for what happened.At a sentencing in November, US District Judge Amit Mehta said that defendant John Lolos of Washington state was “a pawn in a game that’s played and directed by people who should know better.” Prosecutors wanted 30 days in jail for Lolos, who entered the Capitol through a broken window, chanted in support of the mob as he walked through the building, and yelled, “They left! We did it!” as he left. He came to law enforcement’s attention when he was kicked off a plane after the riot for being disruptive and chanting, “Trump 2020!” Mehta sentenced him to 14 days.“People like Mr. Lolos were told lies and falsehoods and told that an election was stolen when it clearly was not,” Mehta said. “Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos for whatever reason are impressionable and will believe such falsehoods and such lies ... and they are the ones who are suffering the consequences.” Advertisement     No judge has found that individual rioters weren’t culpable because they were corrupted by online conspiracy theories or inspired by Trump.“No one was swept away to the Capitol,” Jackson said at Russell Peterson’s sentencing this month. “No one was carried. The rioters were adults. And this defendant, like hundreds of others, walked there on his own two feet and he bears responsibility for his own actions. There may be others who bear greater responsibility and who also must be held accountable, but this is not their day in court, it is yours.” ●

214,"Meet Peniel Enchill, the graphic artist behind the iconic “Woman Stepping Into the New Year” artwork","


With just a matter of days until the new year, if you exist in certain pockets of Twitter, you’ve likely seen an illustration of a Black woman stepping from one year into the next wearing high heels with a bag in hand.The illustration, created by British Ghanaian graphic artist Peniel Enchill, first appeared on the internet in 2014 and routinely goes viral each year. It has also become synonymous on Black Twitter with the saying “New year, new me.” Advertisement     In 2021, it went viral again in the middle of the year during the milk crate challenge when people thought a Black woman who completed the challenge in heels resembled the artwork.“I did that artwork in hours. It usually takes me a while to finish up an illustration. But I had what I like to call these days a ‘download,’ where you literally see the picture in your mind and it's just a matter of transferring that image from your mind to the paper. I rarely get that, but that was one of them,” Enchill told BuzzFeed News.The 29-year-old, who is based in Sheffield, England, recalled posting her artwork to her Instagram at a time that preceded the platform’s stories feature.“I remember logging back into Instagram and on my main feed, not on my profile, but on my main feed, I just kept swiping and seeing the image that I've drawn,” she said. “So these were actual reposts from people that I follow.” Advertisement     
 


The image was shared by larger platforms, including the Shade Room, and within hours, it was everywhere. Overnight, her audience on Instagram grew by 40,000. But as the popularity and reach of her artwork expanded, so did opinions, which were followed up with memes, reedits, and misogynistic trolling.“All I could see was the negative. Yes, there was positive feedback, but it was clouded by a lot of negative, and I took it quite personally,” she said.It took a word of advice from Enchill’s younger brother for her to see past the small pockets of negativity as her platform exploded, bringing new eyes to her entire portfolio.“My brother, being my brother, was like, 'Why are you upset? Have you seen how many followers you've got? Have you seen how many people have seen it? It's all over Twitter,’” she said. “I think it took me a whole day or two to start seeing the positive sides.”
 


Today, Enchill has over 270,000 followers on Instagram and can consistently chart a surge of growth around this time of year.Enchill said she is a big believer in how transformative a new year can be, and continues to create special illustrations to mark the end of one year and the start of another.Reflecting on her 2014 piece, she said that she was looking for a way to communicate that going into the new year is like stepping into a better year.“I think I'm still like that,” she said. “I still enter the year exactly like the girl that I drew. Reflecting on the year before, thinking about what I'm trying to achieve in the new year.”She said it’s still slightly hard to see her art used in a way that she wouldn't have approved of if she had been asked. Many of the memes of the woman were misogynistic and edited her going back to bad situations concerning relationships with men.She also said she has been approached about turning her artwork into NFTs (nonfungible tokens), but she is struggling to understand the benefit of it. “I don't think I've come to a comfortable place with that yet,” she said. “I might just have to do one to see how I feel about it all, but I'm not 100% sold on the idea yet.”
 


Black women are always central in Enchill’s art, often depicting them in storylines that deal with pushing back against cultural norms and unrealistic expectations demanded of them.“My focus is particularly on the Black community, with an extra focus of Black women and uplifting, inspiring, creating art for us, by us — speaking about issues that are not really spoken about, and celebrating things that affect us directly,” she said.She also owns a stationery brand that features her art, and hopes to one day see it stocked at major retailers.This year’s artwork is still in progress, she added, but the inspiration behind it is the well-known phrase “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.” But that, of course, hasn’t stopped people from making their own.

215,Meet SilentSpeller: A smart retainer from one of the creators of Google Glass that could let you text with your tongue.,"


A project led by one of the key creators of Google Glass, the tech giant’s influential but ultimately ill-fated smart eyewear, aims to let people have conversations without talking or using their hands to type, sign, or gesture.Called SilentSpeller, the project is a communication system that allows people to send texts using a high-tech dental retainer to spell out words without actually voicing them, according to a demo video and academic paper reviewed by BuzzFeed News. The device works by tracking the movement of the user’s tongue. Researchers claim the system identifies letters with 97% accuracy, and 93% accuracy for entire words. Advertisement     The research is the brainchild of Thad Starner, a pioneer in wearable technology. Starner played a lead technical role in developing Google Glass, the much-hyped device that helped introduce the world to a new genre of gadgets beyond smartphones. But the device courted controversy and pushed the bounds of society’s relationship with technology when Google introduced it almost a decade ago. SilentSpeller, by contrast, is a research project out of the Georgia Institute of Technology, where Starner is a professor, so the goal for now is more academic than product road map.However, the device could eventually be used to help people with movement disorders including Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor, Starner told BuzzFeed News in an interview. He also sees potential consumer applications, like hands-free communication in really quiet places, like a library, or really loud places where people would have to strain their voices to be heard.To develop SilentSpeller, researchers didn’t create a whole new retainer from scratch. Instead, they jury-rigged an existing product called SmartPalate, which looks like the kind of retainer used by orthodontists but is loaded with tiny sensors to track tongue movement for speech therapy. Software creates a visual map of how someone’s tongue functions while speaking, but while SmartPalate’s primary use is to help people correct speech disorders, researchers working on SilentSpeller adapted the system to transform the retainer into a communications tool.
 


The device reads tongue movements through the retainer’s 124 sensors, according to the academic paper. The data is then sent to a personal computer or smartphone through a USB wire. For now that means that users of the prototype will have a wire dangling from their mouths, but researchers believe they could eventually create a wireless version that fits entirely in the mouth. The device requires a dental impression for a custom-fitting retainer. Although researchers have been working on the project since January 2020, progress has been slowed because the COVID-19 pandemic has limited the number of participants that could get fitted for custom retainers.The effort is not a Google project, but it has the fingerprints of the company’s researchers on it. Starner is still a part-time research scientist at Google focusing on machine learning. Another author on the academic paper is Alex Olwal, a senior Google research scientist that leads the company’s Interaction Lab, an initiative aimed at intertwining digital and physical experiences. Olwal is also a technical lead for Google’s augmented reality division.The demo video for the project, published on Olwal’s YouTube channel, features Olwal testing out the device. His eyes are blurred out, but a Google spokesperson confirmed it’s him.
 


Google Research, an arm of the company that focuses on pure science and technological breakthroughs, is credited as a collaborator in the demo video, but the company spokesperson, as well as Starner, said the effort was not considered a Google Research project. Advertisement     The lead researcher of the project, Naoki Kimura, is a graduate student from the University of Tokyo and an exchange student studying under Starner at Georgia Tech, Starner said. Other researchers on the project come from universities including Carnegie Mellon and the University of Washington. The project was presented in May at the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, which normally takes place in Yokohama, Japan, but was held virtually amid the pandemic. The project, however, hasn't been widely known.Devices worn on — or in this case inside — the body have become a bigger focus of research over the last several years as tech becomes infused in more aspects of people’s lives. An Apple Watch can take an electrocardiogram with sensors that track your heartbeat. Facebook’s parent company Meta makes virtual reality headsets for tapping into the so-called metaverse, which tech executives describe as an immersive world with a mix of both digital and physical elements. For years, Facebook was also developing a “brain-computer interface” with the goal of allowing people to communicate by imagining the words they wanted to type, but the company pulled the plug on that project in July. Google has created internet-connected jackets and bags, and for a time the company experimented with smart contact lenses with glucose readers for people with diabetes.But as people start to use more of these devices, privacy concerns have cropped up. A device that fits into a person’s mouth could open the door to invasive types of data collection, said John Davisson, senior counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC, a Washington, DC–based nonprofit. A nightmare scenario, he said, might be a company gathering information about a person’s saliva or dental records. While that’s a long-term concern for a new generation of devices that deal with biometric data, there’s no indication SilentSpeller would have the capability to do anything like that.“It’s sort of obvious, the sensitivity of a device that goes inside of your head,” Davisson said. “That’s going to present some privacy risks.” He added there would need to be strict safeguards on what information it could collect. Advertisement     In the academic paper for SilentSpeller, researchers list a handful of use cases. In addition to helping people with limited dexterity and other consumers, there might even be applications on the battlefield. One use case, according to the paper, is “United Nations operations where silent communication is key.” The corresponding drawing is of two heavily armored soldiers holding assault rifles. In speech bubbles, the soldiers discuss tactical strategy, presumably through SilentSpeller.This isn’t the first time Google scientists have worked with university researchers. Google has long had a tight-knit relationship with academia, stemming from the company's start as a Stanford University project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, then graduate students. For 15 years, the company awarded financial grants to academic researchers called the Google Faculty Research Awards. In 2020, the company discontinued that program and said it would instead focus on supporting up-and-coming researchers and faculty working on projects that serve underrepresented communities. That year, CNET reported on several projects funded by Google Research or developed by the Interaction Lab. They included temporary tattoos that transform a person’s body into a living touchpad when applied to the skin and sunglasses that project holographic icons.

216,Huge decisions will be made in the next few years about who gets water from the shrinking Colorado River. Basin tribes are fighting to get their share.,"



 


This is Part 3 in a Colorado River Series. For Part 2, click here.On a 120-degree day, as waves of hot air shimmer above deeply cracked earth, it is difficult to imagine that a hundred years ago this land was part of a vast 2-million-acre expanse of blue waters and verdant trees that formed the delta of the Colorado River. Once robust enough for steamships to cross, the delta supported a thriving ecosystem with thousands of migratory birds and wetland species. Now, a bleached skeleton of a crab is one of the few signs of life remaining.The delta’s disappearance was the first indication that modern management of the river was pushing the system past its capacity. Starting in the 1930s, construction of major dams and diversions redirected water from the river to reservoirs, farms, and cities from Denver to Los Angeles. By 1960, water stopped regularly flowing to the delta, and over time, 90% of its 2 million acre expanse withered.“The river is so altered and contained now, I call it a big canal,” said Nora McDowell, who served as chair of the Fort Mojave Tribe for 25 years and actively leads efforts to protect the Colorado River. “This isn’t the river we knew. It used to be just wild. Where I swam, the water was blue and it was clean. It was our playground. … I remember it as a great blue lagoon.”The Colorado River is now at a tipping point, with implications stretching far beyond its delta. Water levels at the Lake Mead and Lake Powell reservoirs, which depend on snowmelt to feed the river, reached historic lows this year. For over two decades, Western states sharing the river have relied on water from these reservoirs to insulate their residents from feeling the impacts of a relentless 22-year megadrought.
 


But in August, water levels in the reservoirs dropped low enough to trigger the first-ever federal shortage declaration, which will cut states’ 2022 river usage by billions of gallons. More cuts are likely: 2021 was the second-driest water year on record, and a growing body of data indicates what we are seeing is not a temporary drought, but a permanently hotter, more arid environment and a significantly smaller Colorado River.Successfully managing water shortages in the short term, while developing solutions for the management of the Colorado River in the long term, is imperative for the 40 million people who depend on its waters. Ultimately, the crisis on the Colorado River is a story about how the United States chooses to adapt to climate change.Current projections indicating another dry year are “a stark reminder that we need to continue to do more,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant interior secretary for water and science, said at the recent Colorado River water users conference. “In addition to the short-term emergency decisions we will be making, we also need to be very real about the challenge of building long-term solutions in this basin.” Advertisement  This month, Arizona, California, Nevada, and the federal government announced a plan to temporarily address water shortages. The plan commits $200 million toward projects to stabilize Lake Mead and leave billions more gallons of water in the river through 2023.Looking ahead, however, a fundamental question looms for those sharing the river: The current drought contingency policies, which govern how the parties share cuts during times of water shortage, will expire in 2026. They were designed to be temporary, but it appears increasingly clear that a drier climate may be a permanent reality for the southwest. So now it must be resolved: What will happen when those agreements expire? And who will make those decisions?
 


A seat at the tableSince the 1920s, management of the river has been dominated by the seven Western states that signed the 1922 Colorado River Compact. A foundational document guiding how the river is managed, the compact split the river’s water between the “upper basin” states of Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico and the “lower basin” states of Nevada, Arizona, and California. Advertisement  But it failed to allocate water for the 30 sovereign tribes of the Colorado River Basin (a majority of which have water rights that predate the compact), the northern states of Mexico, where the river ends, or for the health of the river itself.A century later, with clear evidence of the consequences of these exclusions, the region’s sovereign tribes and conservation groups are pushing for a seat at the table with the states and the federal government as they approach negotiations to set new rules for post-2026 management of the river.To this day, the basin’s 30 sovereign tribes aren’t formally part of the decision-making bodies governing the Colorado River, despite holding water rights to 20% of its water, an amount greater than allocated to some states in the region.Daryl Vigil, co-facilitator of the Water & Tribes Initiative, a leading group in the Colorado River Basin advocating for more equitable and sustainable policies, says tribes need an institutionalized way to engage in policy-making. “Without this, we cannot exercise our sovereignty or right to self-determination,” he said.The basin tribes were not included in 2007 intrastate and federal negotiations to develop the first interim guidelines responding to drought conditions. In 2012, when basin states and the Department of Interior completed a study to “assess current and future water and supply imbalances,” the water usage and rights of the tribes were not adequately considered, leading to a separate study that was published years later. Advertisement  Despite being marginalized, the basin’s tribes are taking on a leadership role as water shortages have deepened, offering solutions and being among the first water users to contribute water to support critical drought plans.In 2019, The Gila River Indian Community and the Colorado River Indian Tribes' willingness to conserve water was critical to the success of drought contingency plans. In the recent $200 million deal to conserve additional water through 2023, the Gila River Indian Community and the Colorado River Indian Tribes collectively contributed over a quarter of the water pledged. Yet the underlying framework that currently guides the river’s operations was made without their input.The basin tribes’ continued involvement in the process depends on executive memorandums and statements of commitment. No legally binding documents or formally established positions guarantee them a place in the bodies that govern the river.“The [1922] compact talks about an equitable apportionment of water in the Colorado River Basin, but when it was created, my tribe was living on subsistence rations in a place that wasn’t our homeland. So much of the current framework surrounding this river is based on legislation and policy that tribes have had no formal access to,” Vigil said. “You have 30 tribal sovereigns in the Colorado Basin that have lived sustainably here for thousands of years. Why aren’t we including people in the conversation who have known how to live resiliently?” Advertisement  
 


In a recent letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, leaders from 20 tribes in the basin called on her to ensure tribal sovereigns have a clear role in upcoming negotiations to develop the next framework governing the Colorado River. The letter also announced the creation of a Colorado River Basin Tribal Coalition, where leaders will gather to build consensus on new policies, and asked the Interior Department to encourage states to meaningfully engage with tribes in their internal and interstate negotiations. Advertisement  Tribal water rights are considered as part of states’ overall allocations of water from the river. As tribes reach water settlements, states have to account for this water from their portion of the river. But with increasing pressure on states to cut existing water usage during shortages, the interests of state water managers do not always align with the interests of the basin’s tribes as they actualize their water rights.Responding to the tribes’ letter, Haaland wrote that the Interior Department intends to hold “listening sessions” with tribal leadership in 2022. Trujillo, who is tasked with leading that process, said in an interview that the department will incorporate feedback into future negotiations, but she declined to specify if they would formally establish a place for tribal leaders.
 


As the basin’s tribes push for representation in upcoming negotiations for the river’s future, they are navigating a related inequity — access to clean water.Despite holding significant rights to the Colorado River, many of the basin’s tribes lack water security. On Navajo Nation, the largest reservation in the basin, 30 to 40 percent of residents lack indoor plumbing and haul water to meet their basic needs. Compared to other Americans, Navajo residents are 67 times more likely to live without access to running water.“If we look at these issues through the lens of people not having access to water, they are just different aspects of the same fundamental problem,"" said Bidtah Becker, Associate Attorney for the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority. “Have we separated water issues so far that we no longer see the connection between the shortages of water currently being experienced on the river and the fact that there are people in this basin who do not have access to clean water from that very river?” Advertisement  
 


Water shortage as an opportunityMany conservation groups active in the Colorado River Basin view the post-2026 negotiations as a chance to build a management system that’s flexible enough to respond to the impacts of climate change as the river shrinks. With billions in federal funding newly allocated in the 2021 infrastructure bill for addressing impacts of water shortages, Western states have resources to invest in a variety of solutions. Advertisement  “There are so many things we can do beyond debating water allocations,” said Jennifer Pitt, director of the Audubon’s Colorado River Program. “This is climate change barging through the front door of the Colorado River Basin. It calls for all hands on deck. We cannot get by in the long run with a short-term solution stacked on top of a short-term solution. We need long-term resilience plans and systems thinking.”Just south of the US–Mexico border, a binational coalition of conservation groups called Raise the River is slowly rebuilding areas of critical natural habitat in the river’s former delta. In the last decade, the coalition has restored over 1,500 acres across several restoration sites with an amount of water that, Pitt said, amounts to less than 1% of the river’s annual flow. According to Audubon’s research, restored sites along the Colorado River delta have species populations that are 80% greater than those of lands not yet restored.At Laguna Grande, the largest of the sites, dragonflies dart across deep pools ringed by mesquite trees, and desert temperatures noticeably drop under the shade of cottonwoods. Here, it feels possible to imagine how alive the delta once was. Advertisement  Securing water for the project required building partnerships between the US and Mexican governments, creating a water trust, raising millions of dollars, and passing two treaty agreements. The treaties were the first of their kind in the basin to designate water specifically for nature and the river itself. Pitt pointed to the delta restoration project as an example of how collaboration can benefit people, animals, and the river.“Rather than being a scary, dangerous prospect to bring excluded parties to table, I think we are actually seeing more parties with a broader solution set willing to think creatively,” Pitt said.Planning focused on building resilience is increasingly supported by a number of groups. A recent report issued by the Nature Conservancy, American Rivers, Environmental Defense Fund, and several other nonprofits identifies 10 strategies for policymakers to consider as they search for solutions for the Western water crisis. Ranging from the more theoretical, such as ways to slow snow melting, to the well established, such as technology that increases agricultural efficiency, the report proposes a broader approach to addressing water shortages.
 


Water is life“Our people were specifically put where we are along these rivers and streams…We are born from water,” said McDowell, explaining the Fort Mojave Indian Tribe’s historical connection to the Colorado River. “The Creator placed us here when he created us. The heartbreak is to see it being misused and seeing it over allocated. Because it is a living spirit.” Advertisement     The story of the Colorado River is thousands of years old, but we are still very much at the start of the next chapter of its existence — one in which the centrality of water to life, and its deep interconnections, will only grow clearer as scarcity intensifies. The changing climate will become an inescapable fact of life for everyone in the West.“We have to anticipate that future inflows will be less than [those of] the last 22 years,” said senior water and climate scientist Brad Udall, calling on policymakers to be realistic and develop future management plans based on data, which indicates a much drier future. “When I hear the phrase ‘new normal,’ I actually get a little frustrated. … What we are seeing is not anything related to normal. Normal implies predictability. This climate is not stationary; it is going to continue to change, and people need to plan for less water.”While progress has been made toward addressing current shortages, it remains to be seen whether long-term agreements on more fundamental changes can be reached in a basin accustomed to incremental policy adjustments — and whether political promises of cooperation and inclusion result in concrete actions. Advertisement     “Water gives us life,” McDowell said. “People need to start thinking about the impacts of our use of this river from a long-term perspective — not just about how much money this company or person is going to make. If we’re not careful in what we decide, we will cease to exist.”

The US set a global record on Monday with 1 million new COVID cases reported in a single day, as the highly contagious Omicron variant spreads and accounts for the majority of cases across the nation.The 1,017,376 cases recorded on Jan. 3 by the New York Times come with a few caveats: The long holiday weekend caused a backlog in reporting cases, which boosted the number reported on a single day. Meanwhile, testing has been hard to access, which means more people may be positive than what has been recorded. Advertisement     What we do know is that the country is in a very steep growth period for new cases, with a seven-day rolling average of 480,916. This new phase of the coronavirus pandemic has strained testing availability, disrupted businesses, and frustrated those who are fully vaccinated but catching Omicron, although the vaccines are reducing serious illness and death.
 


Still, the number of people hospitalized with COVID is surging past the peak of the Delta variant wave in early September 2021, and the percentage of PCR tests turning up positive is at the highest it’s ever been during the pandemic, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services. Advertisement     Bay Area resident Brittany McCulley woke up with a sniffly nose, itchy throat, and a minor cough Tuesday morning and immediately went to get tested for COVID. The 22-year-old hairstylist is 27 weeks pregnant, fully vaccinated, and received a booster dose to protect her from the virus. The test was positive.“I immediately started crying,” McCulley told BuzzFeed News, adding that she felt “absolutely horrified,” “scared,” and “exhausted” by the news. “I’m tired of people acting like nothing is going to affect them, that if they get it, it’s fine because it’ll be ‘mild,’ while it poses serious risks to other people around them.”
 


McCulley will now miss work and two prenatal doctor’s appointments over the next 10 days.“I’m going to struggle to pay bills now,” she said.She believes she was exposed at work because coworkers have also begun to feel sick. McCulley said her major concern is potential complications to her pregnancy, such as preterm labor (a risk researchers have stressed for pregnant people who contract the virus).People such as McCulley, who tested positive after the holidays, posted on social media about their need to change flights at the last minute or voiced concern that family members may also test positive.
 


Doctor's appointments, school schedules, and employers have all been thrown into a confusing reality about how to best mitigate the virus and continue in any form of normalcy. Those testing positive also said they are feeling ashamed of putting colleagues and loved ones at risk.“I’m frustrated more than anything because I wish I hadn’t exposed any of my coworkers, but I didn’t know,” said Lark W., who works at a rock climbing gym in Salt Lake City.Lark (who did not share their last name for privacy reasons) is fully vaccinated and has a booster shot scheduled for next week. They were exposed to COVID on Dec. 26 and took at-home tests on Dec. 29 and 30, each of which returned a negative result.“I did the best I could with the resources I had,” the 22-year-old told BuzzFeed News.Citing the negative tests, they made the decision to go to work. But over the holiday weekend, Lark started feeling sick. On Tuesday morning, they tested positive.“The fact that there’s so many cases makes it even more maddening that there’s absolutely no support,” they said. “I’m the ninth or tenth person at my job to test positive in the last couple months, and the best they’ve offered is reminding us of the three paid sick days we get per year.”But three days won’t make up for the extra seven days of lost income.“I don’t really care about the effect of this on my social life; I can spend 10 days at home no problem,” they said, “but I can’t afford to not work.”The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its isolation guidelines on Dec. 27, recommending a shorter five-day quarantine period for asymptomatic people, and then again on Tuesday with additional recommendations around antigen testing and travel.
 


Soaring cases are also coming at a time when high numbers of non-COVID patients are being admitted to emergency rooms for other reasons, experts say, straining resources. According to the HHS data, about 26% of ICU beds are being used for COVID cases as of Tuesday (of 5,448 national hospitals who report this data to the department).The federal government’s response has been to reiterate the importance of vaccination, the necessity of wearing a mask, and the value of testing and other available methods to stop the spread of the virus.“You can control how big an impact Omicron is going to have on your health,” President Joe Biden said Tuesday in remarks regarding the record number of reported cases. “If you’re unvaccinated, you have some reason to be alarmed.”Biden also announced that FEMA has been ordered to provide additional hospital beds and that his administration will double the number of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID treatment pills to 20 million. The first batch of the FDA-approved oral drug was shipped out on Dec. 24.“They’re a game changer,” Biden said about the pill, which takes months to manufacture. “Production is in full swing.”But testing remains a frustration around the country, with long lines, a lack of rapid antigen tests, and few ways for people who test positive at home to report that to authorities. Starting next week, insurance providers will be required to reimburse people for at-home tests. Biden said a government website will launch later this month where people can request free at-home tests.The virus has also posed an issue for schools returning from the holiday break this week. Public school districts in Newark, Atlanta, Milwaukee, and Cleveland have even opted to revert to virtual learning amid the rise in cases, marking a regression to safety measures made early in the pandemic.Although the federal government is pushing hard for schools to remain open, many have struggled with staffing as teachers and administrators become ill themselves. And students who test positive risk falling behind as classes commence.
 


Tiki Duquella is a fully vaccinated student at a private high school in Knoxville, Tennessee. He tested positive for COVID on Tuesday and will have to miss a week of school and cancel a weekend trip to New York to visit friends. While his symptoms are “very minimal,” he said, he was glad a test confirmed they were COVID-related.“I went to get a test because my school started up again and I did not want to get my classmates/faculty sick,” Duquella said. Like so many in the country, he is already struggling to catch up just days into the new year. “It’s the first week, so I feel like it will be pretty difficult to start my second semester a week behind,” he said.Peter Aldhous contributed reporting to this story.

218,People were stuck in their cars for almost 24 hours in Virginia following a winter storm and more nightmarish factors.,"


An “unprecedented” traffic jam amid a foot of snow and icy roads has forced hundreds of motorists to spend the night in their vehicles on Interstate 95 in Virginia between Richmond and Washington, DC.The horror gridlock along both directions of the 50-mile stretch of road was the result of a nightmarish confluence of factors: A winter storm dumped 12 inches of snow in the Fredericksburg area on Monday, freezing temperatures saw the roads turn to ice, trucks and tractor trailers slid and crashed into one another, downed trees turned into yet more roadblocks, and then yet more snow and ice accumulated around the disabled vehicles, making it exceedingly difficult for rescue workers to clear the roads.The chaos ensnared scores of drivers for interminable lengths of time, some of whom were driving home after the holidays, others doing what was supposed to be a quick errand.
 


""I thought I'd just throw the dogs in the car — it's only an hour drive, it should be fine,"" said Susan Phalen, who left for her house in Alexandria from her parents' home in Fredericksburg around 8 p.m. after they lost power there.Phalen said she was without internet when she set out on her journey and wasn't able to see warnings online to avoid the I-95 until it was too late.""The traffic rolled pretty easily around 20 mph for the first 4 or 5 miles, and then it came to an abrupt halt,"" she said.As time dragged on, Phalen began feeling despondent. ""You keep hoping for the best and thinking that any minute the traffic will go, and then the hours wear on,"" she said. ""It just gets frustrating.""
 


Phalen said that while she was able to stay warm by keeping her car idling due to a full tank of gas, she worried for those in the cars around her. If things got worse, she said, she thought she could try to escape on foot with her dogs, but she worried for older drivers or motorists with young children. Advertisement     ""What starts as a frustrating situation turns into a crisis for a lot of people,"" she said.Despondent motorists reported not seeing any state troopers or plows for hours, but Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) officials tried to assure them they were on the case.“We wish we had a timetable, ETA, or an educated guess on when travel will resume on I-95. It's at a standstill in our area with multiple incidents,” VDOT officials wrote on Twitter on Monday night. “It's frustrating & scary. Please know our crews don't stop.”VDOT said it was aware of some drivers who had been stuck on the interstate since Monday morning.“This is unprecedented,” VDOT Fredericksburg District Engineer Marcie Parker said in a statement, “and we continue to steadily move stopped trucks to make progress toward restoring lanes.”
 


Among those stuck was one of the state’s own senators, Tim Kaine, who wrote on Twitter that what should have been a two-hour drive from his home in Virginia to DC had ballooned into 19 hours.NBC News reporter Josh Lederman was another driver forced to spend the night with his dog in the backseat. As day broke, he began doing TV hits live from his stranded vehicle.
 


Gov. Ralph Northam said state officials had worked through the night to try to clear I-95.“​​State and local emergency personnel are continuing to clear downed trees, assist disabled vehicles, and reroute drivers,” Northam said. “An emergency message is going to all stranded drivers connecting them to support, and the state is working with localities to open warming shelters as needed.” Advertisement     Speaking in a Twitter Space for trapped motorists, one man said he survived the night by eating chocolate-covered cherries he had been gifted at Christmas. Another said he had been at a standstill since 11 p.m. just 1 mile from his house but didn’t want to abandon his car despite being frustratingly close to home.“My car was also stuck in the middle of the road. I didn’t know the situation,” he said. “Unless it’s valet, I ain’t leaving it.""It took until late Tuesday afternoon for VDOT to finally announce there were no longer any stranded people. ""Less than 20 vehicles left to be removed from the interstate before plow trains will come through to remove snow and ice from the travel lanes,"" officials said in a tweet.Phalen finally reached her Alexandria home around 16 hours after she had first set out, relieved that she was able to feed her dogs and shower. She was also looking forward to getting some rest after staying awake all night: ""I didn't sleep because I thought that sure enough I'll fall asleep and then the traffic will move and I'll be the one to slow things down.""

219,One of the creators of Google Glass has been experimenting with a high-tech dental retainer that works as a communications tool by tracking the movement of your tongue.,"


A project led by one of the key creators of Google Glass, the tech giant’s influential but ultimately ill-fated smart eyewear, aims to let people have conversations without talking or using their hands to type, sign, or gesture.Called SilentSpeller, the project is a communication system that allows people to send texts using a high-tech dental retainer to spell out words without actually voicing them, according to a demo video and academic paper reviewed by BuzzFeed News. The device works by tracking the movement of the user’s tongue. Researchers claim the system identifies letters with 97% accuracy, and 93% accuracy for entire words. Advertisement     The research is the brainchild of Thad Starner, a pioneer in wearable technology. Starner played a lead technical role in developing Google Glass, the much-hyped device that helped introduce the world to a new genre of gadgets beyond smartphones. But the device courted controversy and pushed the bounds of society’s relationship with technology when Google introduced it almost a decade ago. SilentSpeller, by contrast, is a research project out of the Georgia Institute of Technology, where Starner is a professor, so the goal for now is more academic than product road map.However, the device could eventually be used to help people with movement disorders including Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor, Starner told BuzzFeed News in an interview. He also sees potential consumer applications, like hands-free communication in really quiet places, like a library, or really loud places where people would have to strain their voices to be heard.To develop SilentSpeller, researchers didn’t create a whole new retainer from scratch. Instead, they jury-rigged an existing product called SmartPalate, which looks like the kind of retainer used by orthodontists but is loaded with tiny sensors to track tongue movement for speech therapy. Software creates a visual map of how someone’s tongue functions while speaking, but while SmartPalate’s primary use is to help people correct speech disorders, researchers working on SilentSpeller adapted the system to transform the retainer into a communications tool.
 


The device reads tongue movements through the retainer’s 124 sensors, according to the academic paper. The data is then sent to a personal computer or smartphone through a USB wire. For now that means that users of the prototype will have a wire dangling from their mouths, but researchers believe they could eventually create a wireless version that fits entirely in the mouth. The device requires a dental impression for a custom-fitting retainer. Although researchers have been working on the project since January 2020, progress has been slowed because the COVID-19 pandemic has limited the number of participants that could get fitted for custom retainers.The effort is not a Google project, but it has the fingerprints of the company’s researchers on it. Starner is still a part-time research scientist at Google focusing on machine learning. Another author on the academic paper is Alex Olwal, a senior Google research scientist that leads the company’s Interaction Lab, an initiative aimed at intertwining digital and physical experiences. Olwal is also a technical lead for Google’s augmented reality division.The demo video for the project, published on Olwal’s YouTube channel, features Olwal testing out the device. His eyes are blurred out, but a Google spokesperson confirmed it’s him.
 


Google Research, an arm of the company that focuses on pure science and technological breakthroughs, is credited as a collaborator in the demo video, but the company spokesperson, as well as Starner, said the effort was not considered a Google Research project. Advertisement     The lead researcher of the project, Naoki Kimura, is a graduate student from the University of Tokyo and an exchange student studying under Starner at Georgia Tech, Starner said. Other researchers on the project come from universities including Carnegie Mellon and the University of Washington. The project was presented in May at the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, which normally takes place in Yokohama, Japan, but was held virtually amid the pandemic. The project, however, hasn't been widely known.Devices worn on — or in this case inside — the body have become a bigger focus of research over the last several years as tech becomes infused in more aspects of people’s lives. An Apple Watch can take an electrocardiogram with sensors that track your heartbeat. Facebook’s parent company Meta makes virtual reality headsets for tapping into the so-called metaverse, which tech executives describe as an immersive world with a mix of both digital and physical elements. For years, Facebook was also developing a “brain-computer interface” with the goal of allowing people to communicate by imagining the words they wanted to type, but the company pulled the plug on that project in July. Google has created internet-connected jackets and bags, and for a time the company experimented with smart contact lenses with glucose readers for people with diabetes.But as people start to use more of these devices, privacy concerns have cropped up. A device that fits into a person’s mouth could open the door to invasive types of data collection, said John Davisson, senior counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC, a Washington, DC–based nonprofit. A nightmare scenario, he said, might be a company gathering information about a person’s saliva or dental records. While that’s a long-term concern for a new generation of devices that deal with biometric data, there’s no indication SilentSpeller would have the capability to do anything like that.“It’s sort of obvious, the sensitivity of a device that goes inside of your head,” Davisson said. “That’s going to present some privacy risks.” He added there would need to be strict safeguards on what information it could collect. Advertisement     In the academic paper for SilentSpeller, researchers list a handful of use cases. In addition to helping people with limited dexterity and other consumers, there might even be applications on the battlefield. One use case, according to the paper, is “United Nations operations where silent communication is key.” The corresponding drawing is of two heavily armored soldiers holding assault rifles. In speech bubbles, the soldiers discuss tactical strategy, presumably through SilentSpeller.This isn’t the first time Google scientists have worked with university researchers. Google has long had a tight-knit relationship with academia, stemming from the company's start as a Stanford University project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, then graduate students. For 15 years, the company awarded financial grants to academic researchers called the Google Faculty Research Awards. In 2020, the company discontinued that program and said it would instead focus on supporting up-and-coming researchers and faculty working on projects that serve underrepresented communities. That year, CNET reported on several projects funded by Google Research or developed by the Interaction Lab. They included temporary tattoos that transform a person’s body into a living touchpad when applied to the skin and sunglasses that project holographic icons.

220,"The MCU never really deals with the ramifications and implications of the blip, but this is maybe not so very different from what it's like to live through surreal, unbelievable events.","


Here’s a cheerful holiday question, as we enter the third year of a once-a-century pandemic: What does it feel like to live through the world ending?This is — if you really, really zoom out — the question that occupies the aggregate Marvel Cinematic Universe. I’m not saying this is why everyone sees Marvel movies. Obviously not. They make money for the normal reasons of being entertaining, with some of the best and most charismatic actors in large-scale, interlocking adventure stories that occasionally elevate into greatness; they are without pretension and with the natural pull of superheroes (having a favorite). They are a good time. Advertisement  What I am saying, however, is that a real depth of the MCU derives, paradoxically, from a hollowness at its core: It's a series about the world ending via surreal external forces that never really deals with what it means for the world to end.I’ve been thinking about this for three reasons: a. The pandemic just won’t end, b. I have somehow seen six of the nine Marvel properties released in 2021, including Eternals, c. I happened to catch some of Iron Man recently.At the time of release, the original Iron Man was a true product of the George W. Bush years. In 2008, the film's sunshine wittiness and rejection of defense-contractor WMDs sat against the dominant superhero series of that era: Christopher Nolan's Batman. On some level, The Dark Knight, also released in 2008, concerns how far Americans should go to eradicate terrorism and what happens to those who do and why anyone would pursue that at all — a more realist (in presentation), more violent venture into the soul, where you might see a tattered American flag waving in the early morning sun. Rather than bleak, Iron Man is fun. Advertisement  Thirteen long, long years later, Iron Man — if you watch it right now — loses all that Bush-era context and gains a different one. If that exact movie were released today, given all that’s come since within the constructed MCU and in the unfolding trajectory of our real lives, you'd almost expect arch title cards at the beginning: “This was back before the aliens started invading and half the world's population disappeared for five years.” Back when things were messed up, back before they got REALLY messed up, possibly where it all began. It’s a much simpler, more contained movie, where the problems are entirely man-made and direct. Aliens don’t invade; people aren’t forced to kill each other or themselves to protect humanity; there isn’t even that much of a mysterious next property to set up yet.
 


Because Marvel has decided (so far) against completely rebooting existing properties under the Disney banner, the shows and films have begun to acknowledge how weird and extreme the last 10 years of the parallel Marvel world was.The latest Disney+ title, Hawkeye, opens with an 11-year-old girl — Kate Bishop (eventually Hailee Steinfeld) — watching aliens destroy her family’s penthouse and kill her father in 2012, i.e., a scene from the first Avengers movie, from a spectator’s perspective. These touches are usually more comic than anything: In that series’ present day, Hawkeye eyes “Thanos Was Right” graffiti, and catches a terrible musical rendition of the Avengers history. In Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Shaun (Simu Liu) walks past flyers advertising help coping with the blip: “POST-BLIP ANXIETY? YOU ARE NOT ALONE.” His college friend tells him, basically, it's time to grow up because you never know when half of humanity, including you, might disappear again.The more surface touches of this, though, weirdly, are reminiscent of the surface touches of the pandemic. The New York subways remain plastered, for instance, with an ad advising proper mask-wearing, featuring a consistent black-ink cartoon style against a rich gold-yellow backdrop. These cartoon characters started in summer 2020; they got winter clothes toward Christmas last year; they started reminding you to wear a mask even if you're vaccinated in the spring; now they remind you to wear a mask, ask you to read or look at your phone instead of talking, and get a booster vaccine (""Need a boost?""). Staring at one while on your way to the dentist has that same sort of surrealist humdrum irony touch. Advertisement  
 


Nothing deals with the preceding decade of the MCU without really dealing with the decade more than Spider-Man: Far From Home. That movie opens with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) arguing about how not every catastrophe is aliens, the catastrophe apparently being aliens, then a segue into a meme-looking high school PA in memoriam of fallen Avengers set to “I Will Always Love You,” and a recap of people returning from the blip with a lament that people had to take midterms and a returned marching band member getting hit in the face with a basketball. Shortly thereafter, Spider-Man and a joking Aunt May do a Salvation Army fundraiser for everyone in New York displaced from their homes by their own disappearance. Now Far From Home rules (many Spider-Mans converge on Spider-Man in a trippy virtual reality), and arguably a jokiness fits both Spider-Man and the overall realm of high school, but it does not per se encompass all the emotions that might follow half the earth’s population atomizing temporarily. Advertisement  Elsewhere in Phase Four of the MCU, this occasionally goes deeper, if briefly, like the suggestion of Kate Bishop’s origin story. WandaVision features Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) waking up from the blip in a cancer ward to find her mother died a long time ago; the hospital is total chaos. Hawkeye opens one episode with Florence Pugh’s Yelena stepping into a powder room and seeing herself disappear and reemerge in the blip, with the walls changing color around her as time jumps ahead five years. When she exits, her old friend has a husband and a child. The overall effect in 2021 is: Oh damn, it’s like the pandemic.What they aren’t really doing is dealing too much with how everyone keeps living their lives — on any deeper, presumably more emotionally chaotic level — despite the actual mass death, destruction, and resurrection that the Marvel world puts forward. The story stays pretty contained to a few dozen heroes; absolution is usually not too hard to achieve; the next thing is always coming, and whatever it is, it will follow the rhythms of the first thing. We all know to expect the last 15 to 30 minutes of a Marvel enterprise to be consumed by a CGI fight in the air with aliens/robots/dragons/witches (so much so that Spider-Man: Far From Home’s villain operates on that expectation) intermingled with some forward-looking irresolution. Even with (fun!) characters like Kate Bishop, Marvel doesn’t really delve too deeply into how and why the collapsing earth resulted in a wealthy 22-year-old beating up mafia bros (beyond a dope opening credits sequence).WandaVision, for instance, tells a very specific, deep Twilight Zone story about how the mind can try to rewrite a brutal, shocking loss. But when the narrative ventures toward how that kind of grief — no matter how real — can inflict pain on other people, the show backs away from dealing with the implications of what Marvel’s heroes wrought, in favor of the next thing (promoting Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange). Which is, actually, mostly fine; not everything must be The Leftovers or Crime and Punishment, and WandaVision offered plenty of compelling cuts of a life undone. And Spider-Man: Far From Home is fun as hell and they shouldn’t have changed anything about it. Advertisement  
 


The more I’ve thought about this eternal setup at the expense of the current thing, though, it’s seemed to me almost like an accidental depth, one that speaks to the last decade, in which it’s occasionally felt like the world is ending — or at least becoming complicated beyond previous recognition. And I wouldn’t exactly say this fundamental feature of the MCU makes most of these titles excellent art on the individual level about what it feels like for the world to feel like it’s ending.But taken together, at the 100,000-foot level, the fact that each property is basically about someone doing what they were doing anyway, then having to deal with some new iteration of surreal but familiar external forces invading, and never having any time to really think about what it all means because the next thing is already happening, as it turns out — now that we really do live in a notable historical period of continual surreal events that could make you question the foundations of society — everyone has to continue doing what they were doing anyway when the world is ending, and you’ll never have that much time to think about what it all means because the demands of the next thing will be upon you.What does it feel like when the world ends? It just feels like aliens invading until something else happens. ●

222,What’s the punishment for storming the Capitol? A BuzzFeed News analysis shows judges are struggling to figure it out.,"


Join HuffPost and BuzzFeed News for a Twitter Spaces conversation about how the Capitol riot is still altering US politics on Jan. 4 at 1 p.m. ET. Sign up to be notified when the Space begins here.
 


WASHINGTON — What is the punishment for someone who admits they joined in on an attack on democracy?For Jordan Stotts of Minnesota, it was two years on probation, with two months of tighter limits on when he can leave home. He scaled a wall to join the breach of the US Capitol, was captured on camera shouting at officers in the rotunda, and vowed to return, posting on Facebook: “Patriots! I got kicked out but I’ll be back!”For Lori and Thomas Vinson of Kentucky, it was five years on probation plus a $5,000 fine. Prosecutors had wanted jail time for Lori — she told an interviewer after she was fired from her job for participating in the riot, “I would do it again tomorrow” — but a judge didn’t agree.For Boyd Camper of Montana, it was two months in jail. As he joined the mob streaming into the building, he filmed his trek on a GoPro. He told a news crew outside later, “We’re going to take this damn place.”The task of fashioning justice for people who admitted to participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection has fallen to 22 judges on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The court’s members — a mix of Democrat and Republican appointees — have made clear they believe the assault on the Capitol was serious and violent, and that people convicted of crimes deserve punishment. They just don’t agree on what it should be. Advertisement  Some judges have bristled that prosecutors struck plea deals for low-level misdemeanors that limit the sentences they can impose. Some have imposed sentences that were harsher than the government’s recommendation; others have been more lenient. Some have questioned the varying sentences proposed by prosecutors across a spectrum of Capitol rioters who pleaded guilty to the same offense.It is “no wonder,” US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell said at an October sentencing, that some people “are confused about whether what happened on Jan. 6 was a petty offense of trespassing or shocking criminal conduct that represented a grave threat to our democratic norms.”Judges have had no patience for Donald Trump supporters trying to use the courthouse as a forum to relitigate President Joe Biden’s win in 2020. But the lack of consensus on the bench about what exactly justice should look like for each person who joined the mob mirrors a lack of consensus nationwide about how to think about the insurrection and its aftermath.The most common sentence has been probation, with a short period of home confinement or a fine mixed in, according to BuzzFeed News’ tracking of every prosecution filed in the year since the Jan. 6 attack. Probation means people can mostly return to their normal lives, with conditions — they have to regularly report to a probation officer, get permission to travel, submit to a home inspection at any time, and hold a job. They can’t have guns or other weapons. Violating probation by committing new crimes or failing to comply with other terms is a standalone crime that can be prosecuted. Advertisement  Nearly all of the 71 defendants sentenced as of the end of December pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, with most deals featuring the same charge: illegally parading in the Capitol, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $5,000 fine.In more than half of these misdemeanor sentencings, judges ordered punishments that were lighter than what the government argued for in terms of jail or home detention. Two-thirds of defendants sentenced for misdemeanor pleas didn’t receive any jail time.If you have more information about Jan. 6 or the legal fights in its aftermath, contact this reporter at zoe.tillman@buzzfeed.com, or see other ways to send tips here.Prosecutors have not charged everyone accused of descending on the Capitol with felonies that reflect the political nature of the overarching criminal event, which temporarily halted Congress’ certification of the election and the peaceful transfer of power. No one has been charged with sedition or insurrection, both rarely brought offenses. A top Justice Department official said early on that sedition was being explored for “the most heinous acts,” along with conspiracy; more than 50 people have been charged with that latter crime.Of the 700-plus people charged so far, BuzzFeed News’ analysis shows that just over half are facing at least one felony. The most common felony count is for obstructing an official proceeding; those cases have tended to involve some specific evidence that defendants were actively trying to disrupt the special session of Congress, such as making it to the floor of the Senate or expressing their intent in interviews or online. The obstruction offense has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, although nonviolent, first-time offenders are likely to face far less than that, and prosecutors have already agreed to let some defendants plead down to a misdemeanor. There are also felony cases pending against people charged with assaulting police, carrying or using weapons, and civil disorder. Advertisement  Everyone else is being hit solely with misdemeanor charges for illegally being in the Capitol, disorderly conduct, and parading, a collection of counts carrying maximum penalties between six months to a year in jail. The US attorney’s office in Washington focused plea offers this year on the less serious cases with lower stakes. It’s a strategy that not only clears cases and frees up resources, but also is in keeping with broader trends across the US justice system, where the overwhelming majority of criminal cases end in plea bargains.This process means that justice for an attack on democracy is filtering through a criminal justice system largely built around agreements that are hammered out in secret between the accused (the rioters) and the accusers (the prosecutors), and sentences crafted by a single judge. The riot was the violent culmination of a monthslong effort led by Trump and his supporters to undo millions of votes cast in a presidential election, but there’s little to no opportunity for public input on the consequences for people who participated.
 


Judges have talked from the bench about the challenge of applying the normal rules to an unprecedented event like Jan. 6. They’ve explained that they have to treat each defendant as an individual and can’t punish them for the full spectrum of criminal activity committed at the Capitol.With most defendants admitting to the same misdemeanors on paper, judges are picking apart the details of their words and actions as compared to other rioters. They’re weighing how those details make a person more or less individually responsible for the threat — potential or actualized — posed by the mob.How many minutes did a defendant spend in the Capitol? Did they walk through a breached door or climb through a broken window? Where did they go? How far inside did they travel? Did they capture photos or video? Did they take selfies, and did they look happy to be there? Did they witness violence or vandalism and keep going? Did they publicly brag about it online, or only send messages to friends and family, and does that distinction matter? Is the remorse they expressed later legitimate or are they just sorry they got caught, and, really, how can anyone know for sure?And the big question that’s loomed over the conclusion of each of these cases: Is there any sentence that could dissuade people from storming the Capitol in January 2025 if they disagree with the results of the next presidential election? Advertisement  For some judges, the obvious answer is jail. In the handful of cases where a defendant has pleaded guilty to a felony like assaulting police or obstructing Congress, judges have imposed months or years of prison. The length of incarceration in misdemeanor cases may be short by comparison, but judges have said they hope the threat of any loss of liberty scares off other people, disappointed or furious when the candidate they supported loses an election, from taking matters into their own hands.US District Judge Tanya Chutkan has emerged as an early proponent of time behind bars for misdemeanor offenders. At a sentencing in early October, she ordered Matthew Mazzocco of Texas to spend 45 days in jail, becoming the first judge to go above the amount of time the government recommended. She chastised Mazzocco for treating the riot like “entertainment” — he’d posted a celebratory selfie in front of the Capitol on Facebook with the caption, “The capital is ours!” and took photos of himself smiling inside and outside the building — and said a harsher sentence was needed as a warning to others.“There have to be consequences for participating in an attempted violent overthrow of the government, beyond sitting at home,” Chutkan said at the time. Advertisement  Other judges aren’t convinced that time behind bars is justified for people pleading guilty to low-level, nonviolent crimes, or if a relatively short stint in jail is even the most effective way to make the punishment “hurt,” in the words of one judge. They’ve crafted sentences featuring combinations of probation, fines, home detention, computer monitoring, social media restrictions, mental health treatment, job training, and community service.With new cases being filed every week, 71 sentences is too small a number to confirm patterns for how the rest of these cases will play out. There’s too little data, for instance, to say whether the political pathways that judges took to the bench manifest in the sentences they hand down. Judges nominated by presidents of both parties, including Trump, have mixed records of ordering jail versus probation for Capitol rioters. But most judges have only presided over a handful of sentencings, and some judges haven’t sentenced anyone yet.Still, enough cases have reached the final phase to understand what judges are thinking about as they mete out justice. They’re aware of the intense media coverage of these cases and the fact that the court allows the public to dial in to hear live audio of most hearings, a pandemic-related expansion of access. They’re keeping an eye on the investigation into Jan. 6 that’s unfolding in Congress, and they’re paying close attention to what their colleagues are doing — sometimes publicly signaling when they agree or disagree with another judge’s decision or comments.There was the case where US District Judge Trevor McFadden accused the Justice Department of not being “even-handed” in its response to Jan. 6 compared to the protests last summer against racism and police brutality — comments that prompted Chutkan in another case to say she disagreed with McFadden, calling it a “false equivalence.” It was one of the few times where the broader political discourse seemed to seep into public exchanges among judges; McFadden was nominated by Trump, Chutkan by former president Barack Obama. There was the case where US District Judge Rudolph Contreras accused prosecutors of ramping up their sentencing recommendations because they were yelled at by another judge. Advertisement  Several judges have expressed concern about the case of Anna Morgan-Lloyd, who made an emotional plea for leniency to US District Judge Royce Lamberth and received probation. Morgan-Lloyd then went on Fox News the day after her sentencing and made comments that seemed to minimize the violence at the Capitol. Morgan-Lloyd’s lawyer has insisted her client got “played” by Fox and was honest with Lamberth, but judges have held up her case as a cautionary tale against giving too much weight to after-the-fact expressions of remorse.Lamberth, meanwhile, has made it known that he felt burned by Morgan-Lloyd. When Frank Scavo of Pennsylvania came before the judge last month after pleading guilty to the same parading misdemeanor, Lamberth blew past the two-week jail sentence that the government argued for, sentencing Scavo to 60 days.A few judges have complained that charging decisions by prosecutors tied their hands in crafting sentences.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson has questioned prosecutors about the wisdom of entering plea deals for a misdemeanor that restricted the options that judges had for ordering extended court supervision. US District Judge Carl Nichols expressed the same concern at a November sentencing for David Mish of Wisconsin, saying he was “very torn” because he thought Mish could benefit from longer-term contact with the court. Nichols ended up sending Mish to jail for 30 days, citing his previous criminal record as well as the need to deter others. Advertisement  
 


It’s not the first time that federal judges in Washington have been faced with novel questions of law with massive implications for the legitimacy of the US government and its institutions. The court has presided over legal entanglements from some of the biggest political scandals in modern history — Watergate, Whitewater and the Clinton affair, the Russia probe — as well as the crush of cases filed by people captured in the War on Terror after 9/11 challenging their indefinite detention at the US military installation in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.The sheer number of Jan. 6 cases sets this prosecution effort apart. A prosecutor recently said in court that the government believed that 2,000 to 2,500 people illegally went inside the Capitol, far more than the estimate of 800 people that a US Capitol Police official gave Congress early on. Prosecutors and Justice Department officials haven’t said if there’s a target number for when they’ll end the investigation. Advertisement  The seven people sentenced for felonies have all received prison time. Paul Hodgkins of Florida, who pleaded guilty to obstructing Congress, had tried to argue for no time behind bars since he hadn’t engaged in violence or destruction; he went onto the Senate floor and carried a “TRUMP” flag. US District Judge Randolph Moss said probation wasn’t an option and ordered him to spend eight months in prison, less than the 18 months sought by prosecutors. It was a benchmark-setting hearing that spelled bad news for any defendant hoping to stay out of prison with a felony plea deal.People needed to know that assaulting the Capitol and interfering with the democratic process “will have severe consequences,” the judge said at the time.Of the 64 people sentenced for a misdemeanor offense, 36 — more than half — received sentences that were lighter than what the government recommended as far as loss of liberty, according to BuzzFeed News’ analysis. That included 14 cases where judges rejected the government’s recommendation of prison time altogether, nine cases where judges ordered a period of incarceration that was shorter than the government’s request, and 13 cases where judges didn’t agree with the government’s recommendation of a short period of home confinement as a condition of probation.
 


Forty defendants who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors — roughly two-thirds — avoided time behind bars, receiving home confinement and probation, or probation alone.The remaining 24 misdemeanor offenders were incarcerated. Nine people received prison sentences that were more severe than what the government requested, with judges either going above the amount of incarceration prosecutors asked for or rejecting a recommendation of probation. Nine people received prison sentences that fell below the government’s recommendation, and six received time behind bars that matched the government’s request.Jail sentences for misdemeanor offenders have ranged from as short as 14 days to as long as six months, although in the two cases to hit that high end the defendants already had been in jail after their arrests and were sentenced to the time they’d served.US District Judge Thomas Hogan ordered Robert Reeder to spend three months in jail, less than the six months prosecutors argued for after new evidence emerged that he’d been involved in a physical confrontation with police. Hogan said he wanted his sentence to signal that other rioters should expect jail time. But he explained that he didn’t think six months was appropriate because Reeder didn’t have a previous criminal record and the judge wasn’t sold that the evidence showed Reeder deliberately struck an officer with his fist. Advertisement     The person-specific facts of each case make it hard to do apples-to-apples comparisons, but some cases feature similar overarching narratives. Russell Peterson of Pennsylvania livestreamed on Facebook — “The Capitol is ours right now,” he said at one point — and prosecutors accused him of downplaying the violence afterward. The government asked for two weeks in jail. Jackson sentenced him to 30 days. Prosecutors wanted 60 days in jail for Glenn Croy of Colorado, arguing he’d entered the Capitol twice, treated the breach like a “vacation” by taking and posing for photos, and sent messages after that disputed the level of violence. Howell sentenced him to three months of home confinement and three years of probation.Howell has used some of the strongest language this year denouncing the insurrection and questioning prosecutors’ decision not to press more serious charges against participants. But in several misdemeanor cases, she’s rejected the government’s jail recommendations, pointing to other cases where prosecutors asked for probation for rioters who pleaded guilty to the same crimes and saying she also had an obligation to avoid “unwarranted” differences. She blasted the government’s “muddled” approach and blamed prosecutors for undercutting their own efforts.Howell’s sentences have included a period of home confinement and probation for Jack Griffith, a Tennessee man who was recorded on video screaming in excitement as he entered the Capitol and whose extensive social media posts afterward suggested a lack of remorse. Prosecutors had asked for three months of incarceration. As part of his sentence, Howell ordered the probation office to monitor his computer activity and barred him from using any social media platforms without getting permission first. Advertisement     Some judges have turned to hitting people’s pockets. In 16 cases, judges ordered defendants to pay fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 as an additional penalty beyond probation or jail; in 13 of those cases, the sentences were otherwise lighter than the government’s recommendation.Fines levied by judges are on top of agreements defendants have made to pay restitution to the US government as part of their plea deals — $500 for a misdemeanor plea, and $1,000 to $2,000 for a felony plea. Between fines ordered by judges and restitution agreements, the 160-plus rioters who have entered guilty pleas owe $148,500, roughly 10% of the nearly $1.5 million that the government has estimated in damage to the Capitol.
 


When US District Judge Reggie Walton sentenced the Vinsons, overruling the government’s request for jail time for Lori Vinson, he explained that one reason for that was he didn’t think the cost of incarcerating her was worth it. He said that he’d rather have the couple contribute toward the cost of repairing the Capitol and jail would only delay their ability to do that. Advertisement     “​​I want the sentence to hurt, because people have to understand that if you do something like this, it’s going to hurt,” Walton said, ordering them each to pay $5,000.Walton took the same approach this month in sentencing Anthony Mariotto of Florida. The prosecutor asked for four months of incarceration, arguing his misdemeanor case was more serious because of how far he’d made it into the building — he posted a selfie on Facebook from the Senate gallery, smiling, with a caption that included, “This is our house” — and the fact that he recorded assaults on police, knocked on doors, and seemed to minimize his role in an interview later.Walton sentenced Mariotto to pay a $5,000 fine and spend three years on probation. The judge said he believed that participating in the insurrection was a serious enough offense to merit incarceration. But he said he also didn’t think it was realistic to try to jail every defendant, and that it wouldn’t be appropriate since other defendants who pleaded guilty to the same crime received probation.Some judges have used the public platform they have at these sentencing hearings to make their feelings about what happened on Jan. 6 known. They’ve emphasized the seriousness of the insurrection, disputed narratives that have sprung up among right-wing politicians and pundits that rioters were “tourists” or that incarcerated defendants are “political prisoners,” and called out some of the bold-face names who haven’t been criminally charged — Trump and his allies who promoted the lie that the 2020 election was stolen (and continue to do so). Advertisement     When US District Judge Rudolph Contreras earlier this month rejected the government’s request for jail time for Felipe Marquez of Florida, the judge explained that he believed Marquez would be better served by home confinement and probation, plus a set of additional conditions including mental health treatment, job training, and other support. The judge said that Jan. 6 was the result of an “unprecedented” series of events, spurred on by Trump and his allies who “bear much responsibility” for what happened.At a sentencing in November, US District Judge Amit Mehta said that defendant John Lolos of Washington state was “a pawn in a game that’s played and directed by people who should know better.” Prosecutors wanted 30 days in jail for Lolos, who entered the Capitol through a broken window, chanted in support of the mob as he walked through the building, and yelled, “They left! We did it!” as he left. He came to law enforcement’s attention when he was kicked off a plane after the riot for being disruptive and chanting, “Trump 2020!” Mehta sentenced him to 14 days.“People like Mr. Lolos were told lies and falsehoods and told that an election was stolen when it clearly was not,” Mehta said. “Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos for whatever reason are impressionable and will believe such falsehoods and such lies ... and they are the ones who are suffering the consequences.” Advertisement     No judge has found that individual rioters weren’t culpable because they were corrupted by online conspiracy theories or inspired by Trump.“No one was swept away to the Capitol,” Jackson said at Russell Peterson’s sentencing this month. “No one was carried. The rioters were adults. And this defendant, like hundreds of others, walked there on his own two feet and he bears responsibility for his own actions. There may be others who bear greater responsibility and who also must be held accountable, but this is not their day in court, it is yours.” ●

223,"New year, new photo resolutions: We talked to 14 photographers about 2022","


2021 started off in uncertainty, with a dash of chaos, and most of us just strapped in and went along for the ride. In 2022, we’re hoping for better days ahead. No matter your stance on resolutions, the beginning of a year is a good time to check in and make some plans. We talked to some of our favorite photographers about their photo resolutions for 2022 — for the record, mine is to finally put down my mom’s camera from the ’70s and try a few new things.
 


DeSean McClinton-Holland""I’m surprised at how difficult it was for me to answer this question. With COVID spreading and businesses changing how they operate once again, it was hard to see a year that could be as productive or life-changing as this year was for me. Then a friend showed me Hello Future by Farah Al-Qasimi. That changed everything. Not only did it remind me of how much fun it is to make work with the people and objects around me, it also made me think of all the amazing work and books created during the height of the pandemic. With that in mind, I’m now inspired and hopeful that no matter what 2022 brings, anything is possible as long as I’m focused (and fearless)."" Advertisement  Gabriella Angotti-Jones""My resolution for this next year is to continue making photos that reflect my personal history. This past year I really tried to take a step back from doing quick-hit daily assignments to focus on longer-term work that represented my own life and interests. I realized that a lot of my visual vocabulary is informed by my relationships and childhood growing up at the beach. I want to continue figuring out how this influences what I see and the kinds of photos I like to make. I want to get to know more nuanced emotions within myself so I can recognize that in the things and people I photograph. It’s cool because I feel like this is an ever-evolving thing and that this will always be something I get to explore.""Yael Malka""I don’t believe in making resolutions for the new year, because they are almost always a letdown. Resolutions like that put too much pressure on making big transformations, so I prefer to make goals in a more organic way throughout the year. Advertisement  ""Something I have been working on this year and will continue to move towards in the new year is balance — perhaps that will be a lifelong feat? I want more balance between making my own work and making the work I get paid for. I want more balance between working and taking time for myself and not feeling guilty about it. I want to get better at remembering that productivity does not just come in the form of working, but also in relaxing, learning, and feeling joyful. Of course I also want to shoot really cool stories that I care about deeply and make tons of new work and exhibit it, but I also want to remember the importance of having those in-between moments — a lot of times that’s where the best ideas come out for me.""
 


Devin Yalkin""I'd love to have two books finished by the end of next year with a plane ticket to Paris Photo booked in tandem. The first book being the Vampire book I've been working on and then Alone Together, which is a body of work I've been working on since March of last year. Advertisement  ""I would love to have a solo exhibition in the making somewhere in Los Angeles, where I'll be moving to next month. Also to find an agent to get bigger commercial jobs so I can have more time in between to work on personal projects.""Imdad Barbhuyan""I transitioned from architecture and started making images right at the beginning of 2020. So my journey of exploring photography as a medium — communicating and exchanging thoughts and ideas, all within the bounds of the digital/social media landscape.""So this coming year I wish to be free of that constraint; I wish to engage wholeheartedly with the physical world in a deeper sense — through observation, creation, and dissemination of my work. I have always been a tactile person; I wish to try to explore the physicality of art itself. Returning to creating something tangible is something I really look forward to.""Besides wanting to be able to meet more people in real life, collaborating and creating portraits of individuals, I wish to be able to travel and make images from different places and cultures. I have gotten too comfortable. I want to put myself in unfamiliar situations, push my horizons, and surprise myself."" Advertisement  Hannah Gottlieb-Graham""I recently worked on an incredible project with Google Pixel and SN37 — the fifth edition of Creator Labs, a long-standing partnership and visual arts incubator providing resources to photographers and filmmakers to document personal work grounded in social impact and made on the Google Pixel 6. I’m interested to see how new camera technologies develop in more equitable and inclusive ways for professional photographers and everyday users alike, and this project was a great way for me to start thinking about that resolution.""
 


Cheney Orr""As I write this, I am just coming off a 10-day assignment for Reuters covering the aftermath of the devastating tornadoes that ripped through several US states, focusing much of its fury on Mayfield, Kentucky, where dozens were killed and neighborhoods left unrecognizable. A key photographic goal for 2022 is to continue to follow this community as it strives to find resilience in the face of deeply inflicted trauma and unimaginable loss. These stories are often ignored once a disaster is out of the headlines. Advertisement  ""Another major photo goal is to continue developing a story that looks at how one of America’s most underserved communities is also dealing with one of the nation’s highest rates of Alzheimer’s, a disease that took the life of my own dad. Entering this new year, I want to remind myself to point my camera at my own family, friends, and loved ones. At the end of the day, these are the images that I will forever hold the closest.""
 


Adam Perez""For the past year and a half, I’ve been working on a photo project titled Pandemic in the Heartland, chronicling how the pandemic has devastated California’s Central Valley, which produces one-fourth of our country’s food. My resolution for 2022 is to expand the project into a public art campaign, entitled ""Ve Me"" (See Me), that aims to bring the work back into the community. The idea is to meet the community where they’re at. Many are farmworkers, driving across the region, following the crop season. My plan is to display the photos and quotes on billboards off of Highway 99, a major artery that connects many Central Valley rural communities."" Advertisement  Myrtille Beauvert""More than ever, it’s important to support the wonderful organizations that make photography available to the world through exhibitions, artist discussions, and publications. Whether it’s by being a regular patron or an avid reader or just staying curious about new work being produced, I want to acknowledge and appreciate as much as possible the work of museums, galleries, publishers, and media to champion photography in all its diversity. In 2022, I look forward to supporting meaningful photo projects both privately and professionally!""Hanifa Haris""The tradition of New Year's resolutions is approximately 4000 years old, it's said to have originated among ancient Babylonians. As I sit at my computer on a winter's eve in LA, contemplating my resolutions for next year, my insignificance (as it relates to the history of the world) is not lost on me. As the Creative Director, Head of Photography at Verizon, I'm grateful every day to do the work that I do. I get to work with some of the best creatives in the world and have fun while doing it.""In 2022, I want to commit to harnessing a creative space for discourse while continuing to advocate for equitable storytelling and fostering inclusive environments for artists globally. In the last two years, I've seen, heard, and taken part in a lot of conversations about inclusion, equity, and representation. I'd like to take it further and have discussions about the nuances within this space and the impact on visual culture, image-making, [and how it interacts with] the history of photography and the photography industry at large. For me, 2022 will be focused on actionable impact, both systemic and personal. Personally, I've been developing a couple of projects that I'm excited to share publicly."" Advertisement  
 


Sinna Nasseri""Mainly, I’m getting the itch to hit the road again. After a manic 2020 where I was constantly on the move, 2021 was a lot more stable. I only drove across the country once this year! I miss the feeling of being in motion, forced to make something happen every day. So I guess my main resolution is to put myself into more uncomfortable situations. And also I think it’s time for a long trip to Turkey and Iran to find out about my ancestral homeland.""Polly Irungu""My personal photo resolution this year is to build my archive and document my immediate and external family more frequently. If this pandemic taught us anything, it is that time is precious and limited. Advertisement  ""My second personal resolution is to create a personal project every quarter. I need to carve out more space to photograph the things I deeply care about with no pressure from a client or worrying about algorithms. It's the personal projects that help me remember my 'why.'""My last resolution is to continue building and growing the Black Women Photographers organization — for Black women and nonbinary photographers to be seen, celebrated, and hired — all year round. There is still so much work to be done for us to receive proper equity and inclusion in the industry.""Nolwen Cifuentes""My photo resolution for 2022 is to focus on community. Being a freelancer on top of being in a pandemic can get very isolating at times, and I strongly believe people thrive amongst communities. A big goal of mine in 2022 is to foster a photo community both online and in person. I want to host small (and safe!) gatherings with other photographers, photo editors, stylists, makeup artists — all kinds of folks within the photo industry. Ideally more in real life than online because I think real-life gatherings create deeper bonds. Throughout my career, I’ve been so blessed to have exceptional photo mentors or photographer peers I can call for questions or simply to vent, and I want to continue to expand that.""Celeste Sloman""I am really looking forward to working on more longform bodies of work in 2022, and to being more intentional about my photographic practice. I am really excited to experiment with content and technique and push the boundaries of the work I have been doing up until now. The pandemic has made me crave so many of the communal aspects of the creative process, and I am hoping that we will get a better handle on Covid this year so we can all get back together and make things! I do have a list of collaborations and ideas up my sleeve and I am excited to see how they materialize."" Advertisement  Jamie Lee Taete""I’m a pretty anxious and pessimistic person, but I’m going to make an optimistic resolution to try to put some good energy into the universe. My resolution is to take more intimate photos of people and places. I’ve spent the last couple of years photographing people either outside or indoors under extremely limited conditions (and always while having a low-level panic attack, thinking that I might be infecting people with COVID). I want to take the kinds of photos that you can only get by being close to someone for a prolonged period of time. The kinds that are only possible if COVID goes away. (I’m sure I will look back at this resolution and laugh on Jan. 1, 2023, as I’m changing into a full hazmat suit to go out and take photos amid the virus's 100th extra strength mutation.)""

224,The horror gridlock along both directions of the 50-mile stretch of Interstate 95 was the result of a nightmarish confluence of factors.,"


An “unprecedented” traffic jam amid a foot of snow and icy roads has forced hundreds of motorists to spend the night in their vehicles on Interstate 95 in Virginia between Richmond and Washington, DC.The horror gridlock along both directions of the 50-mile stretch of road was the result of a nightmarish confluence of factors: A winter storm dumped 12 inches of snow in the Fredericksburg area on Monday, freezing temperatures saw the roads turn to ice, trucks and tractor trailers slid and crashed into one another, downed trees turned into yet more roadblocks, and then yet more snow and ice accumulated around the disabled vehicles, making it exceedingly difficult for rescue workers to clear the roads.The chaos ensnared scores of drivers for interminable lengths of time, some of whom were driving home after the holidays, others doing what was supposed to be a quick errand.
 


""I thought I'd just throw the dogs in the car — it's only an hour drive, it should be fine,"" said Susan Phalen, who left for her house in Alexandria from her parents' home in Fredericksburg around 8 p.m. after they lost power there.Phalen said she was without internet when she set out on her journey and wasn't able to see warnings online to avoid the I-95 until it was too late.""The traffic rolled pretty easily around 20 mph for the first 4 or 5 miles, and then it came to an abrupt halt,"" she said.As time dragged on, Phalen began feeling despondent. ""You keep hoping for the best and thinking that any minute the traffic will go, and then the hours wear on,"" she said. ""It just gets frustrating.""
 


Phalen said that while she was able to stay warm by keeping her car idling due to a full tank of gas, she worried for those in the cars around her. If things got worse, she said, she thought she could try to escape on foot with her dogs, but she worried for older drivers or motorists with young children. Advertisement     ""What starts as a frustrating situation turns into a crisis for a lot of people,"" she said.Despondent motorists reported not seeing any state troopers or plows for hours, but Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) officials tried to assure them they were on the case.“We wish we had a timetable, ETA, or an educated guess on when travel will resume on I-95. It's at a standstill in our area with multiple incidents,” VDOT officials wrote on Twitter on Monday night. “It's frustrating & scary. Please know our crews don't stop.”VDOT said it was aware of some drivers who had been stuck on the interstate since Monday morning.“This is unprecedented,” VDOT Fredericksburg District Engineer Marcie Parker said in a statement, “and we continue to steadily move stopped trucks to make progress toward restoring lanes.”
 


Among those stuck was one of the state’s own senators, Tim Kaine, who wrote on Twitter that what should have been a two-hour drive from his home in Virginia to DC had ballooned into 19 hours.NBC News reporter Josh Lederman was another driver forced to spend the night with his dog in the backseat. As day broke, he began doing TV hits live from his stranded vehicle.
 


Gov. Ralph Northam said state officials had worked through the night to try to clear I-95.“​​State and local emergency personnel are continuing to clear downed trees, assist disabled vehicles, and reroute drivers,” Northam said. “An emergency message is going to all stranded drivers connecting them to support, and the state is working with localities to open warming shelters as needed.” Advertisement     Speaking in a Twitter Space for trapped motorists, one man said he survived the night by eating chocolate-covered cherries he had been gifted at Christmas. Another said he had been at a standstill since 11 p.m. just 1 mile from his house but didn’t want to abandon his car despite being frustratingly close to home.“My car was also stuck in the middle of the road. I didn’t know the situation,” he said. “Unless it’s valet, I ain’t leaving it.""It took until late Tuesday afternoon for VDOT to finally announce there were no longer any stranded people. ""Less than 20 vehicles left to be removed from the interstate before plow trains will come through to remove snow and ice from the travel lanes,"" officials said in a tweet.Phalen finally reached her Alexandria home around 16 hours after she had first set out, relieved that she was able to feed her dogs and shower. She was also looking forward to getting some rest after staying awake all night: ""I didn't sleep because I thought that sure enough I'll fall asleep and then the traffic will move and I'll be the one to slow things down.""

225,Tristan Thompson apologized to Khloé Kardashian and said he has the “utmost respect and love” for her after a paternity test proved he’s the father of Maralee Nichols’ child.,"


“I take full responsibility for my actions. Now that a paternity test has been established I look forward to amicably raising our son,” he continued.“I sincerely apologize to everyone I’ve hurt or disappointed throughout this ordeal both publicly and privately,” he added.
 


“My actions certainly have not lined up with the way I view you,” Thompson continued. “I have the utmost respect and love for you. Regardless of what you may think. Again, I am so incredibly sorry.”
 


One quote shared on Instagram on Dec. 31 read: “There’s going to be very painful moments in your life that will change your entire world in a matter of minutes. These moments will change YOU. Let them make you stronger, smarter, and kinder. But don’t you go and become someone that you're not. Cry. Scream if you have to. Then you straighten out that crown and keep it moving.”Another quote posted weeks prior read: “To the woman who believed that this year would be a year of peace and genuine love, I’m sorry that these days, weeks and months have been so unkind to you. I know it may not feel like it at times but you are magic, you are what happens when a dream decides to go to war with nightmares. You are a symbol of strength and survival.”
 


Weighing in to refute the speculation, Kardashian tweeted, “That’s disappointing my face gave that expression. Halle Berry is such a force. Absolutely Stunning and beyond talented.”“I’m barely in my own body right now,” she continued. ""Please don’t read into anything. Also please don’t tear me apart because you assumed something.""
 


Craig also claimed that Thompson had cheated on her — with Kardashian — while she was pregnant with their son in 2016. Both Thompson and Kardashian have since denied the allegation, and instead maintained that the NBA player was single at the time. Advertisement     
 


“Instead of focusing on any negativity, I am choosing to embrace being a mother and doing the best I can for my son,” Nichols told People. “I do not want any further media attention, nor do I want a romantic relationship with [Thompson].”“My goal is to raise our son in a safe, healthy, loving and private environment,” she said.

227,CNN confirmed he will return to host the NYE special again next year.,"Andy Cohen has spoken out after his “stupid and drunk” New Year’s Eve rant on live TV. Andy attracted a lot of attention over the weekend after several comments he made live on CNN while hosting their annual New Year’s Eve Live from Times Square. During the live broadcast on Friday night, Andy and his cohost, Anderson Cooper, kicked off the festivities with several shots of what appeared to be tequila. As the night wore on and the alcohol seemingly took effect, Andy went on to throw shade at a string of public figures, including the likes of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and former NYC mayor Bill de Blasio. However — after admitting in an Instagram post the next morning that he was “a hair over-served” — Andy later confessed that his only regret from the drunken tirade was calling out Ryan Seacrest. In case you missed it, at one point during the show, Andy made a dig at ABC’s competing NYE show, hosted by Ryan — Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve — which was being broadcast simultaneously from elsewhere in Times Square. “There's a bunch of smoke coming from Ryan Seacrest's group of losers that are performing behind us,” Andy told CNN viewers. “If you've been watching ABC tonight, you've seen nothing, I'm sorry,” he added. Recalling the dig on his SiriusXM show three days later, the Bravo mogul admitted that he felt bad about criticizing the ABC broadcast, and by extension, its host. “The only thing that I regret saying, the only thing, is that I slammed the ABC broadcast,” Andy said on Monday. “I really like Ryan Seacrest and he's a great guy and I really regret saying that and I was just stupid and drunk and feeling it.” “I was continuing the Journey rant and I just kept talking and I shouldn't have and I felt bad about that, so that is the only thing,” he added. The host went on to admit that he wasn’t happy about how his comments about Ryan had been taken out of context by the media. “That’s the problem,” he said of the coverage. “The headlines about Ryan Seacrest are all like I trashed Ryan Seacrest and I really … I hope he hears the clip.” And while plenty of viewers were completely loving Andy’s drunken jabs on NYE, others weren’t so taken with the performance, which went on to spark reports that Andy had been fired by CNN as a result. However, it seems that all's well that ends well, as CNN appears to be standing by its host in spite of the backlash. In a new statement provided to BuzzFeed News today, CNN proceeded to shut down reports that Andy had been fired by the network. ""I can confirm that Andy Cohen will be back to co-host NYE on CNN next year,"" a CNN spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. And with that, we're already looking forward to this year's edition!"
228,"The verdict came after a lengthy trial that featured testimony from more than 30 witnesses, including Holmes herself.","


Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, who sought to revolutionize healthcare with a device she claimed could make medical diagnoses using just a fingerprick of blood, has been found guilty of engaging in a multimillion-dollar scheme to defraud investors by making misleading and false statements about the technology’s capabilities.The jury reached the verdict on Monday after deliberating for more than 50 hours over seven days following a lengthy trial that featured testimony from more than 30 witnesses, including former employees, investors, doctors, and patients who used Theranos’s laboratory services. Advertisement     Jurors needed to determine that Holmes intentionally defrauded investors and doctors and patients who used Theranos’s laboratory services in order to convict. The jury decided that Holmes conspired to defraud and defrauded investors, finding her guilty of four counts. She was found not guilty on four charges of conspiring to defraud and defrauding paying patients. The jury could not reach a verdict on three charges.“The jurors in this 15-week trial navigated a complex case amid a pandemic and scheduling obstacles,” US Attorney Stephanie Hinds said in a statement. “I thank the jurors for their thoughtful and determined service that ensured verdicts could be reached. The guilty verdicts in this case reflect Ms. Holmes’ culpability in this large scale investor fraud and she must now face sentencing for her crimes.”Now it will be up to a judge to determine her sentence at a later date. Each guilty count carries a maximum of 20 years in prison, plus a fine of $250,000. Holmes could also be ordered to pay restitution. One of the investment firms she was convicted of defrauding belongs to the DeVos family.Holmes didn't immediately react to the verdict as it was read, according to reporters in the courthouse.Holmes will likely receive a sentence that’s much shorter than what the law allows because she is a mother with a young child and does not have a criminal history, Diane Birnholz, a former federal prosecutor and lecturer in law at the UCLA School of Law, told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement     A Stanford University dropout who was once hailed as the next Steve Jobs, Holmes, 37, captivated investors — and the public — with her vision to make critical lab tests more accessible so that, as she famously repeated in interviews and appearances, “less people have to say goodbye too soon to people they love.”The device that Theranos developed was supposedly faster, cheaper, and more accurate than all other lab equipment on the market and capable of running hundreds of tests on just a few drops of blood. But as a Wall Street Journal investigation revealed in 2015, in reality, the machine, which was much smaller than other blood analyzers, could run only a small number of the tests, and its results were rife with inaccuracies. Instead, Theranos relied on commercially available machines to run most of its tests, diluting the drops of blood to increase volume for some tests and using much larger samples drawn from patients’ arms for others.The company eventually dissolved in 2018 after the Department of Justice indicted Holmes and her ex-boyfriend, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, who was Theranos’s president and chief operating officer, on two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud each. Balwani is set to face a separate trial this year.The case had drawn fascination among people who watched the very public rise and fall of Holmes, whose deep voice, unflinching stare, and uniform of black turtlenecks and red lipstick were captured in a variety of promotional materials and interviews, as well as in documentaries and podcasts. A scripted series featuring actor Amanda Seyfried is in the works, as is a movie starring Jennifer Lawrence. At the core of many of these projects are similar questions: How far should a Silicon Valley startup go as it seeks to disrupt an industry? How could so many wealthy, powerful people buy into a failing business? And was Holmes a delusional dreamer or simply a person running a scam?
 


“Whether or not there are guilty or not guilty verdicts in this case, hopefully the federal indictment and trial have already sent a message to other executives and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to be careful not to make material misrepresentations to potential investors and customers,” Birnholz said. “What matters is what’s true at the time you say something, not what you hope to be true in the future.”During the trial, prosecutors used emails, text messages, documents, audio recordings, and video clips of Holmes speaking in interviews, along with testimony from more than two dozen witnesses, to argue that she was clearly aware of problems with the company’s technology and still lied about its capabilities to get money. Prosecutors also told jurors Holmes lied about the company’s work with the military and pharmaceutical giants to entice potential investors and business partners to finance its operations.“The real version of Theranos, where the defendant went to work every day, was dramatically different than the rosy picture that she was painting for others,” Assistant US Attorney John Bostic told jurors. “The disease that plagued Theranos wasn’t a lack of effort. It was a lack of honesty.”During their deliberations, jurors asked to relisten to a key piece of evidence for prosecutors: the recording of a call Holmes had with investigators in 2013 in which she talked about the capabilities of the company’s technology, its work with pharmaceutical companies, the military, and retail partners, like Walgreens. During the call, which was secretly recorded by one of the investors Holmes was accused of defrauding, the former CEO said Theranos was focused on “work in the Middle East and specifically Afghanistan,” as she talked about “the potential to change survival rates” overseas by putting the company’s testing devices on military helicopters.“Military is a big deal for us,” Holmes told investors during the call. “We’ve been doing a lot of work there. We’ve also been doing a lot of work for Special Operations Command in the context of missions in remote areas.” Advertisement     Several investors testified that they came away from this call with the understanding that the military was actively using Theranos devices. But the company’s equipment was never deployed in medical helicopters or on the battlefield, Holmes confirmed in her own testimony, even as she disputed that she had ever told anyone that.During closing arguments, Holmes’ attorney Kevin Downey focused on Holmes' use of the word “potential” while discussing the company’s military work in this call and in other conversations, telling jurors, “She never says Theranos devices are currently being used.”Why then, Bostic asked jurors to consider, did investors, board members, and journalists leave those conversations with the understanding that she was talking about Theranos’s present-day capabilities?Throughout the trial, Holmes’ legal team portrayed the former CEO as a businessperson who worked diligently for years to make lab testing cheaper and more accessible. And despite admitting that she had made several mistakes along the way — and ultimately failed to disrupt healthcare as she set out to do — Holmes testified that she believed her company’s technology worked.“She believed in this technology, she stayed the whole time, and she went down with that ship when it went down,” Downey said during closing arguments.Over the course of seven days, Holmes, whose downfall attracted intense media coverage and public scrutiny, denied that she’d ever tried to mislead anyone, expressed regrets, deflected blame for the company’s problems, and said that Balwani had psychologically and sexually abused her during their decadelong relationship — claims that he denies.But prosecutors told jurors that the issue of whether she was truly a victim of abuse was separate from her actions as CEO.

229,"""I’m sure I will look back at this resolution and laugh on Jan. 1, 2023, as I’m changing into a full hazmat suit to go out and take photos amid the virus's 100th extra strength mutation.""","


2021 started off in uncertainty, with a dash of chaos, and most of us just strapped in and went along for the ride. In 2022, we’re hoping for better days ahead. No matter your stance on resolutions, the beginning of a year is a good time to check in and make some plans. We talked to some of our favorite photographers about their photo resolutions for 2022 — for the record, mine is to finally put down my mom’s camera from the ’70s and try a few new things.
 


DeSean McClinton-Holland""I’m surprised at how difficult it was for me to answer this question. With COVID spreading and businesses changing how they operate once again, it was hard to see a year that could be as productive or life-changing as this year was for me. Then a friend showed me Hello Future by Farah Al-Qasimi. That changed everything. Not only did it remind me of how much fun it is to make work with the people and objects around me, it also made me think of all the amazing work and books created during the height of the pandemic. With that in mind, I’m now inspired and hopeful that no matter what 2022 brings, anything is possible as long as I’m focused (and fearless)."" Advertisement  Gabriella Angotti-Jones""My resolution for this next year is to continue making photos that reflect my personal history. This past year I really tried to take a step back from doing quick-hit daily assignments to focus on longer-term work that represented my own life and interests. I realized that a lot of my visual vocabulary is informed by my relationships and childhood growing up at the beach. I want to continue figuring out how this influences what I see and the kinds of photos I like to make. I want to get to know more nuanced emotions within myself so I can recognize that in the things and people I photograph. It’s cool because I feel like this is an ever-evolving thing and that this will always be something I get to explore.""Yael Malka""I don’t believe in making resolutions for the new year, because they are almost always a letdown. Resolutions like that put too much pressure on making big transformations, so I prefer to make goals in a more organic way throughout the year. Advertisement  ""Something I have been working on this year and will continue to move towards in the new year is balance — perhaps that will be a lifelong feat? I want more balance between making my own work and making the work I get paid for. I want more balance between working and taking time for myself and not feeling guilty about it. I want to get better at remembering that productivity does not just come in the form of working, but also in relaxing, learning, and feeling joyful. Of course I also want to shoot really cool stories that I care about deeply and make tons of new work and exhibit it, but I also want to remember the importance of having those in-between moments — a lot of times that’s where the best ideas come out for me.""
 


Devin Yalkin""I'd love to have two books finished by the end of next year with a plane ticket to Paris Photo booked in tandem. The first book being the Vampire book I've been working on and then Alone Together, which is a body of work I've been working on since March of last year. Advertisement  ""I would love to have a solo exhibition in the making somewhere in Los Angeles, where I'll be moving to next month. Also to find an agent to get bigger commercial jobs so I can have more time in between to work on personal projects.""Imdad Barbhuyan""I transitioned from architecture and started making images right at the beginning of 2020. So my journey of exploring photography as a medium — communicating and exchanging thoughts and ideas, all within the bounds of the digital/social media landscape.""So this coming year I wish to be free of that constraint; I wish to engage wholeheartedly with the physical world in a deeper sense — through observation, creation, and dissemination of my work. I have always been a tactile person; I wish to try to explore the physicality of art itself. Returning to creating something tangible is something I really look forward to.""Besides wanting to be able to meet more people in real life, collaborating and creating portraits of individuals, I wish to be able to travel and make images from different places and cultures. I have gotten too comfortable. I want to put myself in unfamiliar situations, push my horizons, and surprise myself."" Advertisement  Hannah Gottlieb-Graham""I recently worked on an incredible project with Google Pixel and SN37 — the fifth edition of Creator Labs, a long-standing partnership and visual arts incubator providing resources to photographers and filmmakers to document personal work grounded in social impact and made on the Google Pixel 6. I’m interested to see how new camera technologies develop in more equitable and inclusive ways for professional photographers and everyday users alike, and this project was a great way for me to start thinking about that resolution.""
 


Cheney Orr""As I write this, I am just coming off a 10-day assignment for Reuters covering the aftermath of the devastating tornadoes that ripped through several US states, focusing much of its fury on Mayfield, Kentucky, where dozens were killed and neighborhoods left unrecognizable. A key photographic goal for 2022 is to continue to follow this community as it strives to find resilience in the face of deeply inflicted trauma and unimaginable loss. These stories are often ignored once a disaster is out of the headlines. Advertisement  ""Another major photo goal is to continue developing a story that looks at how one of America’s most underserved communities is also dealing with one of the nation’s highest rates of Alzheimer’s, a disease that took the life of my own dad. Entering this new year, I want to remind myself to point my camera at my own family, friends, and loved ones. At the end of the day, these are the images that I will forever hold the closest.""
 


Adam Perez""For the past year and a half, I’ve been working on a photo project titled Pandemic in the Heartland, chronicling how the pandemic has devastated California’s Central Valley, which produces one-fourth of our country’s food. My resolution for 2022 is to expand the project into a public art campaign, entitled ""Ve Me"" (See Me), that aims to bring the work back into the community. The idea is to meet the community where they’re at. Many are farmworkers, driving across the region, following the crop season. My plan is to display the photos and quotes on billboards off of Highway 99, a major artery that connects many Central Valley rural communities."" Advertisement  Myrtille Beauvert""More than ever, it’s important to support the wonderful organizations that make photography available to the world through exhibitions, artist discussions, and publications. Whether it’s by being a regular patron or an avid reader or just staying curious about new work being produced, I want to acknowledge and appreciate as much as possible the work of museums, galleries, publishers, and media to champion photography in all its diversity. In 2022, I look forward to supporting meaningful photo projects both privately and professionally!""Hanifa Haris""The tradition of New Year's resolutions is approximately 4000 years old, it's said to have originated among ancient Babylonians. As I sit at my computer on a winter's eve in LA, contemplating my resolutions for next year, my insignificance (as it relates to the history of the world) is not lost on me. As the Creative Director, Head of Photography at Verizon, I'm grateful every day to do the work that I do. I get to work with some of the best creatives in the world and have fun while doing it.""In 2022, I want to commit to harnessing a creative space for discourse while continuing to advocate for equitable storytelling and fostering inclusive environments for artists globally. In the last two years, I've seen, heard, and taken part in a lot of conversations about inclusion, equity, and representation. I'd like to take it further and have discussions about the nuances within this space and the impact on visual culture, image-making, [and how it interacts with] the history of photography and the photography industry at large. For me, 2022 will be focused on actionable impact, both systemic and personal. Personally, I've been developing a couple of projects that I'm excited to share publicly."" Advertisement  
 


Sinna Nasseri""Mainly, I’m getting the itch to hit the road again. After a manic 2020 where I was constantly on the move, 2021 was a lot more stable. I only drove across the country once this year! I miss the feeling of being in motion, forced to make something happen every day. So I guess my main resolution is to put myself into more uncomfortable situations. And also I think it’s time for a long trip to Turkey and Iran to find out about my ancestral homeland.""Polly Irungu""My personal photo resolution this year is to build my archive and document my immediate and external family more frequently. If this pandemic taught us anything, it is that time is precious and limited. Advertisement  ""My second personal resolution is to create a personal project every quarter. I need to carve out more space to photograph the things I deeply care about with no pressure from a client or worrying about algorithms. It's the personal projects that help me remember my 'why.'""My last resolution is to continue building and growing the Black Women Photographers organization — for Black women and nonbinary photographers to be seen, celebrated, and hired — all year round. There is still so much work to be done for us to receive proper equity and inclusion in the industry.""Nolwen Cifuentes""My photo resolution for 2022 is to focus on community. Being a freelancer on top of being in a pandemic can get very isolating at times, and I strongly believe people thrive amongst communities. A big goal of mine in 2022 is to foster a photo community both online and in person. I want to host small (and safe!) gatherings with other photographers, photo editors, stylists, makeup artists — all kinds of folks within the photo industry. Ideally more in real life than online because I think real-life gatherings create deeper bonds. Throughout my career, I’ve been so blessed to have exceptional photo mentors or photographer peers I can call for questions or simply to vent, and I want to continue to expand that.""Celeste Sloman""I am really looking forward to working on more longform bodies of work in 2022, and to being more intentional about my photographic practice. I am really excited to experiment with content and technique and push the boundaries of the work I have been doing up until now. The pandemic has made me crave so many of the communal aspects of the creative process, and I am hoping that we will get a better handle on Covid this year so we can all get back together and make things! I do have a list of collaborations and ideas up my sleeve and I am excited to see how they materialize."" Advertisement  Jamie Lee Taete""I’m a pretty anxious and pessimistic person, but I’m going to make an optimistic resolution to try to put some good energy into the universe. My resolution is to take more intimate photos of people and places. I’ve spent the last couple of years photographing people either outside or indoors under extremely limited conditions (and always while having a low-level panic attack, thinking that I might be infecting people with COVID). I want to take the kinds of photos that you can only get by being close to someone for a prolonged period of time. The kinds that are only possible if COVID goes away. (I’m sure I will look back at this resolution and laugh on Jan. 1, 2023, as I’m changing into a full hazmat suit to go out and take photos amid the virus's 100th extra strength mutation.)""

230,"“In a few places there’s still smoldering debris and smoke partially covered by snow,” Gov. Jared Polis said. “It’s really an odd and disturbing juxtaposition.”","


At least two people are still missing, presumed dead, and almost 1,000 homes and other structures were destroyed after a fast-moving wildfire swept through suburban areas northwest of Denver, Colorado officials said Sunday.The blazes sparked on Thursday destroyed some 991 structures and damaged 127 others in the town of Superior and city of Louisville, as well as unincorporated Boulder County.Entire neighborhoods were burned to the ground, with federal officials touring the area Sunday to see the damage for themselves, including scores of burned-out vehicles, some abandoned in the middle of the road by people fleeing. “The pictures that I was seeing on the television before today don’t even come close to what you see when you look at it in person — the amount of devastation,” FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told reporters at a press briefing. Advertisement     The fires burned more than 6,000 acres, whipped by wind gusts of over 105 mph that propelled them through abnormally dry conditions in the area.But in surreal scenes that reflected the wild environmental conditions, 8 inches of snow began falling in the area Friday, ultimately helping to extinguish the blazes.“The snow is an awesome thing for fire behavior,” Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said Saturday, “and it’s a hard thing for crime scene and recovery efforts and damage assessments and all those things. So it’s a mixed blessing.”“In a few places, there’s still smoldering debris and smoke partially covered by snow,” Gov. Jared Polis said Sunday. “It’s really an odd and disturbing juxtaposition.”There had been no fatalities reported in the immediate aftermath of the fires, but officials now say at least two people whose homes were destroyed are missing. A third person who had been missing Saturday has since been accounted for.“We’re very fortunate that we don’t have a list of 100 people missing,” Pelle said.Officials were set to use cadaver dogs to try to locate the individuals’ bodies, but the conditions were still extremely dangerous for recovery workers.“The debris is hot, it’s all fallen in, and it’s now covered with 8 inches of snow, so search and recovery efforts are hampered substantially,” Pelle said.
 


Local officials originally suspected downed power lines had sparked the blazes, but that, too, has changed, according to Pelle.Investigators have not found any credible evidence of any such downed lines. Instead, they have mounted what Pelle described as a “very active investigation” into other possible causes.Acting on a tip, authorities executed a search warrant on one property, but the sheriff declined at this stage to identify it.However, he did say that a viral video of what appeared to be a barn on fire was part of the investigation.Jennifer Balch, a fire scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, told the Denver Post the fires were exacerbated by a climate change–related dry spell that had turned grassland into highly flammable kindling.“Climate change is definitely a part of this story in that fire seasons are longer,” Balch said. “We don’t have a season any longer. We are now looking at yearlong fires.""Weather disasters are inextricably linked to human-induced climate change. The planet has already warmed 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, according to NASA, and that’s making disasters worse. Wildfire seasons are getting longer. Hurricanes are getting wetter and more dangerous. Heat waves are getting hotter, more frequent, and longer-lasting. Heavier rainfall across the US is triggering more inland flooding. And the cost of climate disasters is soaring. Stopping this vicious circle will require drastically reducing our reliance on climate-polluting fossil fuels. Advertisement     Local, state, and federal officials are on the ground in Colorado to assist people in finding housing and dealing with insurance companies, but Polis said many residents are still in shock.“For many, it seems like a surreal experience,” he said. “Just a few days ago, you were celebrating Christmas at home and hanging your stockings, and now home and hearth have been destroyed, and it’s a shock. The reality, I know, hasn’t even set in for so many folks who’ve lost everything.”

231,Anthony Fauci says the CDC is aware of recent pushback to its changes to isolation guidelines and may soon alter them.,"


US health officials may again revise guidelines that recently shortened the isolation period for asymptomatic people with COVID-19 to recommend that they test negative for the virus, the White House’s top medical adviser said Sunday.The guidance released by the CDC last week halved the number of days that people infected with the coronavirus who are not exhibiting symptoms need to isolate themselves from 10 to five, followed by five days of wearing a “well-fitting” mask in public. Advertisement     But scientists told BuzzFeed News they were surprised and alarmed there was no recommendation that people produce a negative test prior to reentering public life. Some speculated it was because many Americans were struggling to obtain rapid antigen tests.“There has been some concern about why we don’t ask people at that five-day period to get tested. That is something that is now under consideration,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony Fauci said in an interview Sunday on ABC’s This Week. “The CDC is very well aware that there has been some pushback about that.”He added, “Looking at it again, there may be an option in that — that testing could be a part of that — and I think we’re going to be hearing more about that in the next day or so from the CDC.”
 


Fauci’s comments suggest something of a reversal for the CDC and the White House, which had previously defended the lack of a testing requirement.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters last week that the organization did not recommend a negative antigen test before ending isolation because the results, positive or negative, do not definitively show whether someone is still infectious.“On the other hand, we know that after five days, people are much less likely to transmit the virus, and that masking further reduces that risk,” Walensky said.Officials said that with hundreds of thousands of Americans testing positive each day as the highly contagious Omicron variant sweeps the US, the shorter isolation period for asymptomatic individuals was necessary to keep the country running.“Obviously, if you have symptoms, you should not be out,” Fauci told CNN last week. “But if you are asymptomatic and you are infected, we want to get people back to the jobs, particularly those with essential jobs, to keep our society running smoothly, so I think that was a very prudent and good choice on the part of the CDC.”
 


In his interview Sunday, Fauci said there was accumulating evidence that the Omicron variant leads to less serious infection and illness, especially in vaccinated individuals, but officials are still concerned that hospitals may be overwhelmed.Because of Omicron’s infectiousness, record numbers of Americans are testing positive. But Fauci said the US should shift its primary focus away from case numbers to hospitalizations.“I’m still very concerned about the tens of millions of people who are not vaccinated at all, because even though many of them are going to get asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, a fair number of them are going to get severe disease,” Fauci said.

232,Greene is the first member of Congress to have her personal political account banned from Twitter.,"


Twitter permanently blocked the personal account of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Sunday for her repeated violations of the website’s policies on COVID-19 misinformation.“We’ve been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy,” a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement to BuzzFeed News.The suspension was prompted by a tweet Greene authored on New Year’s Day in which she called COVID vaccines “dangerous” and falsely said that “extremely high amounts of covid vaccine deaths are ignored.”It was her fifth such violation of the misinformation policy. Under Twitter’s rules, her previous violations caused her to lose access to the account for between 12 hours and seven days.Her previous false tweets said, among other things, that the vaccines were “failing” and that COVID was dangerous only to people who are obese or over 65.Greene’s account had more than 465,000 followers at the time of its suspension.The Georgia Republican is not technically banned from Twitter, since she will still have access to the account for her congressional office, @RepMTG.But that account, which has more than 387,000 followers, could be banned if Greene uses it to violate Twitter’s rules.It is customary for US lawmakers to maintain separate accounts on social media because they are prohibited from fundraising and other campaign activities on their official government channels.In a defiant message posted on Telegram after her suspension, Greene said, ""Twitter is an enemy to America and can't handle the truth.""Greene is the first member of Congress to have her personal political account banned from Twitter.Former president Donald Trump was banned from the platform almost a year ago following the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”Greene, who has supported Qanon and trafficked in nonsensical and racist conspiracies, has been one of the loudest voices in her party spreading misinformation during the pandemic.But she is not alone among the GOP.On Friday, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee deleted a tweet from their official account that falsely said booster shots don’t work.According to scientists and medical authorities, COVID vaccines are safe and effective at preventing serious illness, even against more contagious variants, such as Omicron and Delta.The vaccines have been rigorously tested and are now under the most intense safety monitoring in US history, according to the CDC.More than 4.5 billion people around the world have received a dose.

233,"Marvel movies never really deal with what it means for the world to end – but maybe that’s not so different from what it's like to live through surreal, unbelievable events.","


Here’s a cheerful holiday question, as we enter the third year of a once-a-century pandemic: What does it feel like to live through the world ending?This is — if you really, really zoom out — the question that occupies the aggregate Marvel Cinematic Universe. I’m not saying this is why everyone sees Marvel movies. Obviously not. They make money for the normal reasons of being entertaining, with some of the best and most charismatic actors in large-scale, interlocking adventure stories that occasionally elevate into greatness; they are without pretension and with the natural pull of superheroes (having a favorite). They are a good time. Advertisement  What I am saying, however, is that a real depth of the MCU derives, paradoxically, from a hollowness at its core: It's a series about the world ending via surreal external forces that never really deals with what it means for the world to end.I’ve been thinking about this for three reasons: a. The pandemic just won’t end, b. I have somehow seen six of the nine Marvel properties released in 2021, including Eternals, c. I happened to catch some of Iron Man recently.At the time of release, the original Iron Man was a true product of the George W. Bush years. In 2008, the film's sunshine wittiness and rejection of defense-contractor WMDs sat against the dominant superhero series of that era: Christopher Nolan's Batman. On some level, The Dark Knight, also released in 2008, concerns how far Americans should go to eradicate terrorism and what happens to those who do and why anyone would pursue that at all — a more realist (in presentation), more violent venture into the soul, where you might see a tattered American flag waving in the early morning sun. Rather than bleak, Iron Man is fun. Advertisement  Thirteen long, long years later, Iron Man — if you watch it right now — loses all that Bush-era context and gains a different one. If that exact movie were released today, given all that’s come since within the constructed MCU and in the unfolding trajectory of our real lives, you'd almost expect arch title cards at the beginning: “This was back before the aliens started invading and half the world's population disappeared for five years.” Back when things were messed up, back before they got REALLY messed up, possibly where it all began. It’s a much simpler, more contained movie, where the problems are entirely man-made and direct. Aliens don’t invade; people aren’t forced to kill each other or themselves to protect humanity; there isn’t even that much of a mysterious next property to set up yet.
 


Because Marvel has decided (so far) against completely rebooting existing properties under the Disney banner, the shows and films have begun to acknowledge how weird and extreme the last 10 years of the parallel Marvel world was.The latest Disney+ title, Hawkeye, opens with an 11-year-old girl — Kate Bishop (eventually Hailee Steinfeld) — watching aliens destroy her family’s penthouse and kill her father in 2012, i.e., a scene from the first Avengers movie, from a spectator’s perspective. These touches are usually more comic than anything: In that series’ present day, Hawkeye eyes “Thanos Was Right” graffiti, and catches a terrible musical rendition of the Avengers history. In Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Shaun (Simu Liu) walks past flyers advertising help coping with the blip: “POST-BLIP ANXIETY? YOU ARE NOT ALONE.” His college friend tells him, basically, it's time to grow up because you never know when half of humanity, including you, might disappear again.The more surface touches of this, though, weirdly, are reminiscent of the surface touches of the pandemic. The New York subways remain plastered, for instance, with an ad advising proper mask-wearing, featuring a consistent black-ink cartoon style against a rich gold-yellow backdrop. These cartoon characters started in summer 2020; they got winter clothes toward Christmas last year; they started reminding you to wear a mask even if you're vaccinated in the spring; now they remind you to wear a mask, ask you to read or look at your phone instead of talking, and get a booster vaccine (""Need a boost?""). Staring at one while on your way to the dentist has that same sort of surrealist humdrum irony touch. Advertisement  
 


Nothing deals with the preceding decade of the MCU without really dealing with the decade more than Spider-Man: Far From Home. That movie opens with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) arguing about how not every catastrophe is aliens, the catastrophe apparently being aliens, then a segue into a meme-looking high school PA in memoriam of fallen Avengers set to “I Will Always Love You,” and a recap of people returning from the blip with a lament that people had to take midterms and a returned marching band member getting hit in the face with a basketball. Shortly thereafter, Spider-Man and a joking Aunt May do a Salvation Army fundraiser for everyone in New York displaced from their homes by their own disappearance. Now Far From Home rules (many Spider-Mans converge on Spider-Man in a trippy virtual reality), and arguably a jokiness fits both Spider-Man and the overall realm of high school, but it does not per se encompass all the emotions that might follow half the earth’s population atomizing temporarily. Advertisement  Elsewhere in Phase Four of the MCU, this occasionally goes deeper, if briefly, like the suggestion of Kate Bishop’s origin story. WandaVision features Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) waking up from the blip in a cancer ward to find her mother died a long time ago; the hospital is total chaos. Hawkeye opens one episode with Florence Pugh’s Yelena stepping into a powder room and seeing herself disappear and reemerge in the blip, with the walls changing color around her as time jumps ahead five years. When she exits, her old friend has a husband and a child. The overall effect in 2021 is: Oh damn, it’s like the pandemic.What they aren’t really doing is dealing too much with how everyone keeps living their lives — on any deeper, presumably more emotionally chaotic level — despite the actual mass death, destruction, and resurrection that the Marvel world puts forward. The story stays pretty contained to a few dozen heroes; absolution is usually not too hard to achieve; the next thing is always coming, and whatever it is, it will follow the rhythms of the first thing. We all know to expect the last 15 to 30 minutes of a Marvel enterprise to be consumed by a CGI fight in the air with aliens/robots/dragons/witches (so much so that Spider-Man: Far From Home’s villain operates on that expectation) intermingled with some forward-looking irresolution. Even with (fun!) characters like Kate Bishop, Marvel doesn’t really delve too deeply into how and why the collapsing earth resulted in a wealthy 22-year-old beating up mafia bros (beyond a dope opening credits sequence).WandaVision, for instance, tells a very specific, deep Twilight Zone story about how the mind can try to rewrite a brutal, shocking loss. But when the narrative ventures toward how that kind of grief — no matter how real — can inflict pain on other people, the show backs away from dealing with the implications of what Marvel’s heroes wrought, in favor of the next thing (promoting Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange). Which is, actually, mostly fine; not everything must be The Leftovers or Crime and Punishment, and WandaVision offered plenty of compelling cuts of a life undone. And Spider-Man: Far From Home is fun as hell and they shouldn’t have changed anything about it. Advertisement  
 


The more I’ve thought about this eternal setup at the expense of the current thing, though, it’s seemed to me almost like an accidental depth, one that speaks to the last decade, in which it’s occasionally felt like the world is ending — or at least becoming complicated beyond previous recognition. And I wouldn’t exactly say this fundamental feature of the MCU makes most of these titles excellent art on the individual level about what it feels like for the world to feel like it’s ending.But taken together, at the 100,000-foot level, the fact that each property is basically about someone doing what they were doing anyway, then having to deal with some new iteration of surreal but familiar external forces invading, and never having any time to really think about what it all means because the next thing is already happening, as it turns out — now that we really do live in a notable historical period of continual surreal events that could make you question the foundations of society — everyone has to continue doing what they were doing anyway when the world is ending, and you’ll never have that much time to think about what it all means because the demands of the next thing will be upon you.What does it feel like when the world ends? It just feels like aliens invading until something else happens. ●

235,"They say agent Jayson Chambers business, Exeintel,created a potential “conflict of interest” in the investigation of their clients, who are accused of plotting to kidnap the state’s governor.","


A private intelligence business owned by a lead FBI agent in the Michigan kidnapping case may have tainted the “good faith and integrity of the investigation,” defense attorneys are arguing in a new court filing.The agent, Jayson Chambers, was the primary handler for a confidential informant who infiltrated the armed militant group Wolverine Watchmen and who played a central role in building the case that they allegedly plotted to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. In August, BuzzFeed News revealed that Chambers had registered a business called Exeintel that was linked to an internet troll who appeared to have tweeted about the case before it became public. Advertisement     
 


Earlier this month, prosecutors said that the government would not be calling on Chambers to testify at the federal trial in the case, slated to begin March 8, and that discussion of the agent’s “extrinsic” business should not be permitted — even if defense attorneys call him as a witness. But in their Friday filing, attorneys for all five federal defendants facing trial claim that Exeintel is relevant because it represents an “apparent conflict of interest” and they should be permitted to explore the topic at trial.In materials circulated in 2019 to promote Exeintel, Chambers cited his casework with the FBI, which the defense lawyers said proves he “was attempting to leverage his success in criminal investigations performed for the FBI for his personal profit.” By extension, they claim, it’s possible that Chambers had financial motivation for the kidnapping investigation to result in arrests — and that could explain behavior by the agent they characterize as an attempt to entrap their clients.The government charged six men with conspiring to kidnap the sitting governor in October 2020. One subsequently pleaded guilty, while five others — Brandon Caserta, Barry Croft, Adam Fox, Kaleb Franks, and Daniel Harris — maintain their innocence and claim the government “initiated” and directed the entire conspiracy. Last week, they asked for the indictment to be dismissed because of “egregious overreaching” by the government, which employed at least a dozen confidential informants during the probe.Federal prosecutors have denied those allegations, claiming the men were predisposed to commit the crimes. The Michigan attorney general's office has similarly defended its case against eight additional men who were charged with providing material support to terrorism.To underscore their theory of predisposition, prosecutors are seeking to admit evidence of prior criminal activity by several of the defendants, including two convictions by Croft in the 1990s and one by Franks in 2013. In new filings, defense attorneys say the government “mischaracterizes” the offenses to make them appear more serious, but in fact they bear “no resemblance to the charged offense” and thus have “no value with regard to showing propensity.” An attorney for Croft also noted that he was fully pardoned by the governor of Delaware for both of those convictions in 2018.A spokesperson for the FBI referred a request for comment to the Justice Department. A spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Michigan did not immediately respond to a request for comment but has previously declined to discuss the kidnapping case. Jayson Chambers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A particular challenge for prosecutors in what is arguably the highest-profile domestic terrorism case in the country — other than those related to the Capitol insurrection — has been the conduct of the FBI agents in the probe.One agent, Richard Trask, who was held out as the public face of the case, was fired after being charged with beating his wife in July. A second agent, Henrik Impola, has been accused of perjury in a different case, and in a filing Friday, defense attorneys asked the court’s permission to question him on the stand about that allegation, which prosecutors have termed “unfounded.”According to evidence shared by the government and cited by defense lawyers in their filing, Chambers may have played a far more important role in the case than the other two. Records show he wrote 227 reports on contacts with the confidential informant known as “Dan,” compared with just five written by Impola and zero by Trask.Dan, court testimony shows, helped initiate the case in March 2020 and made hundreds of hours of clandestine recordings of the defendants, accompanying them on trips to meetings and training exercises and often paying for their travel expenses. A text message sent by Chambers to Dan in September 2020 stated, “Mission is to kill the governor specifically.”The FBI has declined to state whether Chambers sought permission from the bureau to register a business while still working full time as an agent. Prosecutors have said that he never made any money from Exeintel and that he abandoned plans to quit the FBI. But public records show that Chambers did not formally dissolve his company until Oct. 29 of this year, “meaning he owned the company throughout the entire investigation of the alleged plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer,” defense attorneys wrote Friday.

236,"From the insurrection to AAVE, here's how we thought about language in 2021 ","


This is an excerpt from Quibbles & Bits, the BuzzFeed News copy desk’s newsletter. Sign up below to nerd out about language and style with us once a month!
 


It’s been a long year! 2021 has led the BuzzFeed copy desk in new directions and presented us with new predicaments about how to use language in the news. From the very first week of 2021, the events of Jan. 6 forced us to navigate big questions: Is this an insurrection or an attempted coup or a domestic terrorist attack? Did that person steal a podium or a lectern? Are the words “protesters” and “demonstrators” too legitimizing? Can we call it a riot?We will likely be looking back at Jan. 6 and its fallout for the rest of our lives, and news stories will serve as artifacts of how journalists characterized it in real time. The copy desk is always weighing the ramifications of our words and determining what is the most truthful and fair. And as with any semantic discussion in the news world, we need to question whether language we’ve ascribed to an event is obsolete, whether it’s evolved, and whether it accurately fits the situation.In each issue of our Quibbles & Bits newsletter this year, we’ve shared how our copy desk has processed language and given a behind-the-scenes look at BuzzFeed News’ decision-making — and sometimes how other news outlets are working through these topics as well. Advertisement     Here are the discussions we had this year:In March, we debunked eight grammar and language myths you’ve likely been victimized by. These have been taught by generations of schoolteachers, reinforced by old-fashioned style books, and gleefully (but wrongly) championed in Twitter hypercorrections. We implore you to forget them.Two weeks later, we unpacked how something as tiny as a hyphen can have a big impact on language. Inspired by Twitter user @challahbackjew and research from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance and the Anti-Defamation League, we shared our style change on the word antisemitism. The hyphenated form (anti-semitism), we wrote, accentuates the Semitism part and implies the existence of a Semitic race of people, an erroneous notion rooted in Nazi ideology.This summer, we spoke with autistic people about identity-first language versus person-first language. The latter, a mainstay of many newsrooms’ style guides and sensitivity guidelines, has traditionally been used to describe people with disabilities, people experiencing homelessness, or people in jail. But this trend may be receding, as many communities (including autistic, Deaf, blind, and disabled people) now generally opt for identity-first language. “We recognize that disability and personhood are not mutually exclusive; they are not oxymoronic,” Lydia X. Z. Brown told us.In September, we emphasized the need to uncover the origins of modern slang, which is often rooted in African American Vernacular English (AAVE). When we divorce language from its context, we risk further oppressing not only Black people but also the communities they intersect with, including other people of color, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. Black culture is not deserving of mockery or appropriation — it demands respect.Then, in November, we noted that ableist phrasing is ubiquitous in modern language, from clichés to callous analogies that devalue disabled people. Some examples are obvious, like “crippling” or “handicap,” but others are more nuanced and require a perceptive copy editor to think about whether the words are dubious in context.On a different front, we developed some style quizzes (we are the BuzzFeed copy desk; we must contain multitudes). We typically use these to test our colleagues in the newsroom, but we publish them for the readers who are so inclined to take them. Here’s one from July with the theme of TikTok trends, and a supernatural style quiz from October. Advertisement     Finally, don’t miss our favorite year-end traditions: The Best, Worst, and Funniest Corrections and The Best Grammar Memes and Tweets (most of which are from us — what about it? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).What's New?Here are some of the additions and changes we made to the style guide in 2021!ableist terms: added alternatives words to use instead of those that have ableist connotations or make light of disabilities (instead of crippled or handicapped, use hampered, obstructed, or inhibited; instead of tone-deaf, use insensitive, obtuse, or oblivious).Afghan (citizens of Afghanistan), afghani (currency)antisemitism (no hyphen)copy desk (replaced copydesk); copy editor (n.)coronavirus pandemic: Capitalize the Greek alphabet name assigned to a variant by the WHO, e.g., the Omicron variant.disinformation: the intentional spreading of false or misleading information, often for political gain (e.g., a disinformation campaign); misinformation refers to falsehoods more generally, without a specific intentfirst gentleman: like first family and first lady, always lowercase as they’re not formal titles, e.g., first lady Jill Biden (first partner, anyone?)older adults or older person/people: Use these rather than senior citizens, seniors, or elderly.

237,"People with disabilities often must speak up for “dignity of risk”: the right to make choices freely, good and bad. This is Marie's story.","


This is a plain language version of a story published earlier this year, adapted by Sandy Mislow of the Self-Advocacy Association of New York State.
 


Marie Bergum wanted the chance to live her own life — and make her own mistakes. Her father said that could not happen.
 


Marie was in her 30s and had an intellectual disability. As a teenager, she lived a mostly independent life like other teens and took the bus to a job at McDonald’s, where she helped work the cash register. Marie also cooked at home and took care of the dogs.
 


After her parents divorced, her father, Jim, became her legal guardian.
 


Marie did not understand what this meant when she agreed to it, and she later decided she did not want her father to be her legal guardian. (In California, where Marie is from, they call legal guardians ""conservators,"" and guardianships ""conservatorships."")
 


She wanted to learn how to do things like budgeting and making medical decisions instead of her father doing them for her. She said, “I need help with life!” and later said, “But I want them to show me, not do it for me.” Advertisement     
 


Marie worked together with some lawyers and family members who believed she could make her own decisions. She had to be careful that her father did not know about her meetings with them.
 


Sometimes Marie had to be sneaky by calling her supporters from the gym locker room because she felt she had no privacy at home. This was a risk — she said if her dad found out she was on the phone instead of lifting weights, he would call her a liar or follow her the next time she left the house. Marie said if he knew she was trying to fight for freedom to make her own decisions, he might take her phone away from her.
 


Marie’s lawyers told the courts that Jim was controlling her money, not allowing her to have sex with boyfriends, keeping her away from people he didn’t like, verbally abusing her by calling her “stupid” and “fat,” and moving her from city to city without including her in the decision. Marie told court officers that Jim did not allow her to have a lock on her door, take public transportation, cook meals, or choose how much money she could spend each week. “He started saying that I couldn’t do things because I wasn’t that smart,” Marie told BuzzFeed News. “Everything was taken away, a little bit every year.” Advertisement     
 


Jim told BuzzFeed News he loved his daughter, and the world was full of dangers and people looking to take advantage of her. He said, “My job is to protect her and put her on the path that she can succeed as best as she can.” He said his rules stopped her from making mistakes she might later wish she did not make. Jim said that he wanted his daughter to be happy and that being her guardian was the best way to achieve that because she, unfortunately, was not as capable as she thought she was. Jim said many of Marie’s accusations were wrong, but he didn’t take them personally.
 


There are many more stories like Marie’s. People with disabilities often must speak up for “dignity of risk”: the right to make choices freely, good and bad, to learn from and live full lives. Disability rights experts say that everyone, especially young adults, deserves the chance to make mistakes and learn from them. Advertisement     
 


Experts say it can be hard to get freedom from legal guardians who are family members. Many parents of children with disabilities get guardianship as soon as the child turns 18 because schools tell them they should. This is called the “school-to-guardianship pipeline.” Even if parents want to end the guardianship later, it can be hard to do so.
 


There are other options for people with disabilities to get support that do not take away their rights to make decisions. Supported decision-making allows people to choose who will help them make decisions instead of having another person take over the person’s life and make choices for them.
 


Disability rights experts say that supported decision-making can work for many people with disabilities. Researchers learned that when people with disabilities make their own decisions, they are more likely to have jobs and be healthier, happier, and more involved in their communities. Even the National Guardianship Association said supported decision-making is a “promising” measure that “should be considered for the person before guardianship.” Advertisement     
 


Marie filed to end her guardianship in March 2018. She wrote, “My human rights are being violated.” Her father disagreed and told the court, “I hate to say this, but it is a proven truth, that I must not only save Marie from outside predators just waiting for an opportunity, but Marie often requires being saved from herself and her own lack of ability to decide what is healthy and safe for her.” The judge allowed Jim to continue having control over Marie’s life.
 


Soon after, Marie got new lawyers so she could try again to gain her freedom. She created a supported decision-making plan and assigned family members to support her in different parts of her life, such as budgeting, housing, completing job applications, making medical decisions, cooking, making educational plans, and staying safe. This time she won, and the court removed Jim as her guardian.
 


Marie’s Aunt Nancy, together with a program manager from an advocacy center, will be her guardians for one year. Then a judge will decide if Marie can successfully live without a guardian. The court said Jim can never again be Marie’s guardian. “Jim can’t do anything to me anymore,” she said with a wide grin.
 


“Be persistent. Your dreams can come true. Don’t let anyone in your family tell you you can’t do things.”

239,What’s the punishment for storming the Capitol? A BuzzFeed News analysis shows judges are struggling to figure it out.,"


Join HuffPost and BuzzFeed News for a Twitter Spaces conversation about how the Capitol riot is still altering US politics on Jan. 4 at 1 p.m. ET. Sign up to be notified when the Space begins here.
 


WASHINGTON — What is the punishment for someone who admits they joined in on an attack on democracy?For Jordan Stotts of Minnesota, it was two years on probation, with two months of tighter limits on when he can leave home. He scaled a wall to join the breach of the US Capitol, was captured on camera shouting at officers in the rotunda, and vowed to return, posting on Facebook: “Patriots! I got kicked out but I’ll be back!”For Lori and Thomas Vinson of Kentucky, it was five years on probation plus a $5,000 fine. Prosecutors had wanted jail time for Lori — she told an interviewer after she was fired from her job for participating in the riot, “I would do it again tomorrow” — but a judge didn’t agree.For Boyd Camper of Montana, it was two months in jail. As he joined the mob streaming into the building, he filmed his trek on a GoPro. He told a news crew outside later, “We’re going to take this damn place.”The task of fashioning justice for people who admitted to participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection has fallen to 22 judges on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The court’s members — a mix of Democrat and Republican appointees — have made clear they believe the assault on the Capitol was serious and violent, and that people convicted of crimes deserve punishment. They just don’t agree on what it should be. Advertisement  Some judges have bristled that prosecutors struck plea deals for low-level misdemeanors that limit the sentences they can impose. Some have imposed sentences that were harsher than the government’s recommendation; others have been more lenient. Some have questioned the varying sentences proposed by prosecutors across a spectrum of Capitol rioters who pleaded guilty to the same offense.It is “no wonder,” US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell said at an October sentencing, that some people “are confused about whether what happened on Jan. 6 was a petty offense of trespassing or shocking criminal conduct that represented a grave threat to our democratic norms.”Judges have had no patience for Donald Trump supporters trying to use the courthouse as a forum to relitigate President Joe Biden’s win in 2020. But the lack of consensus on the bench about what exactly justice should look like for each person who joined the mob mirrors a lack of consensus nationwide about how to think about the insurrection and its aftermath.The most common sentence has been probation, with a short period of home confinement or a fine mixed in, according to BuzzFeed News’ tracking of every prosecution filed in the year since the Jan. 6 attack. Probation means people can mostly return to their normal lives, with conditions — they have to regularly report to a probation officer, get permission to travel, submit to a home inspection at any time, and hold a job. They can’t have guns or other weapons. Violating probation by committing new crimes or failing to comply with other terms is a standalone crime that can be prosecuted. Advertisement  Nearly all of the 71 defendants sentenced as of the end of December pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, with most deals featuring the same charge: illegally parading in the Capitol, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $5,000 fine.In more than half of these misdemeanor sentencings, judges ordered punishments that were lighter than what the government argued for in terms of jail or home detention. Two-thirds of defendants sentenced for misdemeanor pleas didn’t receive any jail time.If you have more information about Jan. 6 or the legal fights in its aftermath, contact this reporter at zoe.tillman@buzzfeed.com, or see other ways to send tips here.Prosecutors have not charged everyone accused of descending on the Capitol with felonies that reflect the political nature of the overarching criminal event, which temporarily halted Congress’ certification of the election and the peaceful transfer of power. No one has been charged with sedition or insurrection, both rarely brought offenses. A top Justice Department official said early on that sedition was being explored for “the most heinous acts,” along with conspiracy; more than 50 people have been charged with that latter crime.Of the 700-plus people charged so far, BuzzFeed News’ analysis shows that just over half are facing at least one felony. The most common felony count is for obstructing an official proceeding; those cases have tended to involve some specific evidence that defendants were actively trying to disrupt the special session of Congress, such as making it to the floor of the Senate or expressing their intent in interviews or online. The obstruction offense has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, although nonviolent, first-time offenders are likely to face far less than that, and prosecutors have already agreed to let some defendants plead down to a misdemeanor. There are also felony cases pending against people charged with assaulting police, carrying or using weapons, and civil disorder. Advertisement  Everyone else is being hit solely with misdemeanor charges for illegally being in the Capitol, disorderly conduct, and parading, a collection of counts carrying maximum penalties between six months to a year in jail. The US attorney’s office in Washington focused plea offers this year on the less serious cases with lower stakes. It’s a strategy that not only clears cases and frees up resources, but also is in keeping with broader trends across the US justice system, where the overwhelming majority of criminal cases end in plea bargains.This process means that justice for an attack on democracy is filtering through a criminal justice system largely built around agreements that are hammered out in secret between the accused (the rioters) and the accusers (the prosecutors), and sentences crafted by a single judge. The riot was the violent culmination of a monthslong effort led by Trump and his supporters to undo millions of votes cast in a presidential election, but there’s little to no opportunity for public input on the consequences for people who participated.
 


Judges have talked from the bench about the challenge of applying the normal rules to an unprecedented event like Jan. 6. They’ve explained that they have to treat each defendant as an individual and can’t punish them for the full spectrum of criminal activity committed at the Capitol.With most defendants admitting to the same misdemeanors on paper, judges are picking apart the details of their words and actions as compared to other rioters. They’re weighing how those details make a person more or less individually responsible for the threat — potential or actualized — posed by the mob.How many minutes did a defendant spend in the Capitol? Did they walk through a breached door or climb through a broken window? Where did they go? How far inside did they travel? Did they capture photos or video? Did they take selfies, and did they look happy to be there? Did they witness violence or vandalism and keep going? Did they publicly brag about it online, or only send messages to friends and family, and does that distinction matter? Is the remorse they expressed later legitimate or are they just sorry they got caught, and, really, how can anyone know for sure?And the big question that’s loomed over the conclusion of each of these cases: Is there any sentence that could dissuade people from storming the Capitol in January 2025 if they disagree with the results of the next presidential election? Advertisement  For some judges, the obvious answer is jail. In the handful of cases where a defendant has pleaded guilty to a felony like assaulting police or obstructing Congress, judges have imposed months or years of prison. The length of incarceration in misdemeanor cases may be short by comparison, but judges have said they hope the threat of any loss of liberty scares off other people, disappointed or furious when the candidate they supported loses an election, from taking matters into their own hands.US District Judge Tanya Chutkan has emerged as an early proponent of time behind bars for misdemeanor offenders. At a sentencing in early October, she ordered Matthew Mazzocco of Texas to spend 45 days in jail, becoming the first judge to go above the amount of time the government recommended. She chastised Mazzocco for treating the riot like “entertainment” — he’d posted a celebratory selfie in front of the Capitol on Facebook with the caption, “The capital is ours!” and took photos of himself smiling inside and outside the building — and said a harsher sentence was needed as a warning to others.“There have to be consequences for participating in an attempted violent overthrow of the government, beyond sitting at home,” Chutkan said at the time. Advertisement  Other judges aren’t convinced that time behind bars is justified for people pleading guilty to low-level, nonviolent crimes, or if a relatively short stint in jail is even the most effective way to make the punishment “hurt,” in the words of one judge. They’ve crafted sentences featuring combinations of probation, fines, home detention, computer monitoring, social media restrictions, mental health treatment, job training, and community service.With new cases being filed every week, 71 sentences is too small a number to confirm patterns for how the rest of these cases will play out. There’s too little data, for instance, to say whether the political pathways that judges took to the bench manifest in the sentences they hand down. Judges nominated by presidents of both parties, including Trump, have mixed records of ordering jail versus probation for Capitol rioters. But most judges have only presided over a handful of sentencings, and some judges haven’t sentenced anyone yet.Still, enough cases have reached the final phase to understand what judges are thinking about as they mete out justice. They’re aware of the intense media coverage of these cases and the fact that the court allows the public to dial in to hear live audio of most hearings, a pandemic-related expansion of access. They’re keeping an eye on the investigation into Jan. 6 that’s unfolding in Congress, and they’re paying close attention to what their colleagues are doing — sometimes publicly signaling when they agree or disagree with another judge’s decision or comments.There was the case where US District Judge Trevor McFadden accused the Justice Department of not being “even-handed” in its response to Jan. 6 compared to the protests last summer against racism and police brutality — comments that prompted Chutkan in another case to say she disagreed with McFadden, calling it a “false equivalence.” It was one of the few times where the broader political discourse seemed to seep into public exchanges among judges; McFadden was nominated by Trump, Chutkan by former president Barack Obama. There was the case where US District Judge Rudolph Contreras accused prosecutors of ramping up their sentencing recommendations because they were yelled at by another judge. Advertisement  Several judges have expressed concern about the case of Anna Morgan-Lloyd, who made an emotional plea for leniency to US District Judge Royce Lamberth and received probation. Morgan-Lloyd then went on Fox News the day after her sentencing and made comments that seemed to minimize the violence at the Capitol. Morgan-Lloyd’s lawyer has insisted her client got “played” by Fox and was honest with Lamberth, but judges have held up her case as a cautionary tale against giving too much weight to after-the-fact expressions of remorse.Lamberth, meanwhile, has made it known that he felt burned by Morgan-Lloyd. When Frank Scavo of Pennsylvania came before the judge last month after pleading guilty to the same parading misdemeanor, Lamberth blew past the two-week jail sentence that the government argued for, sentencing Scavo to 60 days.A few judges have complained that charging decisions by prosecutors tied their hands in crafting sentences.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson has questioned prosecutors about the wisdom of entering plea deals for a misdemeanor that restricted the options that judges had for ordering extended court supervision. US District Judge Carl Nichols expressed the same concern at a November sentencing for David Mish of Wisconsin, saying he was “very torn” because he thought Mish could benefit from longer-term contact with the court. Nichols ended up sending Mish to jail for 30 days, citing his previous criminal record as well as the need to deter others. Advertisement  
 


It’s not the first time that federal judges in Washington have been faced with novel questions of law with massive implications for the legitimacy of the US government and its institutions. The court has presided over legal entanglements from some of the biggest political scandals in modern history — Watergate, Whitewater and the Clinton affair, the Russia probe — as well as the crush of cases filed by people captured in the War on Terror after 9/11 challenging their indefinite detention at the US military installation in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.The sheer number of Jan. 6 cases sets this prosecution effort apart. A prosecutor recently said in court that the government believed that 2,000 to 2,500 people illegally went inside the Capitol, far more than the estimate of 800 people that a US Capitol Police official gave Congress early on. Prosecutors and Justice Department officials haven’t said if there’s a target number for when they’ll end the investigation. Advertisement  The seven people sentenced for felonies have all received prison time. Paul Hodgkins of Florida, who pleaded guilty to obstructing Congress, had tried to argue for no time behind bars since he hadn’t engaged in violence or destruction; he went onto the Senate floor and carried a “TRUMP” flag. US District Judge Randolph Moss said probation wasn’t an option and ordered him to spend eight months in prison, less than the 18 months sought by prosecutors. It was a benchmark-setting hearing that spelled bad news for any defendant hoping to stay out of prison with a felony plea deal.People needed to know that assaulting the Capitol and interfering with the democratic process “will have severe consequences,” the judge said at the time.Of the 64 people sentenced for a misdemeanor offense, 36 — more than half — received sentences that were lighter than what the government recommended as far as loss of liberty, according to BuzzFeed News’ analysis. That included 14 cases where judges rejected the government’s recommendation of prison time altogether, nine cases where judges ordered a period of incarceration that was shorter than the government’s request, and 13 cases where judges didn’t agree with the government’s recommendation of a short period of home confinement as a condition of probation.
 


Forty defendants who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors — roughly two-thirds — avoided time behind bars, receiving home confinement and probation, or probation alone.The remaining 24 misdemeanor offenders were incarcerated. Nine people received prison sentences that were more severe than what the government requested, with judges either going above the amount of incarceration prosecutors asked for or rejecting a recommendation of probation. Nine people received prison sentences that fell below the government’s recommendation, and six received time behind bars that matched the government’s request.Jail sentences for misdemeanor offenders have ranged from as short as 14 days to as long as six months, although in the two cases to hit that high end the defendants already had been in jail after their arrests and were sentenced to the time they’d served.US District Judge Thomas Hogan ordered Robert Reeder to spend three months in jail, less than the six months prosecutors argued for after new evidence emerged that he’d been involved in a physical confrontation with police. Hogan said he wanted his sentence to signal that other rioters should expect jail time. But he explained that he didn’t think six months was appropriate because Reeder didn’t have a previous criminal record and the judge wasn’t sold that the evidence showed Reeder deliberately struck an officer with his fist. Advertisement     The person-specific facts of each case make it hard to do apples-to-apples comparisons, but some cases feature similar overarching narratives. Russell Peterson of Pennsylvania livestreamed on Facebook — “The Capitol is ours right now,” he said at one point — and prosecutors accused him of downplaying the violence afterward. The government asked for two weeks in jail. Jackson sentenced him to 30 days. Prosecutors wanted 60 days in jail for Glenn Croy of Colorado, arguing he’d entered the Capitol twice, treated the breach like a “vacation” by taking and posing for photos, and sent messages after that disputed the level of violence. Howell sentenced him to three months of home confinement and three years of probation.Howell has used some of the strongest language this year denouncing the insurrection and questioning prosecutors’ decision not to press more serious charges against participants. But in several misdemeanor cases, she’s rejected the government’s jail recommendations, pointing to other cases where prosecutors asked for probation for rioters who pleaded guilty to the same crimes and saying she also had an obligation to avoid “unwarranted” differences. She blasted the government’s “muddled” approach and blamed prosecutors for undercutting their own efforts.Howell’s sentences have included a period of home confinement and probation for Jack Griffith, a Tennessee man who was recorded on video screaming in excitement as he entered the Capitol and whose extensive social media posts afterward suggested a lack of remorse. Prosecutors had asked for three months of incarceration. As part of his sentence, Howell ordered the probation office to monitor his computer activity and barred him from using any social media platforms without getting permission first. Advertisement     Some judges have turned to hitting people’s pockets. In 16 cases, judges ordered defendants to pay fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 as an additional penalty beyond probation or jail; in 13 of those cases, the sentences were otherwise lighter than the government’s recommendation.Fines levied by judges are on top of agreements defendants have made to pay restitution to the US government as part of their plea deals — $500 for a misdemeanor plea, and $1,000 to $2,000 for a felony plea. Between fines ordered by judges and restitution agreements, the 160-plus rioters who have entered guilty pleas owe $148,500, roughly 10% of the nearly $1.5 million that the government has estimated in damage to the Capitol.
 


When US District Judge Reggie Walton sentenced the Vinsons, overruling the government’s request for jail time for Lori Vinson, he explained that one reason for that was he didn’t think the cost of incarcerating her was worth it. He said that he’d rather have the couple contribute toward the cost of repairing the Capitol and jail would only delay their ability to do that. Advertisement     “​​I want the sentence to hurt, because people have to understand that if you do something like this, it’s going to hurt,” Walton said, ordering them each to pay $5,000.Walton took the same approach this month in sentencing Anthony Mariotto of Florida. The prosecutor asked for four months of incarceration, arguing his misdemeanor case was more serious because of how far he’d made it into the building — he posted a selfie on Facebook from the Senate gallery, smiling, with a caption that included, “This is our house” — and the fact that he recorded assaults on police, knocked on doors, and seemed to minimize his role in an interview later.Walton sentenced Mariotto to pay a $5,000 fine and spend three years on probation. The judge said he believed that participating in the insurrection was a serious enough offense to merit incarceration. But he said he also didn’t think it was realistic to try to jail every defendant, and that it wouldn’t be appropriate since other defendants who pleaded guilty to the same crime received probation.Some judges have used the public platform they have at these sentencing hearings to make their feelings about what happened on Jan. 6 known. They’ve emphasized the seriousness of the insurrection, disputed narratives that have sprung up among right-wing politicians and pundits that rioters were “tourists” or that incarcerated defendants are “political prisoners,” and called out some of the bold-face names who haven’t been criminally charged — Trump and his allies who promoted the lie that the 2020 election was stolen (and continue to do so). Advertisement     When US District Judge Rudolph Contreras earlier this month rejected the government’s request for jail time for Felipe Marquez of Florida, the judge explained that he believed Marquez would be better served by home confinement and probation, plus a set of additional conditions including mental health treatment, job training, and other support. The judge said that Jan. 6 was the result of an “unprecedented” series of events, spurred on by Trump and his allies who “bear much responsibility” for what happened.At a sentencing in November, US District Judge Amit Mehta said that defendant John Lolos of Washington state was “a pawn in a game that’s played and directed by people who should know better.” Prosecutors wanted 30 days in jail for Lolos, who entered the Capitol through a broken window, chanted in support of the mob as he walked through the building, and yelled, “They left! We did it!” as he left. He came to law enforcement’s attention when he was kicked off a plane after the riot for being disruptive and chanting, “Trump 2020!” Mehta sentenced him to 14 days.“People like Mr. Lolos were told lies and falsehoods and told that an election was stolen when it clearly was not,” Mehta said. “Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos for whatever reason are impressionable and will believe such falsehoods and such lies ... and they are the ones who are suffering the consequences.” Advertisement     No judge has found that individual rioters weren’t culpable because they were corrupted by online conspiracy theories or inspired by Trump.“No one was swept away to the Capitol,” Jackson said at Russell Peterson’s sentencing this month. “No one was carried. The rioters were adults. And this defendant, like hundreds of others, walked there on his own two feet and he bears responsibility for his own actions. There may be others who bear greater responsibility and who also must be held accountable, but this is not their day in court, it is yours.” ●

241,Betty White has died just before her 100th birthday. The beloved icon's extraordinary career spanned over 80 years. https://www.buzzfeednews.com/.../betty-white-obituary...,"


Betty White, the beloved television icon whose career spanned eight decades, died Dec. 31 just weeks before she was to turn 100.Her agent, Jeff Witjas, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but in a statement to People, he confirmed her death.""Even though Betty was about to be 100, I thought she would live forever,"" Witjas said. ""I will miss her terribly and so will the animal world that she loved so much. I don't think Betty ever feared passing because she always wanted to be with her most beloved husband Allen Ludden. She believed she would be with him again."" Advertisement     Los Angeles authorities confirmed that officers responded to her address for what was believed to be a ""natural cause of death,"" but did not provide further details. Fire officials said they responded to a ""medical aid request"" and confirmed the death of a 99-year-old woman.White was best known for her role as naive St. Olaf, Minnesota, native Rose Nylund on The Golden Girls, which ran from 1985 to 1992 and earned White an Emmy Award and six nominations. Earlier this week, White told People that she felt ""so lucky to be in such good health and feel so good at this age.""
 


While her part on the endlessly rerun series may have gotten her the most name recognition, White's career began long before The Golden Girls and went on for decades after.Her first TV appearance was in 1939, a few months after her high school graduation. She began working in radio in the 1940s before getting her first regular TV gig on the variety show Hollywood on Television in 1949. In 1951, she was nominated for an Emmy in the Best Actress on Television category, the very first time the award was given (it went to Gertrude Berg).
 


White worked steadily through the ’60s and ’70s, with memorable appearances on game shows like What's My Line?, Match Game, and Password. She married Password host Allen Ludden in 1963, and they remained together until his death in 1981. (""I had the love of my life,"" White told Anderson Cooper in 2011. ""If you've had the best, who needs the rest?"")In 1973, White began her stint as Sue Ann Nivens on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. She proved adept at capturing the contrast between Nivens' sweet on-air persona as ""the Happy Homemaker"" and her sarcastic, sexually voracious real-life demeanor. She won two Emmys for her performance.After The Mary Tyler Moore Show ended in 1977, White continued to take on guest and recurring TV roles. In 1983, she became the first woman to win a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Game Show Host (for the NBC series Just Men!). Two years later, she landed her career-defining part on The Golden Girls. White was originally considered for the role of Blanche, but director Jay Sandrich believed she should do something different after playing man-hungry so memorably on Mary Tyler Moore.
 


For the rest of her career, White would continue to take on roles where she played up the surprising dirty side behind her sweet exterior.While she continued acting after the cancellation of The Golden Girls in 1992 — and its ill-fated spinoff, The Golden Palace, in 1993 — her major resurgence didn't begin until the late 2000s, thanks to her role in the 2009 romantic comedy The Proposal and a 2010 grassroots campaign that propelled White into hosting Saturday Night Live. At age 88, she became the oldest person to host the show. That same year, White joined the cast of TV Land's Hot in Cleveland. Her character, Elka Ostrovsky, was written just for the pilot, but White's performance had her upgraded to a regular for all six seasons of the series.
 


Outside of acting, White was a devoted animal rights advocate, working for decades with organizations such as the Morris Animal Foundation and the Los Angeles Zoo Commission. She was awarded the American Veterinary Medical Association's Humane Award in 1987.Beyond her charity work, White was a symbol of making the most out of one's later years: She enjoyed the most popularity and acclaim at an age when most people are long retired. When she was awarded the Guinness World Record for longest TV career for a female entertainer, White said, ""I have no regrets at all. None. I consider myself to be the luckiest old broad on two feet.""News of White's death sparked an outpouring of grief and remembrances on social media. Former SNL cast member Seth Meyers said the Golden Girl was the only celebrity host he saw get a standing ovation at the show's afterparty. ""A party at which she ordered a vodka and a hotdog and stayed til the bitter end,"" Meyers tweeted.Ryan Reynolds, who starred alongside White in The Proposal, said on Instagram, ""The world looks a little different now"" without his grandma Annie.""She was great at defying expectation,"" Reynolds wrote. ""She managed to grow very old and somehow, not old enough. We’ll miss you, Betty. Now you know the secret.""In a statement, their costar Sandra Bullock said she would do as White did.""I don’t drink vodka … but I will tonight, on ice, with a slice of lemon with a hot dog on the other side and just be okay being sad,"" Bullock said. ""I’ll have to buy some rose-colored glasses because Betty was that for all of us.""
 


Jamie Lee Curtis remembered her You Again costar as ""full of love and creativity and integrity and humor and dedication and a life of service to animals"" in an Instagram post.""What women WANT is to live a life like Betty White,"" Curtis wrote. ""Rest easy you beautiful woman. We will carry on for you!""
 


Kathy Griffin shared a touching tribute in a Twitter thread, talking about the times she spent with White while on set.""She treated me like we were in the same club or something. She actually treated me like an equal in the comedy gurrrl world,"" Griffin wrote. ""She was as sharp and funny as she was soft and wise and no matter how long this world continues to spin, there will be only one Betty White.""
 


Mitchell Hurwitz, a TV writer and producer who worked on The Golden Girls, remembered White for her quick wit.""She was such an incredibly special person, so funny, so warm - and so strong,"" Hurwtiz tweeted. ""And I have a feeling she lied about her age and actually made it to 100.""

242,"From sea shanties, to Bernie Sanders’ mittens, and “the feminine urge” – these are the most defining memes of 2021.","


[Note: This post — the sixth annual in a series! — is a list, not a ranking, so please don't yell at us if your favorite is #27 or whatever.]1. The Stuck Ship
 


On March 23, the container ship Ever Given was just makin’ its way downtown when strong winds wafted it off course, lodging it sideways in the Suez Canal. The vessel, bigger than the Empire State Building, blocked the global trade route for days, preventing billions of dollars of goods from reaching their destinations.So, yeah, global trade disaster, the economy, sure, it wasn’t great. But over on the Good Ship The Internet, people spiraled it into a huge and undeniably delightful meme on Twitter symbolizing all of life’s most daunting obstacles. Ever Given wiggled free nearly a week later (because of THE MOON!!!), but I, for one, support the stuck ship getting stuck again sometime.2. Sea Shanties
 


Speaking of nautical memes, sea shanties had a huge moment in early January, searing them into history as one of the first major memes of 2021. Scottish singer Nathan Evans posted a rendition of “The Wellerman” on TikTok in the last week of 2020. In the following weeks, it blew up with people duetting it, layering their own vocals and instrumentation until it turned into a gradually growing viral chorus.A number of other 19th-century maritime folk songs also became hugely viral after that. Their popularity might’ve had something to do with the timing; between a pandemic winter and a deadly insurrection, things were feeling pretty bleak. These simple, catchy earworms — and the creative camaraderie they sparked — were a wholesome reprieve.3. Cheugy
 


Chevron print. Mugs emblazoned with #girlboss (see #8) or “but first, coffee.” Posting a picture of your significant other on Instagram and captioning it “my forever wedding date😍.” These highly specific things, and many others, are what one might label as “cheugy.” The term (pronounced chew-ghee) entered the public consciousness in a TikTok on March 30, but the woman who posted it told the New York Times that she and her friends had been using it since she coined it in 2013 to describe the basic millennial aesthetic. Advertisement     Though the TikTok had gotten pretty big on its own, it was only after Yahoo and the New York Times published articles about it that “cheugy” blew up across social platforms and received tons of media coverage and freakouts by 30-somethings. In reality, the backlash far outweighed the prevalence of anyone actually using the term, but the culture was already primed for some millennial-versus–Gen Z warfare; in the preceding months, discourse had been percolating that zoomers had “canceled” skinny jeans and side parts. And while there had been a handful of anti–skinny jean TikToks that set it in motion, they were vastly outweighed by millennials’ anti–anti–skinny jeans/pro–side part TikToks (including a few in the form of musical parody, which, of course, is the most cheugy form of comedy). Basically, no one’s actually calling anyone cheugy, and in fact, calling someone cheugy would be pretty cheugy. (Except BuzzFeed, which is def cheugy.)4. Bernie Sanders’ Mittens
 


It’s hard to believe President Biden was inaugurated this year, but he was, which was also how we wound up with easily the biggest political meme of 2021. Outside the Capitol on Jan. 20, Sen. Sanders was photographed wearing an extremely practical parka and mittens while carrying a manila envelope in a look that can best be described as “Vermont dad popping out for a quick errand.” The image instantly became a massive meme, with people inserting the photo into various images like a sort of Where’s Waldo? puzzle. (This was, as returning readers of this series know, Bernie’s second year in a row making it into the annual meme compendium.)In an interview on Late Night With Seth Meyers days later, Sanders said he’d seen the memes, explaining he had just “sitting there, trying to keep warm.” He gave a shoutout to the second-grade teacher who handknit the mittens for him after he lost his bid for president in 2016. Advertisement     5. Noodle the Pug
 


Bones or no bones? This was the question that determined our days, and the answer came from Noodle, a 13-year-old pug who became one of TikTok’s biggest stars this year. Each morning, Noodle’s owner, Jonathan Graziano, hoists the senior dog out of bed to see if he’ll stand up. When he succeeds, it is declared a “Bones Day,” and when he instead slumps back into bed as if he has not a single bone in his body — you guessed it — that’s a “No Bones Day.” Graziano started posting these videos in August, but they began getting millions of views in October, and the concept of “Bones Days” became a pervasive part of the online lexicon. Like reading tea leaves, but with an adorably floppy pup.6. Couch Guy
 


Long-distance relationships can be tough, but they’re probably a lot tougher if half the internet bands together to accuse you of cheating on your girlfriend. That’s what happened to Robert McCoy in September after his girlfriend, Lauren Zarras, posted a TikTok of her surprising him at his college. Presumably, she thought viewers would find it heartwarming, but it backfired immensely. Comments poured in insisting McCoy’s demeanor “was not excited at all” and that they could “feel the awkward tension.”People speculated he was cheating with one of the other women on the couch. The couple denied anything was wrong. Zarras defended him in the comments, and McCoy (who by now was better known as “Couch Guy”) posted his own TikTok, saying, “don’t be a creep,” under which commenters accused him of gaslighting. Some people even broke the video down frame by frame to “prove” McCoy was disloyal and that the couple would soon split. Advertisement     Zarras and McCoy beat the odds and are still together — but even months later, her TikTok comments remain a mess; people are obsessively checking in to see if they’ve broken up and picking apart everything she posts to theorize on the state of their relationship. In an essay for Slate in December, McCoy said the ordeal was reminiscent of True Crime TikTok’s history of people going too far with their sleuthing, like what happened with the Gabby Petito case and how Sabrina Prater, a trans woman who posts dancing TikToks, was targeted by a baseless conspiracy theory that she was a serial killer.“There will inevitably be more Couch Guys or Praters in the future,” McCoy wrote. “When they appear on your For You page, I implore you to remember that they are people, not mysteries for you to solve.”7. Astronaut in the Ocean
 


🎶 Whatchu know about rollin’ down in the deep? 🎶 I apologize to everyone who spent all of 2021 on TikTok for getting this stuck in your head again. “Astronaut in the Ocean” by Australian rapper Masked Wolf came out in 2019 but went hugely viral this year until it felt like it was in almost every other TikTok. People got preeeetty sick of it. As part of the backlash, the song became a sort of rickroll, with people mashing it up into other songs. “Bro I felt nauseous for a second,” one person commented on a mashup of the song with Katy Perry’s “Roar.”8. Gatekeep, Gaslight, Girlboss
 


The mythical “girlboss” jumped the millennial pink shark before the year even began. Women founders of chic, statusy companies — including the Wing, Away, and Reformation — faced accusations of toxic and even racist workplaces and not living up to the progressive ethos so outwardly key to their brands. Girlbosses, it turned out, didn’t lead the revolution (and were, in fact, kinda cringe).Though the ironic usage of “girlboss” was already common by 2020 to highlight the emptiness of corporate feminism, this year gave us the ultimate catchphrase for aspiring she-EOs everywhere: “gatekeep, gaslight, girlboss.” The phrase first appeared on Tumblr in January, according to Know Your Meme, and quickly took internet culture by storm (particularly in TikTok comments). Another phrase, “girlbossed a bit too close to the sun,” also became a meme on TikTok. (Honorable mention goes to being “a woman in STEM.”9. The Backyardigans
 


The Backyardigans, a musical children’s show that aired on Nickelodeon from 2004 to 2013, had a major nostalgic resurgence on TikTok this spring, starting when TikToker Merlysha Pierre posted in April about the program’s numerous “supersonic bops.” Several of the show’s original songs, including “Into the Thick of It,” and “International Super Spy,” went viral, and “Castaways” became so popular it reached the top of Spotify’s global viral chart.The show’s voice actors, as well as lyricists and composers behind the music, told BuzzFeed News in June they were moved and amazed to see their work being celebrated so widely years later.“I’m still floored at how many years have gone by and people are making this a big thing, but I also understand, because I smile every time I think of The Backyardigans,” said Jamia Simone Nash, the singing voice behind Uniqua. “Being a part of everyone’s childhood, that’s been the best part of my career.” Advertisement     10. Kathryn Hahn Winking
 


WandaVision was one of the most popular TV shows of the year, so naturally, we got some memes out of it. Kathryn Hahn winking became basically the 2021 version of “sure, Jan,” and people got really creative with it.11. The Feminine Urge
 


2021 was all about embracing your femininity when it came to this meme. Starting in October, tweets about ones’ highly specific “feminine urges” — “to hunt and gather (steal),” “to hold your boob when you’re bored,” “to die for Harry Styles” — were everywhere on the site, and they quickly spread to Instagram and TikTok. Despite the chokehold it had across platforms, the meme actually originated months earlier on Tumblr (a common genesis with these kinds of text-based memes), according to Know Your Meme.12. “No Children” by the Mountain Goats
 


A 2002 indie-folk song about divorce may not scream viral TikTok challenge contender, but 2021 finds a way. The depressing tune started taking off on the platform in October and wound up spiraling into a whole dance trend (featuring a lot of cats). Advertisement     The Mountain Goats’ lead singer John Darnielle told Vox it felt odd to learn of the virality of “No Children,” but he’s happy to see a new generation enjoying the band’s music. “There is a certain joy in sort of feeling like, well, the kids have got a thing going on that I’m not going to fully get. But I can just enjoy watching,” he said. “I think people fear getting older and fear that they’ll feel left out, but there’s a kind of buoyancy in that left-out quality sometimes, if you ride it the right way.”13. Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Oprah
 


Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s sitdown interview with Oprah Winfrey was undoubtedly one of the biggest TV events of 2021. The conversation was full of bombshells that left many stunned — including Winfrey herself, whose expression of shock wound up becoming a huge reaction meme on Twitter.14. Bama Rush
 


One wild week in August, people suddenly found their TikTok feeds flooded with blonde women in Shein statement earrings, Steve Madden wedges, and brightly colored skirts and dresses from somewhere called “Pants Store.” We’re talking, of course, about sorority rush at the University of Alabama, with other Southern schools hopping in on the trend soon after. Videos of the potential new members (PNMs) showing off their outfits before each recruitment round went viral, catapulting some of them to TikTok stardom faster than you can say “jewelry is normal.” #BamaRush became such a sensation that people posted their predictions guessing what sorority each PNM would get into, and some dressed up for parody TikToks sharing their own “oh oh tee dees.” Advertisement     15. Berries and Cream
 


If you spent any time on YouTube in the 2000s, you might remember this little lad and his love of berries and cream. The 2007 ad for Starburst was a viral hit at the time, but this summer, it had something of a renaissance and fully took over TikTok. You could hardly scroll through your feed without getting rickrolled by the jingle or seeing someone dancing the signature jig.The original “little lad,” performance artist Jack Ferver, even got in on the fun, starting their own TikTok account where they dress up and perform as the iconic character. “What I found interesting was writing back to people who were commenting, and really getting into that zone of performing the Little Lad,” Ferver told the New York Times. “It’s another performance art piece.”16. Here Comes the Boy
 


🎶 Here comes the boyyyy, hello boy, welcome, there he is, he is here… 🎶 This little ad-libbed jingle became one of TikTok’s most wholesome audio memes over the summer when user @june_banoon posted a video singing it to a neighbor’s cat (named Johnny, but who goes by the excellent nickname “Mashed Potatoes”).Naturally, everyone loved it, and a ton of people made duets, accompanying it on pianos, guitars, violins, flutes, harps, and trumpets and layering on their own vocal harmonies until it was transformed into a gorgeous, cumulative symphony.17. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy?
 


And now, clinching the elusive 2021 title of horniest meme of the year! “Mommy. Sorry? Mommy,” first originated in August, when TikTok user @roofjesus said it in a thirsty post about their girlfriend. The audio blew up, especially among queer women on the platform.But the place the phrase became most ubiquitous was in comment sections; scroll through the comments on any thirst-trappy TikTok and you’re bound to find it. Some have criticized the trend, saying the comments sexualize people who didn’t ask to be.18. People Kildren
 


This kicked off in a TikTok by @lawrinkydink from May where he attempts to sing the Black Eyed Peas’ classic “Where Is the Love?” and gets the lyrics totally wrong, making up words while attempting to remember them. His version goes “children peekle, people kildren.” Inspired by the commitment to continue even when clueless, people started making their own videos to it. Like in this one, a TikTok user counts how many times he uses the same wrong words in the video. In another, someone wrote out the entire lyrics and that eventually led to a really soothing cover.19. Bean Dad
 


There’s an old adage that every day there is a main character of Twitter, and “the goal is to never be it.” That goal was promptly fumbled by podcaster John Roderick, or as you more likely know him, “Bean Dad,” who on Jan. 2 tweeted a thread about how, as a “teaching moment,” he made his 9-year-old daughter spend hours trying to figure out how to open a can of beans rather than just open it for her himself. Advertisement     What transpired was a backlash so fierce that “milkshake ducking” could ostensibly be renamed “bean dadding.” People piled on Roderick, criticizing his parenting and accusing him of child abuse (he later said a few even reported him to Child Protective Services). Roderick deleted his account after offensive tweets he’d posted years prior were resurfaced, and he wound up apologizing (both for those tweets, as well as the thread) in a lengthy blog post.20. White Girl Dancing
 


Whilst the observation that white girls dance just slightly offbeat with their hands in the air has been long noted by historians, this year it really took off as a meme. Videos of people dancing with their hands in the air, typically to the Calvin Harris song “How Deep Is Your Love,” became a meme in early summer this year. Black people on TikTok then started lifting their White Claws in the air to do the dance too. One Black TikToker told Mashable he found the white girl dance to be “freeing.”21. Two Guys on the Bus
 


The meme of the two people on opposite sides of a bus, where one of the passengers gets a view and the other does not, really took off in mid-November. The way it works in meme form is by associating something negative with the sad-faced passenger looking out at the hill and something positive with the lucky fellow looking out at the view. According to Know Your Meme, the meme was first used by Brazilian Twitter users and then it made its way to Reddit and eventually back to the English-speaking side of Twitter. Now lots of people have filled in their own texts, such as sad boy’s “people remembering their childhoods” sitting across from smiling “their moms being like ‘that’s not how I remember it’” guy. Advertisement     22. Naur
 


“Naur” is a play on how Australians pronounce the word “no” with stan Twitter really turning it into a ~cool~ way of disagreeing with something. It also became popular through the TikTok meme based on the Australian TV show H2O where people would remake a scene and say “Oh naur Cleo.” For those of you who know about the speaking in italics meme, “naur” is pronounced like the italic version of “no.” Or, if you’re Aussie, it’s just pronounced correctly.BuzzFeed News senior culture writer (and noted Australian) Estelle Tang explained in her story that “naur”’ took off after a viral TikTok where someone screamed it and the comments of that video ended up filled only with the word. People didn’t only say “naur” with the Aussie twang; they also started making memes about its pronunciation, such as this Normani tweet that has us wheezing into our Vegemite toast.23. The Omarion Variant
 


The announcement of the Omicron variant of coronavirus was met with the same exhausted but frenzied energy as Delta: memes. However, this time, thanks to the variant’s name’s similarity to that of the musician and former lead singer of B2K, the meme potential was even wilder. The internet renamed it “the Omarion variant,” posting videos and photos of the Californian singer (he even joined in himself on the tweets). Omarion dancing in the music video for the song aptly named “Touch” was the perfect meme, as was this one riffing off the lyrics from his song “Post to Be.” This moment made the “my plans vs. the Delta variant” tweets feel like a lifetime ago.24. Immortal Snail
 


Imagine this: You are offered millions of dollars and the chance to become immortal. The catch? A giant snail — whose mere touch will kill you instantly — also becomes immortal and will hunt you down for eternity. This hypothetical scenario originated in 2014 on the podcast Rooster Teeth but resurfaced in August in a TikTok from @benjhandy. By October, the immortal snail had became a meme in its own right, with tons of people making TikToks about it (usually paired with John Lennon’s “Happy Xmas (War Is Over),” for inexplicable reasons) depicting their eternal hell evading the slimy menace’s slow but unrelenting pursuit.25. Waking Up in the Morning
 


🎶Waking up in the morning, thinking about so many things…🎶 Easily one of the biggest musical memes of the year, this song could most often be found in TikToks of people revealing their most embarrassing moments. It comes from a 2011 episode of Real Housewives of New Jersey, during which a then–10-year-old Gia Giudice performed an emotional rendition of her made-up song in an effort to convince her mom and uncle to stop fighting.The now–20-year-old took her belated viral fame in stride, posting her own TikTok in March lip-synching to it. In an interview with Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live, Giudice said she never imagined her song would blow up a decade later, “but honestly, I think it’s so funny and I’m just owning it at this point.”26. Yassification
 


If you’ve seen Lin-Manuel Miranda with a full contour, the Quaker Oats guy with platinum blonde hair extensions, or all four members of Weezer with lip fillers and a smoky eye, you probably already know this one. One of the biggest LGBTQ memes of the year, “yassification” consisted of editing images of famous figures in FaceApp to transform them into the Instagram Face version of themselves. The word “yassification” (derived from “yaaas queen,” the term that originated with queer people of color in 1980s ball culture but went mainstream in the mid-2010s thanks to Broad City and a Lady Gaga fan’s video) first appeared on Twitter in 2020, according to Know Your Meme, but it wasn’t until this November that it fully took off. “Yassified” images started bubbling up all over Twitter and TikTok, particularly on the account @YassifyBot. Denver Adams, the 22-year-old art student behind the account, told BuzzFeed News in November that they hope their creations make people consider how apps like FaceApp can contribute to unhealthy beauty standards.“The bottom line is it’s a satire of this ageist technology and insane beauty standards through these artificial intelligence apps,” Adams said.27. Gorgeous Gorgeous Girls
 


Hot girl summer may have come and gone, but 2021 was all about being a gorgeous, gorgeous girl. The phrase comes from an August TikTok, in which user @fishdress professed that “gorgeous, gorgeous girls love soup.” It went massively viral, and tons of people posted their own versions, with the expression becoming ubiquitous on Twitter as well.The markers of a gorgeous, gorgeous girl vary widely, but may include loving pickles, taking the train because they can’t drive, listening to Simple Plan, having stomach problems, adopting pit bulls, getting their booster shot, and pretending “to be Beth March dying of scarlet fever every time they’re near the sea.” Really, anyone can be a gorgeous, gorgeous girl if they decide they are one.28. Milk Crate Challenge
 


This is a challenge that probably shouldn’t have taken off the way it did. The Milk Crate Challenge involved stacking crates into a pyramid and scaling it — often to disastrous results. Doctors advised against it, with some telling the Washington Post they had treated patients who’d taken part.People would film themselves walking up the crates like stairs, but because of the lack of stability, many wound up brutally wiping out. Even so, people continued to attempt the challenge, and one woman even completed it in high heels.The internet did its bit to warn people of the danger, with the best meme PSA being, of course, the edit of “Jason Derulo” tumbling down the crates.29. I Know It Ain’t the Stallion
 


This meme comes from none other than the queen Keke Palmer, who was the red carpet presenter for Vogue at this year’s Met Gala. When Megan Thee Stallion walked up, she said, “Oh oh oh, I know it ain’t… I know it ain’t the staaallion… You know it's your girl!” and the rest was history.That audio really took off on TikTok when a user remixed it with a keyboard. The sound went viral, and users made their own versions in the same format. For example, “I know it ain’t the consequences of my actions,” which JoJo Siwa used.Palmer later addressed the meme in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. “Why am I at my job doing that?” she said. “I don’t know what it is with me.”30. Red Flags
 


The red flag meme is one of the few memes from this year that will definitely make it long term: It’s short, simple, and memorable. First started on Black Twitter with people naming obvious negative traits someone could have, it quickly escalated from actual red flags about a person to just straight-up jokes. Obviously brand accounts jumped on it like they would any good meme, with MTV getting ratioed hard for their own red flag attempt.31. The Girls That Get It, Get It
 


This came from a TikTok user by the name of @khaenotbae from a video she posted in November. In a comment underneath, she explained she was mimicking Flavor of Love’s Tiffany Pollard.People have used the sound in TikToks about little inside jokes or life hacks they swear by, such as tips for makeup or filming TikToks. Though her audio went viral, TikTok somehow removed her original video but the sound remained up.As the trend went on, some people started to use it for things that are either too basic or ridiculous, which has led to people criticizing the meme.In case the voice sounds familiar to you, the TikTok user responsible for this sound is also the mastermind behind: “And by the way, I have a question and don’t fight me because I know how you girls like to tussle.”32. Good Soup
 


“Good soup,” a meme for when the soup is good (shoutout to my gorgeous, gorgeous girls). The simple audio clip comes from one of the final episodes of Girls, in which Adam Driver and Lena Dunham decide to part ways. Punctuating the emotional conversation held in a diner booth, Driver eats a spoonful of soup, throws up the “OK” hand sign, and says “good soup.” Though the episode aired in 2017, it wasn’t until August that it made its way to TikTok, and it quickly became a huge meme used to all sorts of wacky ends.In an interview with Screenrant, Driver said he was aware of the meme but didn’t really get it. “I mean, like I understand what memes are, I guess, but it’s not something I keep track of or am tracking,” he said.No worries, Adam, that’s what we’re here for.

243,Huge decisions will be made in the next few years about who gets water from the shrinking Colorado River.  Basin tribes are fighting to get their share.,"



 


This is Part 3 in a Colorado River Series. For Part 2, click here.On a 120-degree day, as waves of hot air shimmer above deeply cracked earth, it is difficult to imagine that a hundred years ago this land was part of a vast 2-million-acre expanse of blue waters and verdant trees that formed the delta of the Colorado River. Once robust enough for steamships to cross, the delta supported a thriving ecosystem with thousands of migratory birds and wetland species. Now, a bleached skeleton of a crab is one of the few signs of life remaining.The delta’s disappearance was the first indication that modern management of the river was pushing the system past its capacity. Starting in the 1930s, construction of major dams and diversions redirected water from the river to reservoirs, farms, and cities from Denver to Los Angeles. By 1960, water stopped regularly flowing to the delta, and over time, 90% of its 2 million acre expanse withered.“The river is so altered and contained now, I call it a big canal,” said Nora McDowell, who served as chair of the Fort Mojave Tribe for 25 years and actively leads efforts to protect the Colorado River. “This isn’t the river we knew. It used to be just wild. Where I swam, the water was blue and it was clean. It was our playground. … I remember it as a great blue lagoon.”The Colorado River is now at a tipping point, with implications stretching far beyond its delta. Water levels at the Lake Mead and Lake Powell reservoirs, which depend on snowmelt to feed the river, reached historic lows this year. For over two decades, Western states sharing the river have relied on water from these reservoirs to insulate their residents from feeling the impacts of a relentless 22-year megadrought.
 


But in August, water levels in the reservoirs dropped low enough to trigger the first-ever federal shortage declaration, which will cut states’ 2022 river usage by billions of gallons. More cuts are likely: 2021 was the second-driest water year on record, and a growing body of data indicates what we are seeing is not a temporary drought, but a permanently hotter, more arid environment and a significantly smaller Colorado River.Successfully managing water shortages in the short term, while developing solutions for the management of the Colorado River in the long term, is imperative for the 40 million people who depend on its waters. Ultimately, the crisis on the Colorado River is a story about how the United States chooses to adapt to climate change.Current projections indicating another dry year are “a stark reminder that we need to continue to do more,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant interior secretary for water and science, said at the recent Colorado River water users conference. “In addition to the short-term emergency decisions we will be making, we also need to be very real about the challenge of building long-term solutions in this basin.” Advertisement  This month, Arizona, California, Nevada, and the federal government announced a plan to temporarily address water shortages. The plan commits $200 million toward projects to stabilize Lake Mead and leave billions more gallons of water in the river through 2023.Looking ahead, however, a fundamental question looms for those sharing the river: The current drought contingency policies, which govern how the parties share cuts during times of water shortage, will expire in 2026. They were designed to be temporary, but it appears increasingly clear that a drier climate may be a permanent reality for the southwest. So now it must be resolved: What will happen when those agreements expire? And who will make those decisions?
 


A seat at the tableSince the 1920s, management of the river has been dominated by the seven Western states that signed the 1922 Colorado River Compact. A foundational document guiding how the river is managed, the compact split the river’s water between the “upper basin” states of Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico and the “lower basin” states of Nevada, Arizona, and California. Advertisement  But it failed to allocate water for the 30 sovereign tribes of the Colorado River Basin (a majority of which have water rights that predate the compact), the northern states of Mexico, where the river ends, or for the health of the river itself.A century later, with clear evidence of the consequences of these exclusions, the region’s sovereign tribes and conservation groups are pushing for a seat at the table with the states and the federal government as they approach negotiations to set new rules for post-2026 management of the river.To this day, the basin’s 30 sovereign tribes aren’t formally part of the decision-making bodies governing the Colorado River, despite holding water rights to 20% of its water, an amount greater than allocated to some states in the region.Daryl Vigil, co-facilitator of the Water & Tribes Initiative, a leading group in the Colorado River Basin advocating for more equitable and sustainable policies, says tribes need an institutionalized way to engage in policy-making. “Without this, we cannot exercise our sovereignty or right to self-determination,” he said.The basin tribes were not included in 2007 intrastate and federal negotiations to develop the first interim guidelines responding to drought conditions. In 2012, when basin states and the Department of Interior completed a study to “assess current and future water and supply imbalances,” the water usage and rights of the tribes were not adequately considered, leading to a separate study that was published years later. Advertisement  Despite being marginalized, the basin’s tribes are taking on a leadership role as water shortages have deepened, offering solutions and being among the first water users to contribute water to support critical drought plans.In 2019, The Gila River Indian Community and the Colorado River Indian Tribes' willingness to conserve water was critical to the success of drought contingency plans. In the recent $200 million deal to conserve additional water through 2023, the Gila River Indian Community and the Colorado River Indian Tribes collectively contributed over a quarter of the water pledged. Yet the underlying framework that currently guides the river’s operations was made without their input.The basin tribes’ continued involvement in the process depends on executive memorandums and statements of commitment. No legally binding documents or formally established positions guarantee them a place in the bodies that govern the river.“The [1922] compact talks about an equitable apportionment of water in the Colorado River Basin, but when it was created, my tribe was living on subsistence rations in a place that wasn’t our homeland. So much of the current framework surrounding this river is based on legislation and policy that tribes have had no formal access to,” Vigil said. “You have 30 tribal sovereigns in the Colorado Basin that have lived sustainably here for thousands of years. Why aren’t we including people in the conversation who have known how to live resiliently?” Advertisement  
 


In a recent letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, leaders from 20 tribes in the basin called on her to ensure tribal sovereigns have a clear role in upcoming negotiations to develop the next framework governing the Colorado River. The letter also announced the creation of a Colorado River Basin Tribal Coalition, where leaders will gather to build consensus on new policies, and asked the Interior Department to encourage states to meaningfully engage with tribes in their internal and interstate negotiations. Advertisement  Tribal water rights are considered as part of states’ overall allocations of water from the river. As tribes reach water settlements, states have to account for this water from their portion of the river. But with increasing pressure on states to cut existing water usage during shortages, the interests of state water managers do not always align with the interests of the basin’s tribes as they actualize their water rights.Responding to the tribes’ letter, Haaland wrote that the Interior Department intends to hold “listening sessions” with tribal leadership in 2022. Trujillo, who is tasked with leading that process, said in an interview that the department will incorporate feedback into future negotiations, but she declined to specify if they would formally establish a place for tribal leaders.
 


As the basin’s tribes push for representation in upcoming negotiations for the river’s future, they are navigating a related inequity — access to clean water.Despite holding significant rights to the Colorado River, many of the basin’s tribes lack water security. On Navajo Nation, the largest reservation in the basin, 30 to 40 percent of residents lack indoor plumbing and haul water to meet their basic needs. Compared to other Americans, Navajo residents are 67 times more likely to live without access to running water.“If we look at these issues through the lens of people not having access to water, they are just different aspects of the same fundamental problem,"" said Bidtah Becker, Associate Attorney for the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority. “Have we separated water issues so far that we no longer see the connection between the shortages of water currently being experienced on the river and the fact that there are people in this basin who do not have access to clean water from that very river?” Advertisement  
 


Water shortage as an opportunityMany conservation groups active in the Colorado River Basin view the post-2026 negotiations as a chance to build a management system that’s flexible enough to respond to the impacts of climate change as the river shrinks. With billions in federal funding newly allocated in the 2021 infrastructure bill for addressing impacts of water shortages, Western states have resources to invest in a variety of solutions. Advertisement  “There are so many things we can do beyond debating water allocations,” said Jennifer Pitt, director of the Audubon’s Colorado River Program. “This is climate change barging through the front door of the Colorado River Basin. It calls for all hands on deck. We cannot get by in the long run with a short-term solution stacked on top of a short-term solution. We need long-term resilience plans and systems thinking.”Just south of the US–Mexico border, a binational coalition of conservation groups called Raise the River is slowly rebuilding areas of critical natural habitat in the river’s former delta. In the last decade, the coalition has restored over 1,500 acres across several restoration sites with an amount of water that, Pitt said, amounts to less than 1% of the river’s annual flow. According to Audubon’s research, restored sites along the Colorado River delta have species populations that are 80% greater than those of lands not yet restored.At Laguna Grande, the largest of the sites, dragonflies dart across deep pools ringed by mesquite trees, and desert temperatures noticeably drop under the shade of cottonwoods. Here, it feels possible to imagine how alive the delta once was. Advertisement  Securing water for the project required building partnerships between the US and Mexican governments, creating a water trust, raising millions of dollars, and passing two treaty agreements. The treaties were the first of their kind in the basin to designate water specifically for nature and the river itself. Pitt pointed to the delta restoration project as an example of how collaboration can benefit people, animals, and the river.“Rather than being a scary, dangerous prospect to bring excluded parties to table, I think we are actually seeing more parties with a broader solution set willing to think creatively,” Pitt said.Planning focused on building resilience is increasingly supported by a number of groups. A recent report issued by the Nature Conservancy, American Rivers, Environmental Defense Fund, and several other nonprofits identifies 10 strategies for policymakers to consider as they search for solutions for the Western water crisis. Ranging from the more theoretical, such as ways to slow snow melting, to the well established, such as technology that increases agricultural efficiency, the report proposes a broader approach to addressing water shortages.
 


Water is life“Our people were specifically put where we are along these rivers and streams…We are born from water,” said McDowell, explaining the Fort Mojave Indian Tribe’s historical connection to the Colorado River. “The Creator placed us here when he created us. The heartbreak is to see it being misused and seeing it over allocated. Because it is a living spirit.” Advertisement     The story of the Colorado River is thousands of years old, but we are still very much at the start of the next chapter of its existence — one in which the centrality of water to life, and its deep interconnections, will only grow clearer as scarcity intensifies. The changing climate will become an inescapable fact of life for everyone in the West.“We have to anticipate that future inflows will be less than [those of] the last 22 years,” said senior water and climate scientist Brad Udall, calling on policymakers to be realistic and develop future management plans based on data, which indicates a much drier future. “When I hear the phrase ‘new normal,’ I actually get a little frustrated. … What we are seeing is not anything related to normal. Normal implies predictability. This climate is not stationary; it is going to continue to change, and people need to plan for less water.”While progress has been made toward addressing current shortages, it remains to be seen whether long-term agreements on more fundamental changes can be reached in a basin accustomed to incremental policy adjustments — and whether political promises of cooperation and inclusion result in concrete actions. Advertisement     “Water gives us life,” McDowell said. “People need to start thinking about the impacts of our use of this river from a long-term perspective — not just about how much money this company or person is going to make. If we’re not careful in what we decide, we will cease to exist.”

244,"“Lord, please free my people from the hold of this illustration.”","


With just a matter of days until the new year, if you exist in certain pockets of Twitter, you’ve likely seen an illustration of a Black woman stepping from one year into the next wearing high heels with a bag in hand.The illustration, created by British Ghanaian graphic artist Peniel Enchill, first appeared on the internet in 2014 and routinely goes viral each year. It has also become synonymous on Black Twitter with the saying “New year, new me.” Advertisement     In 2021, it went viral again in the middle of the year during the milk crate challenge when people thought a Black woman who completed the challenge in heels resembled the artwork.“I did that artwork in hours. It usually takes me a while to finish up an illustration. But I had what I like to call these days a ‘download,’ where you literally see the picture in your mind and it's just a matter of transferring that image from your mind to the paper. I rarely get that, but that was one of them,” Enchill told BuzzFeed News.The 29-year-old, who is based in Sheffield, England, recalled posting her artwork to her Instagram at a time that preceded the platform’s stories feature.“I remember logging back into Instagram and on my main feed, not on my profile, but on my main feed, I just kept swiping and seeing the image that I've drawn,” she said. “So these were actual reposts from people that I follow.” Advertisement     
 


The image was shared by larger platforms, including the Shade Room, and within hours, it was everywhere. Overnight, her audience on Instagram grew by 40,000. But as the popularity and reach of her artwork expanded, so did opinions, which were followed up with memes, reedits, and misogynistic trolling.“All I could see was the negative. Yes, there was positive feedback, but it was clouded by a lot of negative, and I took it quite personally,” she said.It took a word of advice from Enchill’s younger brother for her to see past the small pockets of negativity as her platform exploded, bringing new eyes to her entire portfolio.“My brother, being my brother, was like, 'Why are you upset? Have you seen how many followers you've got? Have you seen how many people have seen it? It's all over Twitter,’” she said. “I think it took me a whole day or two to start seeing the positive sides.”
 


Today, Enchill has over 270,000 followers on Instagram and can consistently chart a surge of growth around this time of year.Enchill said she is a big believer in how transformative a new year can be, and continues to create special illustrations to mark the end of one year and the start of another.Reflecting on her 2014 piece, she said that she was looking for a way to communicate that going into the new year is like stepping into a better year.“I think I'm still like that,” she said. “I still enter the year exactly like the girl that I drew. Reflecting on the year before, thinking about what I'm trying to achieve in the new year.”She said it’s still slightly hard to see her art used in a way that she wouldn't have approved of if she had been asked. Many of the memes of the woman were misogynistic and edited her going back to bad situations concerning relationships with men.She also said she has been approached about turning her artwork into NFTs (nonfungible tokens), but she is struggling to understand the benefit of it. “I don't think I've come to a comfortable place with that yet,” she said. “I might just have to do one to see how I feel about it all, but I'm not 100% sold on the idea yet.”
 


Black women are always central in Enchill’s art, often depicting them in storylines that deal with pushing back against cultural norms and unrealistic expectations demanded of them.“My focus is particularly on the Black community, with an extra focus of Black women and uplifting, inspiring, creating art for us, by us — speaking about issues that are not really spoken about, and celebrating things that affect us directly,” she said.She also owns a stationery brand that features her art, and hopes to one day see it stocked at major retailers.This year’s artwork is still in progress, she added, but the inspiration behind it is the well-known phrase “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.” But that, of course, hasn’t stopped people from making their own.

246,Death tolls from extreme weather in the US are often significantly undercounted. ,"


The number of people who die from extreme weather in the US is being alarmingly undercounted. Without accurate knowledge of the true loss of human life, it will be hard to know how to save more people when the next disaster strikes. Families of the uncounted victims will struggle to get benefits, political leaders will not feel the pressure to better prepare, and people will not realize how lethal climate change really is in the US, right now.As global warming brings more intense weather extremes, the need for more reliable data is literally a matter of life and death. Here’s how and why the data is so inaccurate.Take the unprecedented heat wave that hit the Pacific Northwest in late June and early July. According to data downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Events Database, supposed to be a key US resource on the impacts of extreme weather, only seven people died in Washington state from excessive heat. Advertisement  During this time, emergency services were overwhelmed by calls for help, and coroners later recorded that dozens of people had died from heat-related illnesses; it's absurd to suggest that the death toll was in single figures. Having combed through death certificates, state authorities eventually put the number of people who perished in Washington at 119 between June 26 and July 2. Yet the toll for the state in NOAA’s database remained unchanged (the database was down at the time of publication).Even more troubling is that the state’s toll of 119 is also a massive undercount. This is according to a BuzzFeed News analysis that examines how many more people die after a given event, comparing it to the number predicted from long-term and seasonal trends. This approach, known as an “excess deaths” analysis, is the most comprehensive method for estimating hard-to-tally death counts — it has been used, for instance, to calculate the full global toll from the COVID-19 pandemic.For the Pacific Northwest heat wave, our excess deaths analysis represents the most complete accounting yet. In Washington state, it reveals that the heat wave likely killed more than 440 people there in the week ending July 3. And it suggests that another 230 or so people were killed that same week in Oregon — again more than that state’s list of 96 recorded heat wave deaths. Advertisement  The Pacific Northwest heat wave is just one example of how official sources are failing to account for the full toll from extreme weather. “I think it’s critically important that we know how destructive these events are, both in terms of capital losses and human losses — and we don’t,” John Mutter, an environmental and social scientist at Columbia University who studies the impacts of natural disasters, told BuzzFeed News. “We could be off by a long way.” Experts agree that there is currently no accurate national database accounting for the lives lost to extreme weather.With climate change already increasing the frequency or severity of deadly weather extremes, this official ignorance is a big and growing problem. “It’s extremely important, because you can’t manage something that you don’t measure,” Susan Cutter, who heads the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News.Solving this problem will require an overhaul of how deaths are recorded and sophisticated analytical methods to model the relationships between extreme weather and deaths. Right now, however, that isn’t a top priority for most state and federal agencies. By failing to account for the full toll so they can learn how to reduce it, government officials are missing chances to save hundreds or thousands of people from avoidable deaths, overheated or frozen in their homes or on the streets, or caught up in the chaos of a devastating storm. Advertisement  
 


In the US, the two main official sources of information on deaths related to extreme weather are NOAA’s Storm Event Database and the CDC, which is the main federal agency responsible for mortality statistics. On a global scale, severe weather deaths are tracked in an international database, EM-DAT, which covers a wide range of disasters from earthquakes to transport accidents, and is the World Meteorological Organization’s go-to source for information on deaths from weather and climate extremes.
 


This chart, derived from NOAA’s Storm Events Database, EM-DAT, and underlying causes of death recorded by the CDC from death certificates, shows how each source gives a different picture of the annual death toll in the US from extreme weather.“We have a problem here,” Debarati Guha-Sapir of the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, formerly director of its Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, which runs EM-DAT, told BuzzFeed News. “If the data is misleading, it can bring us a whole lot of grief, because conclusions can be wrong.”Much of the discrepancy in the leading databases arises from differences in their methods for tracking weather-related deaths. NOAA’s Storm Events Database starts from recorded weather events and then assesses the death toll mostly from numbers provided by local officials or reported in the media. EM-DAT takes a similar event-based approach — in its case looking at events in which 10 or more people died, 100 or more people were affected, or where a state of emergency was officially declared.The other leading approach, used by the CDC, is to compile counts from the causes listed on death certificates — possible because the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has a series of codes that relate to extreme weather, including “Exposure to excessive natural heat” and “Victim of flooding.” Advertisement  
 


The CDC’s numbers for extreme weather deaths are much higher. This is mainly due to its more complete accounting for deaths attributed to excessive natural cold or heat, which averaged 733 and 410 per year respectively from 2000 to 2020. Many people die from overheating or cold outside of extreme heat waves or cold snaps, so are missed by event-based methods.But as the system works right now, death certificates are also missing many fatalities from weather extremes. The CDC gets its data from the states, which in turn compile information from local coroners and medical examiners. And how they fill in death certificates is far from standardized.What gets recorded on a death certificate also typically misses the indirect ways in which storms and other severe weather events can kill, including deaths from traffic accidents as people evacuate, electrocution from downed power lines, or heart attacks from overexertion.The NOAA event-based database does try to account for those indirect deaths, as does EM-DAT. But the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather ripple out in ways that are hard to measure. “Displaced elderly people are very vulnerable,” said Mutter. “They lose track of what their medications are.”NOAA’s failure so far to recognize the full extent of what happened in Washington state during the summer heat wave shows how inadequate event-based recording can be. A NOAA spokesperson noted that the CDC “maintains the official government records on cause of death” and said that NOAA’s numbers for an event that happened almost six months ago were still “preliminary.”“The verification process for the heat wave in late June/early July is ongoing,” the NOAA spokesperson said by email.
 


Deaths can also accumulate over much longer periods than are typically considered by officials accounting for the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather. The most extreme example happened in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017. As cremations took place in the wake of the storm without being included in the official death count, nobody familiar with the situation on the ground believed the US territory’s official tally of just 64 deaths.The full toll was revealed only by comparing the number of deaths that occurred in previous years with the much higher numbers over the weeks that followed the storm, as Puerto Rico was hit by widespread power outages and disruptions to its healthcare system. In December 2017, the New York Times estimated that around 1,000 people more than expected had died in the six weeks after Maria made landfall. Finally, Puerto Rico’s governor commissioned a study from George Washington University, which estimated the storm-related death toll out to February 2018, coming up with a figure of 2,975.In reality, none of the official sources are hitting the right numbers. “I tell students and others to never trust a death toll, no matter who is estimating it,” Mutter said.As emergency managers and public health experts try to convince political leaders of the urgency of action to counter climate change and to reduce the impact of the severe weather it is brewing, the data gaps are becoming more pressing. “If you don’t capture the damage, there is no pressure you bring to bear,” Guha-Sapir said.
 


This year has shone a particularly harsh light on the deficiencies in official accounting for the toll from extreme weather. According to state and local counts, the winter storm that hit Texas in February and the Pacific Northwest heat wave were the two deadliest extreme weather events in the US this year — followed by the tornadoes that devastated parts of the South and Midwest over the night of Dec. 10–11 and Hurricane Ida and its remnants.But it took excess deaths analyses to reveal how bad the Texas freeze and Northwest heat wave really were. In May, BuzzFeed News estimated the true toll in Texas in February, which was hundreds more than the official count. Similar to methods used to investigate the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, we trained statistical models on mortality data that the CDC collects from individual states, which were then used to estimate the number of expected deaths in any week in any state. These models were reviewed by three independent experts in excess deaths analysis.We then compared the models’ predictions to the number of deaths that were actually recorded, after subtracting deaths attributed to COVID-19. (The models were trained on data from 2015 to 2019, before the pandemic hit.) Advertisement  In May, when the Texas Department of State Health Services was recording 151 winter storm deaths, we estimated that just over 700 more people than expected had died in Texas during the week of the storm and worst power outages. The state’s tally has since increased to 210. As more death certificate data has been transferred from Texas to the CDC, our analysis now estimates the excess death toll in the week ending Feb. 20 at more than 750.Our estimates for the Pacific Northwest heat wave, which suggest that around 670 people likely died as a result of the excessive heat across Washington and Oregon in the week ending July 3, were calculated in exactly the same way.The BuzzFeed News analysis of these events also underlined the shortcomings of relying on the underlying cause of deaths recorded on death certificates, as the spikes we identified were driven in large part by deaths attributed to causes other than exposure to cold or heat. Instead, many deaths triggered by the Texas freeze and by the heat wave in Washington were recorded as deaths from underlying medical conditions — in particular, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.That makes sense, as people who are already medically vulnerable are more likely to die if exposed to excessive cold or heat. But it means that the CDC’s counts of deaths from extreme weather based on ICD codes are missing an important part of the picture. “Underlying cause is certainly not always going to have the complete information,” Robert Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC, told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement  In some states and counties, recording deaths is the responsibility of coroners who may have no specialist medical training. What’s needed, experts told BuzzFeed News, is greater standardization in death reporting, including noting additional factors that contributed to someone’s death as well as an underlying cause.
 


Clearly, more sophisticated approaches are needed to track the true toll of extreme weather and climate change on human lives. “We have to modernize. We have to find new methods,” said Guha-Sapir. That includes excess deaths analysis, she added.Other insights can come from epidemiological studies that examine in detail the relationship between the number of recorded deaths in a given place and time, and extreme weather there.Where that has been done, estimates for deaths associated with extreme heat exceed the numbers recorded by the CDC from death certificates. In April 2020, researchers led by Kate Weinberger, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia, estimated that heat accounted for more than 5,600 deaths per year from 1997 to 2006 across some 300 counties. The area studied covered more than 60% of the US population. Advertisement  A national study of trends in heat deaths published in December 2020 from researchers led by Scott Sheridan, a climatologist at Kent State University in Ohio, used similar methods to show that progress in reducing heat deaths was stalling. This came after decades in decline, possibly due to the widespread adoption of air conditioning and better awareness of the risks. Among men ages 45 to 64 across parts of the South and Southwest, heat death rates were actually increasing.For wildfire smoke, one of the biggest single causes of weather- and climate-related deaths, epidemiological studies provide the only way of counting the dead.Studies that have modeled the long-term effects of breathing air laden with tiny particles from wildfire smoke indicate that thousands of Americans die every year as a result. Given the trend for larger and more intense wildfires driven by climate change, the number is forecast to double by the end of the century, according to a 2018 study from researchers led by Bonne Ford, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. This increasing toll from wildfire smoke is expected to partly offset public health gains from reducing other forms of air pollution.But you won’t find deaths from wildfire smoke listed in any official database. “When people talked about the costs of wildfires, it was all about the cost of fighting fires, damage to property, and direct deaths from the fire,” Ford told BuzzFeed News. “That’s the motivation for why we started doing these studies.” Advertisement  
 


Knowing how many people are dying from extreme weather is only the start. To reduce the toll, you also need to know which groups of the population are most vulnerable, and have a plan to protect them at times when the risks are most severe. In general, the burden falls most heavily on the less wealthy and on racial minorities: A study published in October from the CDC, based on ICD codes from death certificates, found that the death rate from natural disasters for Black people was 1.87 times times higher than for white people, while for Native Americans the rate was 7.34 times higher.The details vary from place to place, however. In Multnomah County, Oregon, which includes the city of Portland, the people hardest hit during this year’s heat wave were older, living alone, on higher floors of buildings, and with no air conditioning, according to the county’s public health director, Jessica Guernsey. Advertisement     But in Maricopa County in Arizona, home to some 4.5 million people who live in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and where almost every day in the summer brings life-threatening heat, the risk profile is very different. There, the typical victim is a man without regular shelter in his 40s or 50s with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. Often people die from exposure to heat after overdosing, said David Hondula, who in September was appointed to head the city of Phoenix’s new Heat Response & Mitigation Office. “It’s that story over and over and over again,” Hondula told BuzzFeed News.The Maricopa County Department of Public Health is one of the most thorough in the nation at recording deaths from extreme heat. Yet the toll there has been steadily rising. In 2020, Maricopa County recorded 323 heat-associated deaths, an increase of more than 60% from 2019, and 15 times the number recorded in 2001. If reducing heat mortality is the “barometer for success,” Hondula said, “we are failing.”Given the link between these deaths and substance abuse, Hondula’s office is now considering measures that — without the data at its disposal — might seem unconnected to the dangers of excessive heat. One idea is to equip volunteers with the Phoenix Community Emergency Response Team with Narcan, the emergency treatment for opioid overdoses. Advertisement     
 


If cities and states across the nation are to reduce the death toll from extreme weather, they will need to overhaul their methods for counting the dead, develop better systems to recognize when emergency plans need to be activated, and have a comprehensive approach to reducing the risks for the most vulnerable people.“There’s a whole suite of hazard mitigation that can come into play,” said Cutter. “We need better preparedness. We need better warning systems. We need to do some interventions such as adding more greenery to cities.” The last measure can help reduce the urban heat islands that can turn poorer neighborhoods into death traps in the summer as asphalt and concrete absorb the sun’s heat. Advertisement     As the Pacific Northwest heat wave showed, responding to the reality of climate change may mean dealing with events that exceed anything that has come before. Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who studies health risks from climate change, has advocated for “stress testing,” in which local health agencies, emergency responders, and other stakeholders conduct war game–like exercises to consider how to respond to hypothetical extreme weather outside of their previous experience.But there are formidable structural and political obstacles to overcome. “I’ve never believed numbers from a state agency. They always have reasons to exaggerate or diminish,” Mutter of Columbia University said. When it comes to getting aid from the federal government, states have a vested interest in stressing how hard they were hit by a disaster. But when the death toll is largely due to failures in a state’s own infrastructure or planning, the incentive works the other way.Deaths from extreme cold in Texas in February are a case in point. Several states were hit by the winter storm that swept through the region around Valentine’s Day weekend. But only Texas experienced a large spike in deaths, after its power grid failed. This came a decade after the state had been warned by federal officials that its power infrastructure was vulnerable to cold, after narrowly escaping a similar disaster in 2011. Advertisement     The CDC, meanwhile, has been working with the National Association of Medical Examiners to try and improve the recording of deaths following natural disasters, and has online training materials that encourage coroners, medical examiners, and physicians to take a broader view of what gets recorded as a disaster-related death. But with responsibility for recording deaths lying with local and state authorities, the CDC is limited to an advisory role — it has no direct power to change how deaths are recorded at the local level.
 


And while several federal agencies have offices focusing on climate and health, there has so far been no concerted effort across the US government to better account for the lives lost to extreme weather. “It’s nobody’s responsibility,” Ebi said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is charged with making sure the US is prepared to withstand and respond to major disasters, but has “not really been part of the picture,” Ebi added.“We know that extreme weather is a matter of life or death,” Jaclyn Rothenberg, FEMA’s director of public affairs, told BuzzFeed News by email. “As emergency management continues to evolve to meet the demands of our changing climate, it will continue to necessitate us to become more advanced in the ways we understand and react to extreme weather.”After a year of successive weather disasters, which have exposed both the fragility of US infrastructure and the nation’s inability to count the lives lost, experts say there should be an urgent focus on improving data gathering and acting on that information.Right now, they warn, local, state, and federal agencies are in the dark, flying into a major storm, as climate change threatens an even more hazardous future.“Disasters are windows of opportunity to make change,” Ebi said. But the tragedy is that officials often only start planning for weather extremes after the bodies start piling up. “Until it’s in their face, it tends to not happen.” ●Zahra Hirji contributed reporting for this story.

247,"More than 500 homes were destroyed and tens of thousands of people were forced to evacuate after high winds whipped two wildfires through suburbs near Boulder, Colorado.","


More than 500 homes were destroyed and tens of thousands of people were forced to evacuate after high winds whipped two wildfires in suburban areas near Boulder, Colorado, on Thursday.Both fires were likely started by downed power lines, Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said, but officials are continuing to investigate. As of Thursday evening, only one injury had been reported — debris blew into a police officer's eye — but Pelle stressed the human toll could be higher. Advertisement     By Friday morning, however, there were still no reports of fatalities, he said, adding that a person who had been reported missing was accounted for and doing well.""So that's awesome news, and actually, I think given the events that we had yesterday, pretty miraculous,"" Pelle said during a news conference.Kelli Christensen, a spokesperson for UCHealth Broomfield Hospital, told BuzzFeed News the facility received six patients in connection with the fires. Christensen did not provide any information about their condition or injuries, citing privacy laws.The Middle Fork and Marshall fires started Thursday morning and exploded as wind gusts of more than 100 mph hit the region. As of Thursday evening, the Marshall fire had burned through 1,600 acres, prompting evacuations in Superior and Louisville, as well as parts of Broomfield. Videos on social media showed people leaving stores that shut down as smoke loomed. Advertisement     
 


All 370 homes in the Sagamore subdivision outside the town of Superior were destroyed, as well as 210 homes in the Old Town neighborhood. A shopping center and hotel also burned, and authorities said the full scope of damage in other neighborhoods remained unknown.""I would estimate it's going to be at least 500 homes,"" Pelle said, but added that he would ""not be surprised if it's 1,000.""The fires burned over an area that includes approximately 2,000 homes, but some neighborhoods were left standing, while others were completely devastated, authorities said.
 


The National Weather Service Boulder extended a high-wind warning until 8 p.m. Thursday for locations at the base of the foothills, but winds weakened in the area of the fires overnight.""We were fortunate that the winds dissipated last night,"" Pelle said.As snow began to fall over the Boulder area Friday morning, authorities said that as long as the weather holds up there shouldn't be much additional damage from the fires.
 


Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he spoke with President Joe Biden on Friday and that the state has been approved for federal assistance. Still, he recognized that many things lost could not be replaced.“There’s no way to quantify in any financial way the price of a loss, the price of losing the chair that was handed down to you from your grandmother, of losing your childhood yearbooks, of losing your photos, of losing your computer files, which hundred of Colorado families have experienced today with no warning,"" Polis said.Footage from a Denver7 News reporter showed homes continued to burn Thursday night.
 


Weather disasters are inextricably linked to human-induced climate change. The planet has already warmed 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, according to NASA, and that’s making disasters worse. Wildfire seasons are getting longer. Hurricanes are getting wetter and more dangerous. Heat waves are getting hotter, more frequent, and longer-lasting. Heavier rainfall across the US is triggering more inland flooding. And the cost of climate disasters is soaring. Stopping this vicious cycle will require drastically reducing our reliance on climate-polluting fossil fuels.According to the NWS Boulder, the second half of this year was one the driest on record for the Denver area.""Denver received well above normal precipitation from February through June. But since then, precipitation has flat-lined,"" the station tweeted.
 


Polis also acknowledged how unusual the timing was for a wildfire.“Here in December, who thought we would be fighting a major grassland fire?” he said.On Friday, after viewing the damage from above, Polis again spoke to the shock of watching the disaster materialize so rapidly at a time when the state and the country are grappling with yet another surge in the coronavirus.""You know it feels like we’ve experienced enough tragedy and loss these last two years and then yesterday happened over the course of several hours,"" he said. ""This is our community and to watch it burn so quickly, so unexpectedly is something that I think we’re all just struggling to believe and understand.""

248,"Dershowitz, accused of sexual assault by Virginia Giuffre, one of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged victims, went on the BBC to discredit her accusations against him.","


The BBC has come under fire for airing a segment about the Ghislaine Maxwell verdict that featured commentary from a man who allegedly sexually assaulted one of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers, while failing to disclose that fact to viewers.In a statement Thursday, the network said that the appearance of lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who also had represented Epstein, did not meet its editorial standards.""Mr. Dershowitz was not a suitable person to interview as an impartial analysis and we did not make the relevant background clear to our audience. We will look into how this happened,"" the statement reads.In 2015, Virginia Giuffre said in a federal lawsuit that Epstein kept her as a sex slave and forced her to have sex with Dershowitz and Prince Andrew. Both men have strongly denied the allegations.Giuffre was not called to testify in Maxwell's trial, though she was mentioned hundreds of times in court proceedings. She is currently suing Andrew in New York federal court for sexual abuse.After Maxwell was found guilty of sex trafficking charges on Wednesday, Dershowitz appeared on BBC World News, where he was introduced simply as a ""constitutional lawyer,"" to discuss Maxwell's conviction.
 


Dershowitz criticized Giuffre during the segment, saying that the prosecutors' choice not to involve her in their case against Maxwell discredited her accusations against him and Epstein.""The government did not use as a witness the woman who accused Prince Andrew, who accused me, accused many other people because the government didn't believe she was telling the truth,"" Dershowitz said.He also addressed the ongoing proceedings between Giuffre and Andrew. He said Maxwell's conviction ""weakens the case against Prince Andrew considerably because the government was very selective in who it used.""The network immediately came under fire for the segment.
 


Dershowitz issued a statement on Twitter on Thursday morning after the backlash against his interview with the BBC.""Following the Maxwell conviction, BBC requested an interview, during which I explicitly stated that I , Prince Andrew and other people had been accused of having sex with Virginia Guffre,"" he said.""I commented on the prosecution’s wise decision not to use her as a witness because of her lack of credibility. The media has repeatedly interviewed victims of Epstein’s abuse,"" Dershowitz said in another tweet. He added that it was ""appropriate"" for the network to interview him and suggested that those accused of sexual assault by Giuffre were the ""victims.""

249,"The MCU never really deals with the ramifications and implications of the blip, but this is maybe not so very different from what it's like to live through surreal, unbelievable events.","


Here’s a cheerful holiday question, as we enter the third year of a once-a-century pandemic: What does it feel like to live through the world ending?This is — if you really, really zoom out — the question that occupies the aggregate Marvel Cinematic Universe. I’m not saying this is why everyone sees Marvel movies. Obviously not. They make money for the normal reasons of being entertaining, with some of the best and most charismatic actors in large-scale, interlocking adventure stories that occasionally elevate into greatness; they are without pretension and with the natural pull of superheroes (having a favorite). They are a good time. Advertisement  What I am saying, however, is that a real depth of the MCU derives, paradoxically, from a hollowness at its core: It's a series about the world ending via surreal external forces that never really deals with what it means for the world to end.I’ve been thinking about this for three reasons: a. The pandemic just won’t end, b. I have somehow seen six of the nine Marvel properties released in 2021, including Eternals, c. I happened to catch some of Iron Man recently.At the time of release, the original Iron Man was a true product of the George W. Bush years. In 2008, the film's sunshine wittiness and rejection of defense-contractor WMDs sat against the dominant superhero series of that era: Christopher Nolan's Batman. On some level, The Dark Knight, also released in 2008, concerns how far Americans should go to eradicate terrorism and what happens to those who do and why anyone would pursue that at all — a more realist (in presentation), more violent venture into the soul, where you might see a tattered American flag waving in the early morning sun. Rather than bleak, Iron Man is fun. Advertisement  Thirteen long, long years later, Iron Man — if you watch it right now — loses all that Bush-era context and gains a different one. If that exact movie were released today, given all that’s come since within the constructed MCU and in the unfolding trajectory of our real lives, you'd almost expect arch title cards at the beginning: “This was back before the aliens started invading and half the world's population disappeared for five years.” Back when things were messed up, back before they got REALLY messed up, possibly where it all began. It’s a much simpler, more contained movie, where the problems are entirely man-made and direct. Aliens don’t invade; people aren’t forced to kill each other or themselves to protect humanity; there isn’t even that much of a mysterious next property to set up yet.
 


Because Marvel has decided (so far) against completely rebooting existing properties under the Disney banner, the shows and films have begun to acknowledge how weird and extreme the last 10 years of the parallel Marvel world was.The latest Disney+ title, Hawkeye, opens with an 11-year-old girl — Kate Bishop (eventually Hailee Steinfeld) — watching aliens destroy her family’s penthouse and kill her father in 2012, i.e., a scene from the first Avengers movie, from a spectator’s perspective. These touches are usually more comic than anything: In that series’ present day, Hawkeye eyes “Thanos Was Right” graffiti, and catches a terrible musical rendition of the Avengers history. In Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Shaun (Simu Liu) walks past flyers advertising help coping with the blip: “POST-BLIP ANXIETY? YOU ARE NOT ALONE.” His college friend tells him, basically, it's time to grow up because you never know when half of humanity, including you, might disappear again.The more surface touches of this, though, weirdly, are reminiscent of the surface touches of the pandemic. The New York subways remain plastered, for instance, with an ad advising proper mask-wearing, featuring a consistent black-ink cartoon style against a rich gold-yellow backdrop. These cartoon characters started in summer 2020; they got winter clothes toward Christmas last year; they started reminding you to wear a mask even if you're vaccinated in the spring; now they remind you to wear a mask, ask you to read or look at your phone instead of talking, and get a booster vaccine (""Need a boost?""). Staring at one while on your way to the dentist has that same sort of surrealist humdrum irony touch. Advertisement  
 


Nothing deals with the preceding decade of the MCU without really dealing with the decade more than Spider-Man: Far From Home. That movie opens with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) arguing about how not every catastrophe is aliens, the catastrophe apparently being aliens, then a segue into a meme-looking high school PA in memoriam of fallen Avengers set to “I Will Always Love You,” and a recap of people returning from the blip with a lament that people had to take midterms and a returned marching band member getting hit in the face with a basketball. Shortly thereafter, Spider-Man and a joking Aunt May do a Salvation Army fundraiser for everyone in New York displaced from their homes by their own disappearance. Now Far From Home rules (many Spider-Mans converge on Spider-Man in a trippy virtual reality), and arguably a jokiness fits both Spider-Man and the overall realm of high school, but it does not per se encompass all the emotions that might follow half the earth’s population atomizing temporarily. Advertisement  Elsewhere in Phase Four of the MCU, this occasionally goes deeper, if briefly, like the suggestion of Kate Bishop’s origin story. WandaVision features Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) waking up from the blip in a cancer ward to find her mother died a long time ago; the hospital is total chaos. Hawkeye opens one episode with Florence Pugh’s Yelena stepping into a powder room and seeing herself disappear and reemerge in the blip, with the walls changing color around her as time jumps ahead five years. When she exits, her old friend has a husband and a child. The overall effect in 2021 is: Oh damn, it’s like the pandemic.What they aren’t really doing is dealing too much with how everyone keeps living their lives — on any deeper, presumably more emotionally chaotic level — despite the actual mass death, destruction, and resurrection that the Marvel world puts forward. The story stays pretty contained to a few dozen heroes; absolution is usually not too hard to achieve; the next thing is always coming, and whatever it is, it will follow the rhythms of the first thing. We all know to expect the last 15 to 30 minutes of a Marvel enterprise to be consumed by a CGI fight in the air with aliens/robots/dragons/witches (so much so that Spider-Man: Far From Home’s villain operates on that expectation) intermingled with some forward-looking irresolution. Even with (fun!) characters like Kate Bishop, Marvel doesn’t really delve too deeply into how and why the collapsing earth resulted in a wealthy 22-year-old beating up mafia bros (beyond a dope opening credits sequence).WandaVision, for instance, tells a very specific, deep Twilight Zone story about how the mind can try to rewrite a brutal, shocking loss. But when the narrative ventures toward how that kind of grief — no matter how real — can inflict pain on other people, the show backs away from dealing with the implications of what Marvel’s heroes wrought, in favor of the next thing (promoting Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange). Which is, actually, mostly fine; not everything must be The Leftovers or Crime and Punishment, and WandaVision offered plenty of compelling cuts of a life undone. And Spider-Man: Far From Home is fun as hell and they shouldn’t have changed anything about it. Advertisement  
 


The more I’ve thought about this eternal setup at the expense of the current thing, though, it’s seemed to me almost like an accidental depth, one that speaks to the last decade, in which it’s occasionally felt like the world is ending — or at least becoming complicated beyond previous recognition. And I wouldn’t exactly say this fundamental feature of the MCU makes most of these titles excellent art on the individual level about what it feels like for the world to feel like it’s ending.But taken together, at the 100,000-foot level, the fact that each property is basically about someone doing what they were doing anyway, then having to deal with some new iteration of surreal but familiar external forces invading, and never having any time to really think about what it all means because the next thing is already happening, as it turns out — now that we really do live in a notable historical period of continual surreal events that could make you question the foundations of society — everyone has to continue doing what they were doing anyway when the world is ending, and you’ll never have that much time to think about what it all means because the demands of the next thing will be upon you.What does it feel like when the world ends? It just feels like aliens invading until something else happens. ●

250,The feminine urge to document the most influential memes of the year.,"


[Note: This post — the sixth annual in a series! — is a list, not a ranking, so please don't yell at us if your favorite is #27 or whatever.]1. The Stuck Ship
 


On March 23, the container ship Ever Given was just makin’ its way downtown when strong winds wafted it off course, lodging it sideways in the Suez Canal. The vessel, bigger than the Empire State Building, blocked the global trade route for days, preventing billions of dollars of goods from reaching their destinations.So, yeah, global trade disaster, the economy, sure, it wasn’t great. But over on the Good Ship The Internet, people spiraled it into a huge and undeniably delightful meme on Twitter symbolizing all of life’s most daunting obstacles. Ever Given wiggled free nearly a week later (because of THE MOON!!!), but I, for one, support the stuck ship getting stuck again sometime.2. Sea Shanties
 


Speaking of nautical memes, sea shanties had a huge moment in early January, searing them into history as one of the first major memes of 2021. Scottish singer Nathan Evans posted a rendition of “The Wellerman” on TikTok in the last week of 2020. In the following weeks, it blew up with people duetting it, layering their own vocals and instrumentation until it turned into a gradually growing viral chorus.A number of other 19th-century maritime folk songs also became hugely viral after that. Their popularity might’ve had something to do with the timing; between a pandemic winter and a deadly insurrection, things were feeling pretty bleak. These simple, catchy earworms — and the creative camaraderie they sparked — were a wholesome reprieve.3. Cheugy
 


Chevron print. Mugs emblazoned with #girlboss (see #8) or “but first, coffee.” Posting a picture of your significant other on Instagram and captioning it “my forever wedding date😍.” These highly specific things, and many others, are what one might label as “cheugy.” The term (pronounced chew-ghee) entered the public consciousness in a TikTok on March 30, but the woman who posted it told the New York Times that she and her friends had been using it since she coined it in 2013 to describe the basic millennial aesthetic. Advertisement     Though the TikTok had gotten pretty big on its own, it was only after Yahoo and the New York Times published articles about it that “cheugy” blew up across social platforms and received tons of media coverage and freakouts by 30-somethings. In reality, the backlash far outweighed the prevalence of anyone actually using the term, but the culture was already primed for some millennial-versus–Gen Z warfare; in the preceding months, discourse had been percolating that zoomers had “canceled” skinny jeans and side parts. And while there had been a handful of anti–skinny jean TikToks that set it in motion, they were vastly outweighed by millennials’ anti–anti–skinny jeans/pro–side part TikToks (including a few in the form of musical parody, which, of course, is the most cheugy form of comedy). Basically, no one’s actually calling anyone cheugy, and in fact, calling someone cheugy would be pretty cheugy. (Except BuzzFeed, which is def cheugy.)4. Bernie Sanders’ Mittens
 


It’s hard to believe President Biden was inaugurated this year, but he was, which was also how we wound up with easily the biggest political meme of 2021. Outside the Capitol on Jan. 20, Sen. Sanders was photographed wearing an extremely practical parka and mittens while carrying a manila envelope in a look that can best be described as “Vermont dad popping out for a quick errand.” The image instantly became a massive meme, with people inserting the photo into various images like a sort of Where’s Waldo? puzzle. (This was, as returning readers of this series know, Bernie’s second year in a row making it into the annual meme compendium.)In an interview on Late Night With Seth Meyers days later, Sanders said he’d seen the memes, explaining he had just “sitting there, trying to keep warm.” He gave a shoutout to the second-grade teacher who handknit the mittens for him after he lost his bid for president in 2016. Advertisement     5. Noodle the Pug
 


Bones or no bones? This was the question that determined our days, and the answer came from Noodle, a 13-year-old pug who became one of TikTok’s biggest stars this year. Each morning, Noodle’s owner, Jonathan Graziano, hoists the senior dog out of bed to see if he’ll stand up. When he succeeds, it is declared a “Bones Day,” and when he instead slumps back into bed as if he has not a single bone in his body — you guessed it — that’s a “No Bones Day.” Graziano started posting these videos in August, but they began getting millions of views in October, and the concept of “Bones Days” became a pervasive part of the online lexicon. Like reading tea leaves, but with an adorably floppy pup.6. Couch Guy
 


Long-distance relationships can be tough, but they’re probably a lot tougher if half the internet bands together to accuse you of cheating on your girlfriend. That’s what happened to Robert McCoy in September after his girlfriend, Lauren Zarras, posted a TikTok of her surprising him at his college. Presumably, she thought viewers would find it heartwarming, but it backfired immensely. Comments poured in insisting McCoy’s demeanor “was not excited at all” and that they could “feel the awkward tension.”People speculated he was cheating with one of the other women on the couch. The couple denied anything was wrong. Zarras defended him in the comments, and McCoy (who by now was better known as “Couch Guy”) posted his own TikTok, saying, “don’t be a creep,” under which commenters accused him of gaslighting. Some people even broke the video down frame by frame to “prove” McCoy was disloyal and that the couple would soon split. Advertisement     Zarras and McCoy beat the odds and are still together — but even months later, her TikTok comments remain a mess; people are obsessively checking in to see if they’ve broken up and picking apart everything she posts to theorize on the state of their relationship. In an essay for Slate in December, McCoy said the ordeal was reminiscent of True Crime TikTok’s history of people going too far with their sleuthing, like what happened with the Gabby Petito case and how Sabrina Prater, a trans woman who posts dancing TikToks, was targeted by a baseless conspiracy theory that she was a serial killer.“There will inevitably be more Couch Guys or Praters in the future,” McCoy wrote. “When they appear on your For You page, I implore you to remember that they are people, not mysteries for you to solve.”7. Astronaut in the Ocean
 


🎶 Whatchu know about rollin’ down in the deep? 🎶 I apologize to everyone who spent all of 2021 on TikTok for getting this stuck in your head again. “Astronaut in the Ocean” by Australian rapper Masked Wolf came out in 2019 but went hugely viral this year until it felt like it was in almost every other TikTok. People got preeeetty sick of it. As part of the backlash, the song became a sort of rickroll, with people mashing it up into other songs. “Bro I felt nauseous for a second,” one person commented on a mashup of the song with Katy Perry’s “Roar.”8. Gatekeep, Gaslight, Girlboss
 


The mythical “girlboss” jumped the millennial pink shark before the year even began. Women founders of chic, statusy companies — including the Wing, Away, and Reformation — faced accusations of toxic and even racist workplaces and not living up to the progressive ethos so outwardly key to their brands. Girlbosses, it turned out, didn’t lead the revolution (and were, in fact, kinda cringe).Though the ironic usage of “girlboss” was already common by 2020 to highlight the emptiness of corporate feminism, this year gave us the ultimate catchphrase for aspiring she-EOs everywhere: “gatekeep, gaslight, girlboss.” The phrase first appeared on Tumblr in January, according to Know Your Meme, and quickly took internet culture by storm (particularly in TikTok comments). Another phrase, “girlbossed a bit too close to the sun,” also became a meme on TikTok. (Honorable mention goes to being “a woman in STEM.”9. The Backyardigans
 


The Backyardigans, a musical children’s show that aired on Nickelodeon from 2004 to 2013, had a major nostalgic resurgence on TikTok this spring, starting when TikToker Merlysha Pierre posted in April about the program’s numerous “supersonic bops.” Several of the show’s original songs, including “Into the Thick of It,” and “International Super Spy,” went viral, and “Castaways” became so popular it reached the top of Spotify’s global viral chart.The show’s voice actors, as well as lyricists and composers behind the music, told BuzzFeed News in June they were moved and amazed to see their work being celebrated so widely years later.“I’m still floored at how many years have gone by and people are making this a big thing, but I also understand, because I smile every time I think of The Backyardigans,” said Jamia Simone Nash, the singing voice behind Uniqua. “Being a part of everyone’s childhood, that’s been the best part of my career.” Advertisement     10. Kathryn Hahn Winking
 


WandaVision was one of the most popular TV shows of the year, so naturally, we got some memes out of it. Kathryn Hahn winking became basically the 2021 version of “sure, Jan,” and people got really creative with it.11. The Feminine Urge
 


2021 was all about embracing your femininity when it came to this meme. Starting in October, tweets about ones’ highly specific “feminine urges” — “to hunt and gather (steal),” “to hold your boob when you’re bored,” “to die for Harry Styles” — were everywhere on the site, and they quickly spread to Instagram and TikTok. Despite the chokehold it had across platforms, the meme actually originated months earlier on Tumblr (a common genesis with these kinds of text-based memes), according to Know Your Meme.12. “No Children” by the Mountain Goats
 


A 2002 indie-folk song about divorce may not scream viral TikTok challenge contender, but 2021 finds a way. The depressing tune started taking off on the platform in October and wound up spiraling into a whole dance trend (featuring a lot of cats). Advertisement     The Mountain Goats’ lead singer John Darnielle told Vox it felt odd to learn of the virality of “No Children,” but he’s happy to see a new generation enjoying the band’s music. “There is a certain joy in sort of feeling like, well, the kids have got a thing going on that I’m not going to fully get. But I can just enjoy watching,” he said. “I think people fear getting older and fear that they’ll feel left out, but there’s a kind of buoyancy in that left-out quality sometimes, if you ride it the right way.”13. Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Oprah
 


Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s sitdown interview with Oprah Winfrey was undoubtedly one of the biggest TV events of 2021. The conversation was full of bombshells that left many stunned — including Winfrey herself, whose expression of shock wound up becoming a huge reaction meme on Twitter.14. Bama Rush
 


One wild week in August, people suddenly found their TikTok feeds flooded with blonde women in Shein statement earrings, Steve Madden wedges, and brightly colored skirts and dresses from somewhere called “Pants Store.” We’re talking, of course, about sorority rush at the University of Alabama, with other Southern schools hopping in on the trend soon after. Videos of the potential new members (PNMs) showing off their outfits before each recruitment round went viral, catapulting some of them to TikTok stardom faster than you can say “jewelry is normal.” #BamaRush became such a sensation that people posted their predictions guessing what sorority each PNM would get into, and some dressed up for parody TikToks sharing their own “oh oh tee dees.” Advertisement     15. Berries and Cream
 


If you spent any time on YouTube in the 2000s, you might remember this little lad and his love of berries and cream. The 2007 ad for Starburst was a viral hit at the time, but this summer, it had something of a renaissance and fully took over TikTok. You could hardly scroll through your feed without getting rickrolled by the jingle or seeing someone dancing the signature jig.The original “little lad,” performance artist Jack Ferver, even got in on the fun, starting their own TikTok account where they dress up and perform as the iconic character. “What I found interesting was writing back to people who were commenting, and really getting into that zone of performing the Little Lad,” Ferver told the New York Times. “It’s another performance art piece.”16. Here Comes the Boy
 


🎶 Here comes the boyyyy, hello boy, welcome, there he is, he is here… 🎶 This little ad-libbed jingle became one of TikTok’s most wholesome audio memes over the summer when user @june_banoon posted a video singing it to a neighbor’s cat (named Johnny, but who goes by the excellent nickname “Mashed Potatoes”).Naturally, everyone loved it, and a ton of people made duets, accompanying it on pianos, guitars, violins, flutes, harps, and trumpets and layering on their own vocal harmonies until it was transformed into a gorgeous, cumulative symphony.17. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy?
 


And now, clinching the elusive 2021 title of horniest meme of the year! “Mommy. Sorry? Mommy,” first originated in August, when TikTok user @roofjesus said it in a thirsty post about their girlfriend. The audio blew up, especially among queer women on the platform.But the place the phrase became most ubiquitous was in comment sections; scroll through the comments on any thirst-trappy TikTok and you’re bound to find it. Some have criticized the trend, saying the comments sexualize people who didn’t ask to be.18. People Kildren
 


This kicked off in a TikTok by @lawrinkydink from May where he attempts to sing the Black Eyed Peas’ classic “Where Is the Love?” and gets the lyrics totally wrong, making up words while attempting to remember them. His version goes “children peekle, people kildren.” Inspired by the commitment to continue even when clueless, people started making their own videos to it. Like in this one, a TikTok user counts how many times he uses the same wrong words in the video. In another, someone wrote out the entire lyrics and that eventually led to a really soothing cover.19. Bean Dad
 


There’s an old adage that every day there is a main character of Twitter, and “the goal is to never be it.” That goal was promptly fumbled by podcaster John Roderick, or as you more likely know him, “Bean Dad,” who on Jan. 2 tweeted a thread about how, as a “teaching moment,” he made his 9-year-old daughter spend hours trying to figure out how to open a can of beans rather than just open it for her himself. Advertisement     What transpired was a backlash so fierce that “milkshake ducking” could ostensibly be renamed “bean dadding.” People piled on Roderick, criticizing his parenting and accusing him of child abuse (he later said a few even reported him to Child Protective Services). Roderick deleted his account after offensive tweets he’d posted years prior were resurfaced, and he wound up apologizing (both for those tweets, as well as the thread) in a lengthy blog post.20. White Girl Dancing
 


Whilst the observation that white girls dance just slightly offbeat with their hands in the air has been long noted by historians, this year it really took off as a meme. Videos of people dancing with their hands in the air, typically to the Calvin Harris song “How Deep Is Your Love,” became a meme in early summer this year. Black people on TikTok then started lifting their White Claws in the air to do the dance too. One Black TikToker told Mashable he found the white girl dance to be “freeing.”21. Two Guys on the Bus
 


The meme of the two people on opposite sides of a bus, where one of the passengers gets a view and the other does not, really took off in mid-November. The way it works in meme form is by associating something negative with the sad-faced passenger looking out at the hill and something positive with the lucky fellow looking out at the view. According to Know Your Meme, the meme was first used by Brazilian Twitter users and then it made its way to Reddit and eventually back to the English-speaking side of Twitter. Now lots of people have filled in their own texts, such as sad boy’s “people remembering their childhoods” sitting across from smiling “their moms being like ‘that’s not how I remember it’” guy. Advertisement     22. Naur
 


“Naur” is a play on how Australians pronounce the word “no” with stan Twitter really turning it into a ~cool~ way of disagreeing with something. It also became popular through the TikTok meme based on the Australian TV show H2O where people would remake a scene and say “Oh naur Cleo.” For those of you who know about the speaking in italics meme, “naur” is pronounced like the italic version of “no.” Or, if you’re Aussie, it’s just pronounced correctly.BuzzFeed News senior culture writer (and noted Australian) Estelle Tang explained in her story that “naur”’ took off after a viral TikTok where someone screamed it and the comments of that video ended up filled only with the word. People didn’t only say “naur” with the Aussie twang; they also started making memes about its pronunciation, such as this Normani tweet that has us wheezing into our Vegemite toast.23. The Omarion Variant
 


The announcement of the Omicron variant of coronavirus was met with the same exhausted but frenzied energy as Delta: memes. However, this time, thanks to the variant’s name’s similarity to that of the musician and former lead singer of B2K, the meme potential was even wilder. The internet renamed it “the Omarion variant,” posting videos and photos of the Californian singer (he even joined in himself on the tweets). Omarion dancing in the music video for the song aptly named “Touch” was the perfect meme, as was this one riffing off the lyrics from his song “Post to Be.” This moment made the “my plans vs. the Delta variant” tweets feel like a lifetime ago.24. Immortal Snail
 


Imagine this: You are offered millions of dollars and the chance to become immortal. The catch? A giant snail — whose mere touch will kill you instantly — also becomes immortal and will hunt you down for eternity. This hypothetical scenario originated in 2014 on the podcast Rooster Teeth but resurfaced in August in a TikTok from @benjhandy. By October, the immortal snail had became a meme in its own right, with tons of people making TikToks about it (usually paired with John Lennon’s “Happy Xmas (War Is Over),” for inexplicable reasons) depicting their eternal hell evading the slimy menace’s slow but unrelenting pursuit.25. Waking Up in the Morning
 


🎶Waking up in the morning, thinking about so many things…🎶 Easily one of the biggest musical memes of the year, this song could most often be found in TikToks of people revealing their most embarrassing moments. It comes from a 2011 episode of Real Housewives of New Jersey, during which a then–10-year-old Gia Giudice performed an emotional rendition of her made-up song in an effort to convince her mom and uncle to stop fighting.The now–20-year-old took her belated viral fame in stride, posting her own TikTok in March lip-synching to it. In an interview with Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live, Giudice said she never imagined her song would blow up a decade later, “but honestly, I think it’s so funny and I’m just owning it at this point.”26. Yassification
 


If you’ve seen Lin-Manuel Miranda with a full contour, the Quaker Oats guy with platinum blonde hair extensions, or all four members of Weezer with lip fillers and a smoky eye, you probably already know this one. One of the biggest LGBTQ memes of the year, “yassification” consisted of editing images of famous figures in FaceApp to transform them into the Instagram Face version of themselves. The word “yassification” (derived from “yaaas queen,” the term that originated with queer people of color in 1980s ball culture but went mainstream in the mid-2010s thanks to Broad City and a Lady Gaga fan’s video) first appeared on Twitter in 2020, according to Know Your Meme, but it wasn’t until this November that it fully took off. “Yassified” images started bubbling up all over Twitter and TikTok, particularly on the account @YassifyBot. Denver Adams, the 22-year-old art student behind the account, told BuzzFeed News in November that they hope their creations make people consider how apps like FaceApp can contribute to unhealthy beauty standards.“The bottom line is it’s a satire of this ageist technology and insane beauty standards through these artificial intelligence apps,” Adams said.27. Gorgeous Gorgeous Girls
 


Hot girl summer may have come and gone, but 2021 was all about being a gorgeous, gorgeous girl. The phrase comes from an August TikTok, in which user @fishdress professed that “gorgeous, gorgeous girls love soup.” It went massively viral, and tons of people posted their own versions, with the expression becoming ubiquitous on Twitter as well.The markers of a gorgeous, gorgeous girl vary widely, but may include loving pickles, taking the train because they can’t drive, listening to Simple Plan, having stomach problems, adopting pit bulls, getting their booster shot, and pretending “to be Beth March dying of scarlet fever every time they’re near the sea.” Really, anyone can be a gorgeous, gorgeous girl if they decide they are one.28. Milk Crate Challenge
 


This is a challenge that probably shouldn’t have taken off the way it did. The Milk Crate Challenge involved stacking crates into a pyramid and scaling it — often to disastrous results. Doctors advised against it, with some telling the Washington Post they had treated patients who’d taken part.People would film themselves walking up the crates like stairs, but because of the lack of stability, many wound up brutally wiping out. Even so, people continued to attempt the challenge, and one woman even completed it in high heels.The internet did its bit to warn people of the danger, with the best meme PSA being, of course, the edit of “Jason Derulo” tumbling down the crates.29. I Know It Ain’t the Stallion
 


This meme comes from none other than the queen Keke Palmer, who was the red carpet presenter for Vogue at this year’s Met Gala. When Megan Thee Stallion walked up, she said, “Oh oh oh, I know it ain’t… I know it ain’t the staaallion… You know it's your girl!” and the rest was history.That audio really took off on TikTok when a user remixed it with a keyboard. The sound went viral, and users made their own versions in the same format. For example, “I know it ain’t the consequences of my actions,” which JoJo Siwa used.Palmer later addressed the meme in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. “Why am I at my job doing that?” she said. “I don’t know what it is with me.”30. Red Flags
 


The red flag meme is one of the few memes from this year that will definitely make it long term: It’s short, simple, and memorable. First started on Black Twitter with people naming obvious negative traits someone could have, it quickly escalated from actual red flags about a person to just straight-up jokes. Obviously brand accounts jumped on it like they would any good meme, with MTV getting ratioed hard for their own red flag attempt.31. The Girls That Get It, Get It
 


This came from a TikTok user by the name of @khaenotbae from a video she posted in November. In a comment underneath, she explained she was mimicking Flavor of Love’s Tiffany Pollard.People have used the sound in TikToks about little inside jokes or life hacks they swear by, such as tips for makeup or filming TikToks. Though her audio went viral, TikTok somehow removed her original video but the sound remained up.As the trend went on, some people started to use it for things that are either too basic or ridiculous, which has led to people criticizing the meme.In case the voice sounds familiar to you, the TikTok user responsible for this sound is also the mastermind behind: “And by the way, I have a question and don’t fight me because I know how you girls like to tussle.”32. Good Soup
 


“Good soup,” a meme for when the soup is good (shoutout to my gorgeous, gorgeous girls). The simple audio clip comes from one of the final episodes of Girls, in which Adam Driver and Lena Dunham decide to part ways. Punctuating the emotional conversation held in a diner booth, Driver eats a spoonful of soup, throws up the “OK” hand sign, and says “good soup.” Though the episode aired in 2017, it wasn’t until August that it made its way to TikTok, and it quickly became a huge meme used to all sorts of wacky ends.In an interview with Screenrant, Driver said he was aware of the meme but didn’t really get it. “I mean, like I understand what memes are, I guess, but it’s not something I keep track of or am tracking,” he said.No worries, Adam, that’s what we’re here for.

252,Remembering some of the people in the public eye who died this year.,"


2021 was a mix of ups and downs: leaving the house and then staying inside again, vaccines and variants. The year took a lot from us, as the pandemic continued and the number of people who died from COVID in the US alone surpassed 800,000 in December. Among those who have died in the past 12 months were some well-known figures, including Virgil Abloh and Michael K. Williams.Here's a look back at just a few of those in the public eye who died this year.

253,"Guardians who follow the rules can be very helpful for people with disabilities. But some people under guardianship have been abused, neglected, and killed.","


This is a plain language version of a story published earlier this year, adapted by Sandy Mislow of the Self-Advocacy Association of New York State.
 


BuzzFeed News did an investigation into guardianships. The reporters learned that guardianships have hurt many people with disabilities. Here are eight important facts that were found during the investigation.
 


1. America’s guardianship system is supposed to help protect people with disabilities who are unable to make decisions for themselves. However, more than 1 million adults are now under guardianship and are at risk of abuse, theft, and even death.
 


2. People under guardianship can permanently lose their right to vote, marry, start a family, decide where to live, agree to medical treatment, spend their money, look for jobs, or own property. They can also lose the right to hire a lawyer to fight for them, which means that once a guardianship is in place, it is often impossible to find freedom again.
 


3. Sometimes guardians are family members, but they can also be professionals with hundreds of people under their control.
 


4. The guardianship system is not always fair to people with disabilities. The guardians, lawyers, and experts may be paid with money belonging to the person with disabilities, even if that person doesn’t want a legal guardian. Also, the judges and lawyers often know each other and may not make fair decisions about the person with disabilities. Advertisement     
 


5. Guardians who follow the rules can be very helpful for people with disabilities. But some people under guardianship have been abused, neglected, and killed. Others have been locked up and kept away from their families and friends.
 


6. Some guardians take all the money from people’s bank accounts. Last year a guardian was charged with abuse and neglect of a person under her protection. Another person under guardianship was abused by his home care staff and died, and his guardian did not realize he was missing for several months after it happened.
 


7. There are no laws in the U.S. about guardianship, and there is no way to know exactly how many people are affected by it. BuzzFeed News believes that there could be 200,000 new guardianship cases in our country every year. Advertisement     
 


8. Judges are not supposed to put someone under guardianship without first thinking about other options, but sometimes that doesn’t happen. Young people with disabilities are often put under guardianship after graduating from school. The National Council on Disability calls this the “school-to-guardianship pipeline.” Sometimes parents do not understand how bad guardianship can be until it is too late to change it.

254,"All you need is an owl, a cassoulet, and the constant specter of looming death.","


The month before your 30th birthday has been an unrelenting onslaught of bad news. You try to keep your chin up because you love your birthday — you’re an Aquarius, but also a narcissist above all, so this should be your time. Instead, you feel like you’re pressing your forehead against very cold glass, waiting for it to shatter and cut you up into a million little pieces.You’re into your second year of quarantine thanks to a pandemic that you once dismissed as “just a bad flu.” Every day you take your stupid little depression walk with your stupid little mask, and you think about your stupid little brain and how, for a fleeting moment, it convinced you that this would be nothing. You haven’t seen your family or most of your friends since early 2020; you, a genius, opted to move to New York from Toronto a year before the pandemic hit, and now you feel trapped in a place that looks like home but feels completely foreign. When you google grocery stores (you don’t recognize any of the chains) to try to find bucatini, you just find a bodega that sells nothing but 6-year-old lime chips. Your niece calls you and tells you she’s been watching news clips of you online because she misses seeing your face and hearing your voice. You have never been punched in the nose with a closed fist (surprising, since you’ve often deserved it), but this is probably what it feels like. Advertisement  Every weekend, you sit in a transparent bubble built out of plastic and zippers, encircling a little patio table and chair and heater. Your ankles are on fire, your head is freezing cold. You’re too chilly — in every meaning of the word — to ever really enjoy the pleasure of getting drunk. You bring a Corpse Reviver No. 2 to your lips, shivering, and think, Yes, this is fine.Three weeks before your birthday, your Veena Masi dies in India, a country that once told you that you belonged there and then denied you a visa for entry, right before the pandemic hit. People tell you that the canceled trip was good news — “Imagine being stuck in India for all this!” It’s cold comfort — you’re sure you were denied because of an article you wrote a year earlier, critical of the Indian government and its handling of Kashmir, but you can’t even get any confirmation of this. Your aunt was a small, spry woman who spoke very little English but always held your hands in hers and told you that you look like your mother. She was a year younger than your mom, who calls you from Canada wailing into the phone. Her family is shrinking. She didn’t see this one coming. You want to run to her and make her chai and help manage your father, but you can’t, because there’s a pandemic, and accidentally killing your mother seems worse than just letting her suffer in front of you on FaceTime. “My childhood is gone,” she says. You’re quiet, and you listen, distinctly aware that your mother’s unbearable grief is but a reminder that your childhood, too, is slipping away.Your niece’s dog, Steven “Steve” Roger Koul, a miniature dachshund your brother got when you were in the 11th grade, is starting to slow down. He isn’t eating, he seems disoriented, and his face is mostly gray. Most of his teeth have been pulled, so now he peers around the room with his tongue hanging out of his mouth. It’s cute, but still a harbinger of doom. He’s an old man, but you’re hoping he can get through the year. You think about how you once took care of him for three weeks, and he kept leaping up on the kitchen counter to eat your lunches, day after day. You cry, because now he can’t really eat any sandwiches at all. Advertisement  Despite opening your laptop every day for 10 to 13 hours, you have made less than no progress on your book. You sold it a year before the pandemic compressed your life, a collection of essays about...what was it again? Fighting? Fights? Being an asshole? All three, maybe. But you have lost any sense of who you are, and such a thing makes writing about yourself impossible. When you read the thoughts of your own narrator, you think to yourself, God, I hate this woman. You wonder if you should give the money back to your publisher, or perhaps try to say something so inflammatory that they just cancel it themselves. (Written in your notebook during a brainstorm: “Do a murder? Be racist against an invented ethnic group? Try to get on Red Scare?”)You get a haircut because you want to feel better. It comes out looking like Steve chewed on your hair and left you with jagged ends. You call your friend Barb, who looks at you with her saddest eyes because she knows it’s beyond repair — that’s how you really know things are falling apart. You cry for three days while your husband, typically bold and confident, stands awkwardly at your bedroom door, looking at you, stricken. “But I like bangs,” he says, mostly to himself.
 


Steve has to be put down two weeks after Veena Masi’s death. Your niece is handling it better than any of the adults; she calls wearing a tiger onesie and plies you with platitudes. “He was old, Boo,” she says. “It was his time.” (She is still little enough to call you Boo — will that eventually change too?) She asks if you can still play video games together, a small reassurance that she’s malleable enough to not be forever embittered by this random, cruel moment in her life. Does everything really need to be taken away from this little girl, all at the same time? She’s in remote learning again, like children everywhere, and she hates it. She can’t even hug her grandparents, something she understands, but they somehow do not, despite being 60 years older than her. “Just one hug,” your dad tells her when she visits, outside, masked, many feet apart. “I’ll put a blanket on you and then hug you.”Your niece becomes incensed by your father’s disregard for the rules. “Don’t you get it?” she screams at him, her pink little face becoming red. “I could kill you!”Your mom’s older sister gets COVID, so she calls to talk about that, instead of the knee replacement she desperately needs. She texts you the crying-laughing emoji instead of the crying emoji, which for once, you can’t bring yourself to find very funny. Advertisement  What is a little funny is that turning 30 marks the end of other people thinking you’re exceptional. When you’re young and competent, people treat you like you’re some kind of wunderkind. It’s impressive that you can do your job, that you’re climbing out of debt, that you’re forming healthy relationships. But by the time you’re 30, you’re just doing what’s expected of you. It’s mundane, your semi-tidy apartment, your shelfful of books that visitors expect you to have actually read. That seems unfair. You realize that the next few years will be spent accepting that you’re no longer young enough to be considered interesting or compelling, and not old enough to have institutional power or an advanced sense of self-confidence. No one praises you for owning an iron anymore. Who will care about your average book at your average age?Your bangs continue to grow out, by which you mean horizontally. You look like a My Chemical Romance fan club president. You would like to die, but instead, you have to be grateful to not have the coronavirus, to have most of your family intact, to be healthy, to be alive. It’s a stupid fucking list — what kind of life is it to just have to be thankful for not losing it all the time? You grind your teeth so hard that the back of your front tooth chips. Instead of getting it fixed, you spend days rubbing your tongue against it until it bleeds.You post a photo of your bad haircut on Instagram in an attempt to make fun of yourself, the only way you know how to cope with a mild irritant. You end up hurting your own feelings when a stranger messages you, “I love mullets on brown women!” You delete the photo and write “FUCK” in a journal for seven pages. Advertisement  
 


So wrapped up in your own grief about the pandemic — and the idea of turning 30, which you have decided will remain just an idea, because you are not interested in actually turning 30 — you’re only startled back into being a person when your husband’s uncle and cousin die in quick succession. He spends hours on the phone with a family he can’t touch, all the cousins who look like shades of him. While he coughs through a tear, you angrily gaze at the small Hindu shrine you’ve built on your bookshelf. You’re not religious, but this year has made you desperate so you’ve taken to periodically lighting a candle at the feet of deities while offering various deals: If you don’t kill anyone, you can force me to keep this bad haircut indefinitely. If you make sure no one in my family gets hurt before we can see them again, you can put me in a little bit of debt. Not like Erika Jayne debt, though. Little debt. Cute debt. Debt I can joke about later.When your husband sleeps, you march up to the five of them. “I thought we had a deal? I thought lighting some nag champa and considering not eating meat on Tuesdays was the price??” They say nothing. You wonder if maybe you should join a cult instead. Advertisement  Your husband’s niece comes down with COVID, a result of still having to go to work through this collective year of agony. He frets about her quietly, how far she is from home too, how no one is there to take care of her. She’s in college, she should be out having fun. Like everything, this doesn’t feel fair either.The next week, you get your first American tax bill: an absolute assault of $10,000. You can pay it, but barely, in a way that brings your bank balance so low it makes you nauseous to look at your banking app. That same week, your husband’s niece and your aunt both recover within weeks of their first symptoms. You feel Lakshmi’s eyes on your back, her face cast in porcelain. You ask; I deliver.
 


Since the pandemic has halted largely everything about your life — except, allegedly, the passing of time — the biggest bash you can throw for your birthday is to drive upstate with your husband to a little house you’ve rented for a long weekend. It’s a brick cabin in a gated community, enshrined in ice after a few storms, which makes leaving the house a treacherous journey. The owner is a criminologist and former antiques dealer, giving the home a distinct “someone was murdered here” feel. The living room smells like mothballs and overflows with more rusty telescopes than you ever knew existed. One bookshelf is dedicated entirely to fragments of seashells. The kitchen is chaos; there’s a whole shelf just for gold-rimmed goblets, two AGA stoves that never turn off and rest at a fixed but indeterminate temperature, which makes cooking a bit of a magic trick. On the wall is an 1880s-era phone that doesn’t work, probably because the house doesn’t need you calling for help while the walls bleed and the home’s aura turns you inside out. It is a good place to contemplate your mortality. Advertisement  You tug on the cord leading to the attic and find two twin beds and a pile of furs. There are cabinets and closets with thick, impenetrable locks on them. This should be...fine.But who cares? This trip is for naught, because you’re not really turning 30. To turn 30 would suggest that the year you’ve spent in quarantine counted at all. It would suggest that time has been moving on as normal, which it clearly has not, evidenced by the fact that your body has not left your neighborhood in months. You entered the pandemic at the very beginning of your 29th year, so it’s impossible that you could be leaving it at 30 — or maybe even 31.You were raised in a family that required you to call every evening and use your vacation days to come home and visit. You’ve been calling, sure, but the conversations blend together, and there’s never any news, never any new stories to tell. You’re just happy your parents are alive and faking cheerfulness for your sake. No news, no progress, no time gone. So this isn’t really your 30th. You still have time to make it on a “30 Under 30” list, because this year doesn’t count. Advertisement  The day before your birthday, you rush to your husband excitedly with a plan. “Let’s do drugs tomorrow,” you say, hopping lightly on your toes while he toils away in the kitchen with the impossible stove that’s always on. He’s making cassoulet, the way your favorite restaurant in Toronto makes it. For days already, he’s been slow-cooking duck, simmering ragù, toasting bread crumbs, and braising sausage. “Do you really want to trip on your birthday?” he asks. Who knows. You mostly wanted to finish a book. But this is what young people do, and you are still young, because you are not yet 30.“We can,” your husband says, stirring the beans that have already been cooking for 16 hours. “But I made this big meal, and I want you to be able to enjoy it.” He looks at you worried and wounded that you’re tamping down your generally robust appetite. “You’re right,” you tell him with a quick kiss on the cheek, and let him go back to his beans. You spend some time in the attic excitedly looking for a body. You can only fight who you are for so long.
 


The morning of your birthday, you wake up and your husband presents you with videos from everyone you know and love, wishing you happy birthday from their little corners of the world, all huddled away from one another in case of death. He gets you an upsettingly overpriced hair dryer. You’re 30. It feels fine. When you post a photo of yourself on Instagram announcing your acceptance of this age, you’re feted with compliments about how “you look so much younger!” or “I thought you were older, you’re so accomplished!” Both are satisfying in different ways, and you bask like a pig in shit.Some of your best friends have scheduled a Zoom call for the afternoon. They’re your friends, but the closeness you feel with them even after exactly a year apart makes it feel like there should be a better word for them, one that contextualizes how they kept you alive during the nadir of your persistent depression.You chat with them for hours while draining a bottle of wine. Soon, you get sleepy and try to wind it down — everyone has virtual meeting fatigue, and you don’t want to make it worse for the faces you see in these little floating cubes, people who are similarly stuck in an emotional tundra, waiting for some kind of release. But suddenly, your friends all go on mute and start dropping off from the call, one by one. Then only Seb is left, and he peers at you while chewing on his nails. “I’ll send you a new link,” he says, disappearing himself. Advertisement  When you click on the new link, you’re transported to the University of Minnesota’s official Zoom account. A mistake? A prank, maybe? None of your friends are foolish enough to make such an error, and none of them are cruel enough to throw you into a first-year econ class on your birthday. But now you can make out the university’s Raptor Center. More importantly, you can see an owl called Ricky, who has rickets, who has been hired for your birthday to eat a mouse whole. Ricky gives you a little hoot and murders a mouse with three bites. It is horrific. You have never been so happy in your life. Imagine being so lucky that your friends — these people you met a decade ago, or even longer — know exactly what you want, which is to watch an owl choke down a mouse in your honor.The cassoulet is perfect. You have three servings. You and your husband sleep wrapped up together, like two trees that learned to grow around each other. Maybe it’s love, maybe you’re worried something is going to crawl out of the attic and kill you. Who cares. It’s a good feeling.Months later, when the ice melts, your friend Jenna holds your hand across a table at dinner in Bushwick and weeps about 30 being just around the corner for her. There were so many things she wanted to do before this birthday, so much taken from her in the last year and a half as well. She dabs at her impeccable eyeliner, stopping the bleed from running down her cheeks. “It’ll be OK,” you tell her, squeezing her hand in yours. “It’s just a birthday. How bad could it be?” Advertisement     Your niece gets a new dog, a little puppy she has named Beans. For years, you’ve been calling your niece Bean, and so now they are Bean and Beans, two little rats you love very much. Steve lives on in Beans’ shrieky bark and Bean’s unbridled happiness.You send a few pages of your book to your editor, finally, a year after she first emailed you waiting for a manuscript. “You’re right, they’re disjointed and stream of consciousness,” she tells you. “But there’s something there.” Are you relieved? Maybe — quitting altogether would’ve been nice, too.“I think the problem is you’re still writing like you did before the pandemic. And it’s not working because you’re not that person anymore. And I don’t know if you like the person you’ve become. How are you supposed to write about someone you don’t like?” You pull on the stack of new grey hairs you have sprouting from your temple.“For what it’s worth,” she finishes, “I like who you became. I think she’s great.” It’s been years since you’ve liked yourself, even longer since you’ve been able to verbalize it, but you did once, and maybe you can again. That afternoon, you sit with who you are now, and you get back to work. ● Advertisement

255,Student loan debt can follow people throughout their lives and lock them out of significant milestones like buying a home or obtaining a degree.,"



 


When the COVID pandemic first struck, Johanna Daile, a third-year student studying history and psychology at John A. Logan College in Carterville, Illinois, knew they would have trouble concentrating in virtual classes. Having already accumulated $58,000 of debt over three years of college, they decided to temporarily quit school during the pandemic to focus on paying back their loans.But the pandemic continued — and got worse. Daile, then an assistant manager at Dairy Queen, relocated to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, to be near family in September 2020. They transferred to another Dairy Queen location, working the same position for less pay. The 24-year-old switched jobs a few more times before finding their current position at Kay Jewelers.Because they did not graduate, Daile wasn’t able to get their loans deferred, and going back to school isn’t possible without taking out even more loans. Their payments are up to $750 per month — over half of their paycheck. They want to resume their education, but the risk of taking on even more debt severely limits their options, Daile told BuzzFeed News. Now their goal is to return to school by 2025, if they are able.Student loan debt is an overwhelming burden shared by over 40 million Americans. It can follow people throughout their lives and lock them out of significant milestones like buying a home or, in Daile’s case, obtaining a degree. Advertisement     Under the CARES Act, student loan repayments were paused, and the federal student loan interest rates were set at 0% as of March 2020. In August this year, a month before the pause was set to expire, President Joe Biden pushed the deadline to resume payments to Jan. 31, 2022.As COVID cases surged this past month, the president on Wednesday announced that he would extend the pause to May 1, 2022. But Biden — who promised on the campaign trail to forgive $10,000 in student loan debt per borrower — has not indicated that he will cancel student debt outright, as progressive lawmakers have demanded, a move that would provide immense financial relief to millions of Americans.In his announcement of the extension, Biden acknowledged the difficulties that over 40 million borrowers have faced during the pandemic.“Now, while our jobs recovery is one of the strongest ever — with nearly 6 million jobs added this year, the fewest Americans filing for unemployment in more than 50 years, and overall unemployment at 4.2 percent — we know that millions of student loan borrowers are still coping with the impacts of the pandemic and need some more time before resuming payments,” Biden said in his Dec. 22 statement.Biden also promised that the Department of Education would offer support programs in the meantime and to help borrowers make payments come May 2022. But many borrowers told BuzzFeed News the extension doesn’t remotely solve the dire financial issue of $1.7 trillion owed in US student loan debt (including federal and nonfederal loans).“I just wish that it could help those who cannot afford to finish their education and those with private student loans because it was their only choice,” Daile said. “Adults in [the] upper-middle class and upper class can survive, but lower-middle class to low class, we are barely surviving with our payments.”
 


Student loan debt is just not a problem for millennials, according to Alan Collinge, founder of StudentLoanJustice.org, a group that advocates for total cancellation. More than half of all borrowers are over 35 years old, according to Department of Education data from 2020. Older people owe more than younger people, even though they may have borrowed less money initially years ago, Collinge said in the group’s response to Biden’s extension this week.BuzzFeed News reached out to members of the “Student Loan Justice” Facebook group, where borrowers share their stories and support one another. Many of them reacted to Biden administration’s recent extension with deeply personal stories.Kristina Allen, 52, lives near San Francisco and has one more online class to earn a bachelor’s degree in nursing from Regis University. She initially took loans out when she began studying to become a registered nurse as her twin daughters attended college. She graduated in 2008.
 


“I was a single mom in poverty, and I desperately wanted my twins and their little sister to have a better life,” Allen said, adding that her three daughters are all college graduates now. “My granddaughter doesn't know what hungry is, so the cycle of poverty stopped.”Over the years, Allen has paid off $90,000 in loans but still owes about $75,000; her initial loan was less than half that amount. Between 2015 and 2016, around her third year of the bachelor’s program at Regis, Allen defaulted on her federal loans and was charged exorbitant interest and fees. She‘s also subjected to a wage garnishment, which means a percentage of her disposable income is being withheld until her loan is paid off or considered not in default. One-quarter of her pretax income has been garnished since 2017 until the first pause in loan repayment came during the Trump administration, she said.Biden’s announcement of a loan repayment extension came as a relief. But once payments restart in the spring, Allen believes she’ll have to “drop her dream” of a master’s degree to focus paying off her loans with the wage garnishment.“Retirement? A home of our own? Not even a thought,” Allen, who said she has lupus and a related blood clot disorder, told BuzzFeed News. The repayment pause has given her a much-needed financial break to afford care for her husband, who has end-stage cancer, as well as address her own health issues she’s neglected. But, Allen said, she can’t afford to move closer to family and friends in New England; she needs her current work-provided health insurance to pay for her husband’s chemotherapy, support herself, and pay the loans.“I'd like to work less and take care of my own health, but I can't, because of my loans,” Allen said.Like Allen, Michael Goolsby, a 56-year-old who works at a Walmart in Fernley, Nevada, said Biden’s new deadline will postpone his wage garnishment; he told BuzzFeed News that, since 2019, 15% of his paycheck has been withheld to pay off his loans. Goolsby has a bachelor’s and master’s in history from Colorado State University; when he finished his master’s in 1991, he had $25,000 in student loan debt.The following year, he was told he faced a default. As a result, his school would not release his transcripts to potential employers, he said. He accepted an offer in early 1994 to consolidate his debt under a Sallie Mae program, which required him to take out a $36,000 loan. But multiple payment deferments and defaults only compounded his debt, causing him to fall behind no matter how much he worked, he said, ultimately leading to a wage garnishment. He said he’s trying to keep other debts down so he can eventually declare bankruptcy.His student loan debt now stands at more than $100,000, he said.“I did many things over time for a job, from driving a truck, managing a fast-food restaurant, working on an assembly line, being a paralegal for a San Francisco law firm for six years, working in IT doing technical support for 15 years, and then driving a cab and leaving California for Reno, Nevada, because that's where the jobs are nowadays as I work towards retirement, which may not even be on my 65th birthday in 2030,” Goolsby said. “But here I am.”
 


Justin Schanck, 43, a teacher in Macon, Georgia, said he owes $80,000 in loans from his combined graduate and undergraduate degrees.“I went to grad school to try and better my life and increase my income, only to add on more loans,” he told BuzzFeed News. Schanck said he blames himself for not thinking about the cost of a graduate degree, “but this predatory lending system certainly did not help.”Not using his hard-earned money to pay off his loans during the pandemic has allowed his family to “reinvest” in his community, he said. They put a new roof on their house to stop a ceiling leak and have been determined to shop from local businesses.“Once the payments start again, that money will essentially be taken away from the local economy,” Schanck said.Yirzely Villanueva, 27, of Canyon Country, California, said she feels both “relieved and stressed'' by the extension. She told BuzzFeed News she has over $40,000 in debt from a master’s degree in teaching from the University of Southern California. She said she’s happy that interest is paused for now and she can pay back “exactly” what she borrowed.“My loan is 60% of my savings and so I'm stuck,” she said. “I either pay off my loan and stay broke, or wait and be in debt indefinitely.”As a Mexican American woman, Villanueva said she feels like the “deck is already stacked” against her when it comes to taking out loans for a home or a car. “With my luck, I'm scared once I hit ‘pay’ [my student loans] will be canceled.”She said the extension makes her wonder why borrowers aren’t being allowed to just pay back their loans without interest.“I feel like I'm just stuck in a horror movie waiting for the ‘interest monster’ to get me,” she said.
 


Like others, Lyndsey Summers, a 31-year-old in Portland, Oregon, said the extension is not enough. “I can’t say I’m unhappy about this extension, but it’s hardly enough for the millions of borrowers suffering,” Summers told BuzzFeed News.She said she owes nearly $75,000 from her bachelor’s degree in communication media from Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania. She’s had trouble qualifying for public loan forgiveness and said she “struggles to get by” given her loans and her salary as a journalist. She said it’s been difficult trying to talk to the government and her loan servicer, with long hold times on the phone.“It is the servicer who works with borrowers, and when you ask them for specific information, they point to the school,” Summers said. “The schools don’t have to keep records, by the way, for longer than 5 years — at least according to my institution. I wanted to see an itemized receipt for how my loans were applied to my education. I have no idea if I’ll get an answer. It would have been nice to be notified that records would be destroyed.”Although state schools are “supposed to be more affordable,” Summers pointed out, it wasn’t for her. “I just want to be able to buy a home and get ahead.”Amy (who asked that BuzzFeed News only use her first name for privacy), 55, is a former teacher in Louisiana. She said she originally borrowed $46,000 when she started her undergraduate degree in 1997; after “faithfully” paying off the loans for nearly two decades, she still owes $30,800.
 


“I owe almost as much now as I borrowed, even after 20 years of payments!” Amy told BuzzFeed News. “I have resigned to the fact that I will never in my lifetime be able to pay them off. I will take them to my grave.”Amy said she has applied for teacher forgiveness programs in the past but has always been denied. “I really thought President Biden would follow through with his promises to help Americans such as myself that have been taken advantage of by a predatory loan system,” she said. “It looks like I was wrong.”
 



"
256,Judges are figuring out in real time what the consequences should be for storming the Capitol on Jan. 6.,"


Join HuffPost and BuzzFeed News for a Twitter Spaces conversation about how the Capitol riot is still altering US politics on Jan. 4 at 1 p.m. ET. Sign up to be notified when the Space begins here.
 


WASHINGTON — What is the punishment for someone who admits they joined in on an attack on democracy?For Jordan Stotts of Minnesota, it was two years on probation, with two months of tighter limits on when he can leave home. He scaled a wall to join the breach of the US Capitol, was captured on camera shouting at officers in the rotunda, and vowed to return, posting on Facebook: “Patriots! I got kicked out but I’ll be back!”For Lori and Thomas Vinson of Kentucky, it was five years on probation plus a $5,000 fine. Prosecutors had wanted jail time for Lori — she told an interviewer after she was fired from her job for participating in the riot, “I would do it again tomorrow” — but a judge didn’t agree.For Boyd Camper of Montana, it was two months in jail. As he joined the mob streaming into the building, he filmed his trek on a GoPro. He told a news crew outside later, “We’re going to take this damn place.”The task of fashioning justice for people who admitted to participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection has fallen to 22 judges on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The court’s members — a mix of Democrat and Republican appointees — have made clear they believe the assault on the Capitol was serious and violent, and that people convicted of crimes deserve punishment. They just don’t agree on what it should be. Advertisement  Some judges have bristled that prosecutors struck plea deals for low-level misdemeanors that limit the sentences they can impose. Some have imposed sentences that were harsher than the government’s recommendation; others have been more lenient. Some have questioned the varying sentences proposed by prosecutors across a spectrum of Capitol rioters who pleaded guilty to the same offense.It is “no wonder,” US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell said at an October sentencing, that some people “are confused about whether what happened on Jan. 6 was a petty offense of trespassing or shocking criminal conduct that represented a grave threat to our democratic norms.”Judges have had no patience for Donald Trump supporters trying to use the courthouse as a forum to relitigate President Joe Biden’s win in 2020. But the lack of consensus on the bench about what exactly justice should look like for each person who joined the mob mirrors a lack of consensus nationwide about how to think about the insurrection and its aftermath.The most common sentence has been probation, with a short period of home confinement or a fine mixed in, according to BuzzFeed News’ tracking of every prosecution filed in the year since the Jan. 6 attack. Probation means people can mostly return to their normal lives, with conditions — they have to regularly report to a probation officer, get permission to travel, submit to a home inspection at any time, and hold a job. They can’t have guns or other weapons. Violating probation by committing new crimes or failing to comply with other terms is a standalone crime that can be prosecuted. Advertisement  Nearly all of the 71 defendants sentenced as of the end of December pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, with most deals featuring the same charge: illegally parading in the Capitol, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $5,000 fine.In more than half of these misdemeanor sentencings, judges ordered punishments that were lighter than what the government argued for in terms of jail or home detention. Two-thirds of defendants sentenced for misdemeanor pleas didn’t receive any jail time.If you have more information about Jan. 6 or the legal fights in its aftermath, contact this reporter at zoe.tillman@buzzfeed.com, or see other ways to send tips here.Prosecutors have not charged everyone accused of descending on the Capitol with felonies that reflect the political nature of the overarching criminal event, which temporarily halted Congress’ certification of the election and the peaceful transfer of power. No one has been charged with sedition or insurrection, both rarely brought offenses. A top Justice Department official said early on that sedition was being explored for “the most heinous acts,” along with conspiracy; more than 50 people have been charged with that latter crime.Of the 700-plus people charged so far, BuzzFeed News’ analysis shows that just over half are facing at least one felony. The most common felony count is for obstructing an official proceeding; those cases have tended to involve some specific evidence that defendants were actively trying to disrupt the special session of Congress, such as making it to the floor of the Senate or expressing their intent in interviews or online. The obstruction offense has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, although nonviolent, first-time offenders are likely to face far less than that, and prosecutors have already agreed to let some defendants plead down to a misdemeanor. There are also felony cases pending against people charged with assaulting police, carrying or using weapons, and civil disorder. Advertisement  Everyone else is being hit solely with misdemeanor charges for illegally being in the Capitol, disorderly conduct, and parading, a collection of counts carrying maximum penalties between six months to a year in jail. The US attorney’s office in Washington focused plea offers this year on the less serious cases with lower stakes. It’s a strategy that not only clears cases and frees up resources, but also is in keeping with broader trends across the US justice system, where the overwhelming majority of criminal cases end in plea bargains.This process means that justice for an attack on democracy is filtering through a criminal justice system largely built around agreements that are hammered out in secret between the accused (the rioters) and the accusers (the prosecutors), and sentences crafted by a single judge. The riot was the violent culmination of a monthslong effort led by Trump and his supporters to undo millions of votes cast in a presidential election, but there’s little to no opportunity for public input on the consequences for people who participated.
 


Judges have talked from the bench about the challenge of applying the normal rules to an unprecedented event like Jan. 6. They’ve explained that they have to treat each defendant as an individual and can’t punish them for the full spectrum of criminal activity committed at the Capitol.With most defendants admitting to the same misdemeanors on paper, judges are picking apart the details of their words and actions as compared to other rioters. They’re weighing how those details make a person more or less individually responsible for the threat — potential or actualized — posed by the mob.How many minutes did a defendant spend in the Capitol? Did they walk through a breached door or climb through a broken window? Where did they go? How far inside did they travel? Did they capture photos or video? Did they take selfies, and did they look happy to be there? Did they witness violence or vandalism and keep going? Did they publicly brag about it online, or only send messages to friends and family, and does that distinction matter? Is the remorse they expressed later legitimate or are they just sorry they got caught, and, really, how can anyone know for sure?And the big question that’s loomed over the conclusion of each of these cases: Is there any sentence that could dissuade people from storming the Capitol in January 2025 if they disagree with the results of the next presidential election? Advertisement  For some judges, the obvious answer is jail. In the handful of cases where a defendant has pleaded guilty to a felony like assaulting police or obstructing Congress, judges have imposed months or years of prison. The length of incarceration in misdemeanor cases may be short by comparison, but judges have said they hope the threat of any loss of liberty scares off other people, disappointed or furious when the candidate they supported loses an election, from taking matters into their own hands.US District Judge Tanya Chutkan has emerged as an early proponent of time behind bars for misdemeanor offenders. At a sentencing in early October, she ordered Matthew Mazzocco of Texas to spend 45 days in jail, becoming the first judge to go above the amount of time the government recommended. She chastised Mazzocco for treating the riot like “entertainment” — he’d posted a celebratory selfie in front of the Capitol on Facebook with the caption, “The capital is ours!” and took photos of himself smiling inside and outside the building — and said a harsher sentence was needed as a warning to others.“There have to be consequences for participating in an attempted violent overthrow of the government, beyond sitting at home,” Chutkan said at the time. Advertisement  Other judges aren’t convinced that time behind bars is justified for people pleading guilty to low-level, nonviolent crimes, or if a relatively short stint in jail is even the most effective way to make the punishment “hurt,” in the words of one judge. They’ve crafted sentences featuring combinations of probation, fines, home detention, computer monitoring, social media restrictions, mental health treatment, job training, and community service.With new cases being filed every week, 71 sentences is too small a number to confirm patterns for how the rest of these cases will play out. There’s too little data, for instance, to say whether the political pathways that judges took to the bench manifest in the sentences they hand down. Judges nominated by presidents of both parties, including Trump, have mixed records of ordering jail versus probation for Capitol rioters. But most judges have only presided over a handful of sentencings, and some judges haven’t sentenced anyone yet.Still, enough cases have reached the final phase to understand what judges are thinking about as they mete out justice. They’re aware of the intense media coverage of these cases and the fact that the court allows the public to dial in to hear live audio of most hearings, a pandemic-related expansion of access. They’re keeping an eye on the investigation into Jan. 6 that’s unfolding in Congress, and they’re paying close attention to what their colleagues are doing — sometimes publicly signaling when they agree or disagree with another judge’s decision or comments.There was the case where US District Judge Trevor McFadden accused the Justice Department of not being “even-handed” in its response to Jan. 6 compared to the protests last summer against racism and police brutality — comments that prompted Chutkan in another case to say she disagreed with McFadden, calling it a “false equivalence.” It was one of the few times where the broader political discourse seemed to seep into public exchanges among judges; McFadden was nominated by Trump, Chutkan by former president Barack Obama. There was the case where US District Judge Rudolph Contreras accused prosecutors of ramping up their sentencing recommendations because they were yelled at by another judge. Advertisement  Several judges have expressed concern about the case of Anna Morgan-Lloyd, who made an emotional plea for leniency to US District Judge Royce Lamberth and received probation. Morgan-Lloyd then went on Fox News the day after her sentencing and made comments that seemed to minimize the violence at the Capitol. Morgan-Lloyd’s lawyer has insisted her client got “played” by Fox and was honest with Lamberth, but judges have held up her case as a cautionary tale against giving too much weight to after-the-fact expressions of remorse.Lamberth, meanwhile, has made it known that he felt burned by Morgan-Lloyd. When Frank Scavo of Pennsylvania came before the judge last month after pleading guilty to the same parading misdemeanor, Lamberth blew past the two-week jail sentence that the government argued for, sentencing Scavo to 60 days.A few judges have complained that charging decisions by prosecutors tied their hands in crafting sentences.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson has questioned prosecutors about the wisdom of entering plea deals for a misdemeanor that restricted the options that judges had for ordering extended court supervision. US District Judge Carl Nichols expressed the same concern at a November sentencing for David Mish of Wisconsin, saying he was “very torn” because he thought Mish could benefit from longer-term contact with the court. Nichols ended up sending Mish to jail for 30 days, citing his previous criminal record as well as the need to deter others. Advertisement  
 


It’s not the first time that federal judges in Washington have been faced with novel questions of law with massive implications for the legitimacy of the US government and its institutions. The court has presided over legal entanglements from some of the biggest political scandals in modern history — Watergate, Whitewater and the Clinton affair, the Russia probe — as well as the crush of cases filed by people captured in the War on Terror after 9/11 challenging their indefinite detention at the US military installation in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.The sheer number of Jan. 6 cases sets this prosecution effort apart. A prosecutor recently said in court that the government believed that 2,000 to 2,500 people illegally went inside the Capitol, far more than the estimate of 800 people that a US Capitol Police official gave Congress early on. Prosecutors and Justice Department officials haven’t said if there’s a target number for when they’ll end the investigation. Advertisement  The seven people sentenced for felonies have all received prison time. Paul Hodgkins of Florida, who pleaded guilty to obstructing Congress, had tried to argue for no time behind bars since he hadn’t engaged in violence or destruction; he went onto the Senate floor and carried a “TRUMP” flag. US District Judge Randolph Moss said probation wasn’t an option and ordered him to spend eight months in prison, less than the 18 months sought by prosecutors. It was a benchmark-setting hearing that spelled bad news for any defendant hoping to stay out of prison with a felony plea deal.People needed to know that assaulting the Capitol and interfering with the democratic process “will have severe consequences,” the judge said at the time.Of the 64 people sentenced for a misdemeanor offense, 36 — more than half — received sentences that were lighter than what the government recommended as far as loss of liberty, according to BuzzFeed News’ analysis. That included 14 cases where judges rejected the government’s recommendation of prison time altogether, nine cases where judges ordered a period of incarceration that was shorter than the government’s request, and 13 cases where judges didn’t agree with the government’s recommendation of a short period of home confinement as a condition of probation.
 


Forty defendants who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors — roughly two-thirds — avoided time behind bars, receiving home confinement and probation, or probation alone.The remaining 24 misdemeanor offenders were incarcerated. Nine people received prison sentences that were more severe than what the government requested, with judges either going above the amount of incarceration prosecutors asked for or rejecting a recommendation of probation. Nine people received prison sentences that fell below the government’s recommendation, and six received time behind bars that matched the government’s request.Jail sentences for misdemeanor offenders have ranged from as short as 14 days to as long as six months, although in the two cases to hit that high end the defendants already had been in jail after their arrests and were sentenced to the time they’d served.US District Judge Thomas Hogan ordered Robert Reeder to spend three months in jail, less than the six months prosecutors argued for after new evidence emerged that he’d been involved in a physical confrontation with police. Hogan said he wanted his sentence to signal that other rioters should expect jail time. But he explained that he didn’t think six months was appropriate because Reeder didn’t have a previous criminal record and the judge wasn’t sold that the evidence showed Reeder deliberately struck an officer with his fist. Advertisement     The person-specific facts of each case make it hard to do apples-to-apples comparisons, but some cases feature similar overarching narratives. Russell Peterson of Pennsylvania livestreamed on Facebook — “The Capitol is ours right now,” he said at one point — and prosecutors accused him of downplaying the violence afterward. The government asked for two weeks in jail. Jackson sentenced him to 30 days. Prosecutors wanted 60 days in jail for Glenn Croy of Colorado, arguing he’d entered the Capitol twice, treated the breach like a “vacation” by taking and posing for photos, and sent messages after that disputed the level of violence. Howell sentenced him to three months of home confinement and three years of probation.Howell has used some of the strongest language this year denouncing the insurrection and questioning prosecutors’ decision not to press more serious charges against participants. But in several misdemeanor cases, she’s rejected the government’s jail recommendations, pointing to other cases where prosecutors asked for probation for rioters who pleaded guilty to the same crimes and saying she also had an obligation to avoid “unwarranted” differences. She blasted the government’s “muddled” approach and blamed prosecutors for undercutting their own efforts.Howell’s sentences have included a period of home confinement and probation for Jack Griffith, a Tennessee man who was recorded on video screaming in excitement as he entered the Capitol and whose extensive social media posts afterward suggested a lack of remorse. Prosecutors had asked for three months of incarceration. As part of his sentence, Howell ordered the probation office to monitor his computer activity and barred him from using any social media platforms without getting permission first. Advertisement     Some judges have turned to hitting people’s pockets. In 16 cases, judges ordered defendants to pay fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 as an additional penalty beyond probation or jail; in 13 of those cases, the sentences were otherwise lighter than the government’s recommendation.Fines levied by judges are on top of agreements defendants have made to pay restitution to the US government as part of their plea deals — $500 for a misdemeanor plea, and $1,000 to $2,000 for a felony plea. Between fines ordered by judges and restitution agreements, the 160-plus rioters who have entered guilty pleas owe $148,500, roughly 10% of the nearly $1.5 million that the government has estimated in damage to the Capitol.
 


When US District Judge Reggie Walton sentenced the Vinsons, overruling the government’s request for jail time for Lori Vinson, he explained that one reason for that was he didn’t think the cost of incarcerating her was worth it. He said that he’d rather have the couple contribute toward the cost of repairing the Capitol and jail would only delay their ability to do that. Advertisement     “​​I want the sentence to hurt, because people have to understand that if you do something like this, it’s going to hurt,” Walton said, ordering them each to pay $5,000.Walton took the same approach this month in sentencing Anthony Mariotto of Florida. The prosecutor asked for four months of incarceration, arguing his misdemeanor case was more serious because of how far he’d made it into the building — he posted a selfie on Facebook from the Senate gallery, smiling, with a caption that included, “This is our house” — and the fact that he recorded assaults on police, knocked on doors, and seemed to minimize his role in an interview later.Walton sentenced Mariotto to pay a $5,000 fine and spend three years on probation. The judge said he believed that participating in the insurrection was a serious enough offense to merit incarceration. But he said he also didn’t think it was realistic to try to jail every defendant, and that it wouldn’t be appropriate since other defendants who pleaded guilty to the same crime received probation.Some judges have used the public platform they have at these sentencing hearings to make their feelings about what happened on Jan. 6 known. They’ve emphasized the seriousness of the insurrection, disputed narratives that have sprung up among right-wing politicians and pundits that rioters were “tourists” or that incarcerated defendants are “political prisoners,” and called out some of the bold-face names who haven’t been criminally charged — Trump and his allies who promoted the lie that the 2020 election was stolen (and continue to do so). Advertisement     When US District Judge Rudolph Contreras earlier this month rejected the government’s request for jail time for Felipe Marquez of Florida, the judge explained that he believed Marquez would be better served by home confinement and probation, plus a set of additional conditions including mental health treatment, job training, and other support. The judge said that Jan. 6 was the result of an “unprecedented” series of events, spurred on by Trump and his allies who “bear much responsibility” for what happened.At a sentencing in November, US District Judge Amit Mehta said that defendant John Lolos of Washington state was “a pawn in a game that’s played and directed by people who should know better.” Prosecutors wanted 30 days in jail for Lolos, who entered the Capitol through a broken window, chanted in support of the mob as he walked through the building, and yelled, “They left! We did it!” as he left. He came to law enforcement’s attention when he was kicked off a plane after the riot for being disruptive and chanting, “Trump 2020!” Mehta sentenced him to 14 days.“People like Mr. Lolos were told lies and falsehoods and told that an election was stolen when it clearly was not,” Mehta said. “Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos for whatever reason are impressionable and will believe such falsehoods and such lies ... and they are the ones who are suffering the consequences.” Advertisement     No judge has found that individual rioters weren’t culpable because they were corrupted by online conspiracy theories or inspired by Trump.“No one was swept away to the Capitol,” Jackson said at Russell Peterson’s sentencing this month. “No one was carried. The rioters were adults. And this defendant, like hundreds of others, walked there on his own two feet and he bears responsibility for his own actions. There may be others who bear greater responsibility and who also must be held accountable, but this is not their day in court, it is yours.” ●

257,"Due to the pandemic, certain milestones and accomplishments we might have otherwise reached continue to evade us, and might still for years to come.","


As we head into yet another holiday season marked by the uncertainty and dread of an ongoing pandemic, I’ve been trying to count my blessings. None of my loved ones have died of COVID. I have a job, a cozy home, and my health (physical, if not mental 🥴). In the grand scheme of things, I am absurdly lucky.But I also can’t help but reflect upon everything we’ve missed out on these last two years. Most of what I’ve lost — what we have all lost — is time. Precious, precious time. For me, that’s meant time with my fiancé, who’s only just been able to get back into the US from her native England after a year and a half of travel bans. Other families across the country and around the world have been robbed of time with elderly relatives in the last months of their lives, or the first few months or years with loved ones’ newborns.Soon, we’ll all be a couple of years older than we were when this all began, but it doesn’t necessarily feel that way — in part because certain milestones and accomplishments we might have otherwise reached continue to evade us, and might still for years to come. Advertisement  I wondered how other people might be grappling with these kinds of losses, especially because they’re more amorphous than the chilling finality of death. The social scientist Pauline Boss calls those unclear and often unacknowledged absences in our lives “ambiguous loss”: the result of “an accumulation of heartbreaks that we cannot always recognize,” as Meg Bernhard put it in a December New York Times profile of the emeritus professor. Boss has recently broadened the scope of her work to “questions of societal bereavement” during this time of “atmospheric grief.”Rose Gulati, a 22-year-old living in Toronto, was one of over a hundred people to respond to a BuzzFeed News survey last month about coping with these ambiguous losses. The pandemic began when she was halfway through her third year in university. Now that Gulati is “single, out of school and studying nothing,” she said she feels “robbed” of the time she lost. “Time at university, time with my friends, time to grow into myself. My transition from vibrant, defiant student to stay-at-home adult happened so quickly that I didn’t have time to grieve what I had lost,” she said. “I don’t go to drag shows or protests anymore. I watch TV to amuse myself and stay up late just to feel like I have something to do. The pandemic took away everything that made life fun and worthwhile.”“In a lot of ways, I’m still 20,” Gulati continued. “In others, I’ve lived through the monotony of life and I’m dead.” Advertisement  Death was a recurrent and troubling theme across multiple respondents’ answers. “I feel like I lost two years of my life and now I’m closer to death!” said Juliana Bruno, a 50-something in southern California who works in academia.“I’ve become acutely aware of my mortality and how my time here is truly limited,” Gulati said. “I’ve tried to make peace with death. All of these things that are supposed to come up with life are coming up for me now, because I feel like I’ve lived my life and I’m done with it. The pandemic has turned life into a passive activity of waiting to die. I’m not really alive, I’m just waiting.”Now that the Omicron variant has plunged much of the world into yet another wave of ambiguity and doubt, Gulati is far from alone when it comes to the sense of living in a perpetual state of limbo.“I feel like it's hard to make plans at all now,” said Christina Marfice, 31, a marketing strategist in Chicago. “Everything feels tenuous all the time, like we're constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. I've found it's better for my mental health to make no plans at all than to try to plan things and have them be canceled or changed, so I've been living in this indefinite holding pattern since early 2020. It's like life is on pause right now with no indication of when it might start moving forward again.”“Quite honestly, I can't imagine what my life will be like next August, much less five or ten years from now,” said a 22-year-old student in Utah who asked that their name be withheld from this story for privacy. “I've invested too much hope only to be burned. I'm not going to hold stock in the future anymore.” Advertisement  
 


The pandemic has made it rudely clear that none of us are getting any younger.Many of my fellow millennials, as well as Gen Zers, feel like they’re losing or have already lost the best years of their youth — and the promises that those years were supposed to hold.“I feel like I’m on some sort of time limit to have fun, and that I’m failing to meet that goal before time runs out,” said Becca Lo Presti, a recent college grad living in Vermont who never imagined spending the glory years of her 20s in a pandemic. “I don’t have the time to be carefree or take adventures. I feel 42, not 22.”“I've moved home and turned 30 while living in my parents’ basement — something that I vowed would never happen,” said Allison Weiner, a marketing coordinator in Rochester, New York. “Now I'm stuck playing family game night instead of playing out my ever-dwindling youth.” Advertisement  “I lost out on so much of my young adulthood,” said Holly Seibold, 24, a fiber artist in Tempe, Arizona. “I thought I would be dating and partying while making friends and putting roots down as I figured out what I want to do long term. I’m currently not doing any of those things.”Dozens of respondents also cited dating and relationships as things they’ve missed out on these last two years.
 


“I feel like the pandemic really hindered my romantic life,” said Michelle Vizzi, a 30-year-old lawyer in New York City. “I broke up with my boyfriend in December 2019 and was just starting to date again when the pandemic hit. I dated a little during the pandemic but I just felt like I lost so much time. And then suddenly I was 30. And do you know what no one warned me about turning 30 as a straight woman? That suddenly the number of likes/matches/etc. you get drops significantly. So many guys have their parameters set to stop at 29. I feel like I lost my last 2 ‘good years’ and now I have so few choices. I always thought that by 30 I would be in a long-term committed relationship and now I'm lucky if I get a match on a dating app. It's really depressing.”“I am looking to settle down, find a life partner, buy a house and stop living with my parents,” said Rachel Lalli, 28, who builds homes in Hanover, Massachusetts. “I have little to no social life and have grown very distant from old college and high school friends. I am now left to wonder how and when I will find my person. Will the world be in a better place?”Dating is one of the first pandemic losses that comes to mind for that 22-year-old student in Utah, where coming out, they said, “is still a dangerous endeavor.” Their university doesn’t have on-campus housing. “I've been living in off-campus apartments approved for BYU-Mormon university, pioneer of electroshock conversion therapy, and home to recent homophobic remarks by church leaders about ‘musket fire’ against queer people,” they said. “I haven't gone on a single date since moving here. I expected by this point in my life to have had at least one serious relationship.”Delays in dating have also meant, for many people, delays in starting a family.“Before the pandemic, I had one friend who had a baby,” said Reaganne Hansford, a 25-year-old speechwriter in Washington, DC. “Now, I have at least 10 friends with babies they had during the pandemic. I don’t know if their timelines were accelerated by the pandemic, but as someone who was NOT ready to have kids 2 years ago (and still don’t feel ready) it has made having kids really heavy on my mind lately. I ask myself if I just don’t want to be left behind by everyone else, but it has made me reevaluate what I want out of the rest of my 20s.”Some people — myself included — are questioning whether to have children at all.“I’ve wanted nothing more than to be a mom my whole life,” Lalli said. “But should I be bringing more people into this messed up world? Is climate change going to end us? Is it going to get so bad as to the point where we are all fighting for our lives again? I know it’s hard to say, so I keep living for a better day.”
 


“I've stopped thinking about possibly having kids someday, because it feels so impossible as a female-identifying person to go through that with American healthcare and laws being how they are,” said Jessica Clair, a 28-year-old living in the DC area. “I also can't imagine bringing a kid into this shitshow — that just feels insanely unfair now.”“2020 was supposed to be the year that my husband and I would start our journey to becoming parents,” said Teresa Martinez, 33, who manages a medical office in southern California. “We had previously put those plans on hold due to familial obligations. His grandma got sick and passed in 2018. My father was diagnosed with cancer in late 2018. It took a toll on us to take on additional responsibilities with our families during this time [and] we made the decision to hold off on trying for a few years to focus on our families.”After getting vaccinated, “we considered trying again,” Martinez said, “but we have seen so much in the last 2 years that it made us really stop to think, do we want to subject a child to this world we live in? Broken healthcare system in the US, broken political system, a capitalistic society in which people of average incomes are unable to afford the cost of living, the rampant racism that exists in this world, etc. Is it responsible to bring a child into this world?”It isn’t only the potential for future families that people have given up on. Many who wrote in noted that they’ve given up relationships with current family members over the past two years because of fundamental disagreements about COVID safety.Rachel Friedrick, a 31-year-old writer in Traverse City, Michigan, had her first child, a daughter, in October 2020. “Aside from their initial visit when she was born, we didn’t see family for the first 6+ months of her life, until the family could get vaccinated,” she said. Some family members understood while the decision to keep loved ones away ruptured other relationships completely. “My husband is a pediatrician and saw Covid patients, so we lived in constant fear that he might bring Covid home to our daughter unknowingly. I struggled through an incredibly isolating maternity leave alone, without friends or family, and then returned to my remote work trying to figure out how to balance working with a baby that refused a bottle and wanted to be fed at the breast every 2 hours. The first 6 months of my daughter’s life were some of the most lonely, isolated, and difficult days of my husband and I’s life.“I feel such loss around the entire experience of becoming a parent,” Friedrick continued. “Memories like my baby’s first Christmas only bring up loneliness and pain, especially because of the family relationships that were broken.”“When you work in healthcare and are seeing people dying daily in the midst of a pandemic, it becomes difficult to maintain relationships with people who are spreading false narratives about the ‘plandemic,’” Martinez said. She lost multiple friends and family members due to COVID-19: some of them died of it, and others got swept up in misinformation. “Even when trying to explain the reality of the situation, people choose to not believe,” she said. “Rather than stress myself out trying to show reality, it was easier to just step away from these relationships and focus on my own mental and physical health.”
 


On the flipside, when the future seems uncertain, we can better appreciate how precious time really is. The pandemic has forced many of us to consider how we want to spend our remaining days — because they are limited, and because they are all we have.For many people, that has meant a radical reconsideration of their relationship with work.“My life is more than half over and I fucking wasted it on stupid beliefs that I had to give 110% to ‘the man,’” said Bruno, the 50-something in southern California. “I should have been doing all that for me — not stupid work that wouldn’t even send flowers if I died tomorrow.”“My professional life, which was for a long time the anchor of my twenties, feels pretty stupid and meaningless in the context of pandemic remote work,” said Taylor Broadfoot, 30, who works at a marijuana tech startup in Seattle.For Clair, the pandemic “really reaffirmed that I don't want work to be a core part of my identity,” she said. “I never had huge career aspirations but this has made it even more clear that working 60+ hours a week in a salary position is just not worth it.”“I lost my entire identity,” said Dani Steeves, a 33-year-old event manager in Ontario, Canada. “I didn't realize how intertwined I as a person had become with my job. I lost friends who I had worked with for a decade because at a time when I needed them the most, they were radio silent.” After that, “I am no longer a person who views their future solely in career terms. Now that I have seen I am an expendable asset to a company that I had devoted my life to, my future outlook no longer always involves the career I thought I would never leave.” Advertisement  Without the potential of a career, romance, or parenthood to give us a sense of identity and purpose, what’s left?“In some ways, the pandemic actually helped me become more sure of myself and make more definitive plans for the future,” said Sydney Spaulding, 23, a writer in San Diego. “When going out all the time wasn't an option anymore, it made me really look at myself in the mirror and try to get to know that person better. In a way, that was a positive change that came out of all this.”
 


Barry F. Keaveney, a 75-year-old semi-retired photographer in rural Arizona, is focusing on “finding satisfaction in home alone time: watching better movies, better cooking, updating computer knowledge.” He thinks we’re facing “a dark future with the Covid pandemic, polarized politics, QAnon and Trump haters and liars, real climate threats and a failed Congress to deal with these problems.” He’s coping with the ambiguous losses of the past couple years by “making up for lost time.” That means “going around with my new cameras, taking photos, considering getting back to drone videos but with more new and professional gear.”“I used to want to have everything figured out, but now I am more happy in the moment,” said Maria Natola, a 32-year-old high school teacher in Vancouver. “I know what I need to be content and to feel like I am living a full life, and many of the things I thought I ‘needed’ have turned out to be nice extras that don't make or break my life. It's cliche, but I've learned that it truly is the little things, and if the little things don't make you happy, neither will the ‘big’ things.”“I think I lost my tolerance for bullshit during the pandemic,” said Jeane Emily DuBose, a 26-year-old who works in medical research in Chicago. “I kind of decided that I'm not going to be afraid of things anymore. I decided to start writing the book I'd been thinking about for years but never actually put to paper. I quit grad school. I quit my job and found a better one I'm excited about. I started making dumb TikToks about vintage romance novels because it's something I enjoy. I've spent so much time being afraid and I decided that I don't care anymore.”“I need to make full use of my pause to really do what I want to do next year,” said Gulati, the 22-year-old Canadian who’s been reflecting a lot on her mortality. “I have to sit down with myself and figure out what that even is. I can’t be afraid of the future, as tiresome as it is to live it. The future is happening right now, and I want to make the most of it. I don’t want to let the past two years dictate the rest of my life. I tried to ‘live’ this summer — I slept with more men than deserved it and got too many piercings. I want to rediscover what meaning actually means to me and I want to live it. For real, this time.” ●

258,Here are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests ,"


If you’ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately, you may have found long lines, empty shelves, and a frustrating lack of availability in general.This is happening as Omicron is making up the majority of new cases in the country, now about 95% of cases in the US.President Joe Biden recently announced that the US government is buying 500 million at-home COVID tests for the nation.While increased test availability is a good thing, those government-supplied, at-home COVID tests may not be available to request until January and could take months to be distributed. And if you are able to get your hands on rapid COVID tests, a lot of questions remain. How reliable are they? When should you use them? Do they perform differently with Omicron? Advertisement     Here are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests.When should you use rapid COVID tests?Rapid COVID tests are, well, rapidly becoming a way of life in the US. After being absent in the US for much of the pandemic, they are more widely available — and often sold out — in pharmacies and grocery stores as well as online.The pro is that they give fast results — in about 15 minutes, allowing you to make quick changes in behavior if you get a positive result.The con is that they may not be as accurate very early in an infection compared with other tests, like a PCR, that can take a day or more to get results.“Rapid tests are one of the most powerful tools that have not really been utilized in a powerful way in this pandemic,” said longtime testing advocate Dr. Michael Mina, a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer of eMed, a digital platform that facilitates at-home testing. “The government is in a position now where it’s bringing these tests forward, and now is the time to start creating a strategy around how will they be most effectively used,” he said Tuesday at a press briefing.You can take a COVID test for any reason at all, but here are the times the FDA recommends you get tested, even if you have been vaccinated.If you have COVID symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, fever, and other respiratory virus symptomsHave been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed case of COVID for a total of at least 15 minutes. (If you are unvaccinated, get tested right away; if you are fully vaccinated, get tested within five to seven days after exposure, according to the CDC.)If you took part in high-risk activities, including any time you couldn’t socially distance as recommended, such as when traveling, in crowded indoor places, or attending large gatherings or mass eventsMany people who are asymptomatic are now getting screening tests for COVID at work, school, or before or after travel or events.Although vaccines, especially when combined with a booster, are likely to protect against hospitalizations and death due to the Omicron variant, “we know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who were vaccinated,” CDC chief Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing on Wednesday. “These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others.”Regardless of vaccination status, you should wear a mask in public indoor settings. Walensky encouraged people to take at-home COVID-19 tests before gathering indoors “to help protect you and your family and friends who may be at greater risk of COVID-19 or severe outcomes.”How many different at-home COVID tests are there?There are now (at least) 11 over-the-counter antigen tests, which are the rapid tests that you can buy, take yourself, and generally cost about $20 to $35 for two — if you can find them.An antigen test detects proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can be picked up with a nasal swab.Keep in mind that no test is perfect. Any given medical test is measured by its sensitivity, or how good it is at picking up actual cases and not generating false negatives, and specificity, how good it is at ruling out people who aren’t sick and not generating false positives.Here are some of the at-home antigen tests that have been approved via the FDA’s emergency-use authorization:BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self TestiHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid TestFlowflex COVID-19 Antigen Home TestBD Veritor At-Home COVID-19 TestCareStart COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test/On/Go COVID-19 Antigen SelfTestSCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-TestInteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid TestCelltrion DiaTrust COVID-19 Ag Home TestQuidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 TestEllume COVID-19 Home TestThere are also over-the-counter molecular tests that are similar to PCR and can detect the virus earlier than an antigen test, but they cost more, Mina said. They include Detect, Cue Health, and Lucira, which can be done at home, as well as other molecular tests that are done in doctor’s offices.“Rapid molecular tests are slightly more sensitive but they are a lot more expensive,” Mina said. There are also fewer of them available. “It’s a much more difficult technology to build than a rapid antigen test,” he said.Are rapid COVID tests accurate and reliable?In general, yes. But you should know that false negatives are more likely to occur early on with rapid tests than with laboratory tests, like PCR.And it’s important to note, a small new study suggests that you can spread the virus in those early days if you are getting a false negative on a rapid antigen test.The study, which is not yet peer reviewed, included test results from 30 people out of hundreds involved in workplace outbreaks in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in December 2021. The people were fully vaccinated, many with boosters.The research team, led by epidemiologist Blythe Adamson, compared nasal swab rapid antigen tests to saliva-based and nasal-swab-based PCR test results. They found that at least four people had transmitted the virus during the time they had a false negative on a rapid test.While it’s “alarming” that the rapid tests didn’t always detect a high viral load, the study is getting a lot of attention and manufacturers will be working to update their tests, Adamson told BuzzFeed News.“FDA is paying close attention and I think manufacturers are ready to try to adapt and be agile,” she said. “So I think it will move quickly.”False positives are much less common. However, the chances of a false positive can vary by brand, ranging from one in 150 tests to one in 5,000, said Mina.That said, if your rapid test gives a positive result, you should assume you probably have COVID and isolate until you follow up with another type of test, like PCR.Rapid tests are about 30% to 40% less sensitive than PCR tests, and they are more accurate in people with symptoms than without symptoms.In one study, a popular at-home rapid test had a sensitivity of about 35% in asymptomatic people and 64% in people with symptoms when compared with PCR, but was around 100% accurate when it came to people who tested positive for COVID, whether or not they had symptoms. In the study, there were only a handful of false positives, all in asymptomatic people — but 47% were false negatives compared with PCR.These are still good tests! It’s not fair to compare rapid tests you can do at home in 15 minutes to a lab-based result that might be more accurate but takes a day or more (often many more) to get a result, Mina said. You may just need to keep all that in mind when taking a rapid test and know that taking multiple rapid tests is part of the strategy.“The test is very good when it’s positive, but when negative may frequently give you a false negative result,” said Dr. Stanley Weiss, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey.If you get a negative result, follow up with additional rapid tests in a few days to see if it becomes positive, especially if you have reason to believe that you were exposed or infected. Wait at least 24 hours for your next test, according to the CDC, but retesting a few days later can help you feel comfortable that a negative result is a true negative.Mina recommends that if you start having symptoms, assume you have Omicron and self-isolate. Take your first rapid test 24 hours after symptoms start and test again two to three days later.When interpreting and making decisions based on a test result, it’s a good idea to take into account a person’s history of vaccination, mask use, exposures to others, and their general likelihood of actually being COVID positive, Weiss said.Can rapid tests detect the Omicron variant?Yes, that seems to be the case, although the FDA recently announced that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive to Omicron than the Delta variant.It makes sense that a variant might change the reliability of the tests used to detect the virus and the FDA is asking manufacturers to test their products to make sure they work against Omicron and future variants.The FDA has identified a few PCR-based tests that don’t and have recommended that labs don’t use them.If you do have COVID symptoms, can it now take longer for tests to show a positive result than at the beginning of the pandemic?Yes, according to Mina. That’s because early in the pandemic, humans had not been exposed to the virus previously and symptoms — which are a sign the immune system recognizes and is fighting the virus — started later in the timeline of infection.Now that millions of people have either had COVID, been vaccinated, or in some cases both, symptoms generally start sooner. (And it’s clear that you can get COVID two or more times.)“You're going to become symptomatic potentially within a day after exposure because your immune system kicks in so early,” Mina said. He also noted that’s why COVID symptoms have changed and now include congestion and runny nose. “That’s your immunity working,” he said.Is a lateral flow test the same thing as an antigen test?Not exactly. A lateral flow test is a specific type where you dip a piece of paper in a liquid and after a few minutes one line appears — a positive control to show the test is working — and another line appears if the test is positive.While all rapid antigen tests currently on the market for COVID are lateral flow tests, not all lateral flow tests are COVID tests. For example, pregnancy tests also work in this way but use urine rather than a nasal swab for testing.Can a rapid test protect you from getting sick?Not really. Rapid tests are more about protecting other people, not making sure you don’t get the virus. (That’s what vaccines, masks, and social distancing are all about.)However, when people get tested before going to work, a party, school, or traveling, it helps protect everyone. (Although it also helps you get treatment sooner, which is important because almost all effective treatments for COVID are more likely to work the sooner they are started.)Rapid testing is particularly good to help stop superspreaders of the virus, Mina said.“For somebody who’s really spewing out tons of virus and is very likely to infect a lot of people, then the tests are more likely 95% or 98% sensitive for those individuals,” he said.

259,2021 has led the BuzzFeed Copy Desk in new directions and presented us with new predicaments about how to use language in the news.,"


This is an excerpt from Quibbles & Bits, the BuzzFeed News copy desk’s newsletter. Sign up below to nerd out about language and style with us once a month!
 


It’s been a long year! 2021 has led the BuzzFeed copy desk in new directions and presented us with new predicaments about how to use language in the news. From the very first week of 2021, the events of Jan. 6 forced us to navigate big questions: Is this an insurrection or an attempted coup or a domestic terrorist attack? Did that person steal a podium or a lectern? Are the words “protesters” and “demonstrators” too legitimizing? Can we call it a riot?We will likely be looking back at Jan. 6 and its fallout for the rest of our lives, and news stories will serve as artifacts of how journalists characterized it in real time. The copy desk is always weighing the ramifications of our words and determining what is the most truthful and fair. And as with any semantic discussion in the news world, we need to question whether language we’ve ascribed to an event is obsolete, whether it’s evolved, and whether it accurately fits the situation.In each issue of our Quibbles & Bits newsletter this year, we’ve shared how our copy desk has processed language and given a behind-the-scenes look at BuzzFeed News’ decision-making — and sometimes how other news outlets are working through these topics as well. Advertisement     Here are the discussions we had this year:In March, we debunked eight grammar and language myths you’ve likely been victimized by. These have been taught by generations of schoolteachers, reinforced by old-fashioned style books, and gleefully (but wrongly) championed in Twitter hypercorrections. We implore you to forget them.Two weeks later, we unpacked how something as tiny as a hyphen can have a big impact on language. Inspired by Twitter user @challahbackjew and research from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance and the Anti-Defamation League, we shared our style change on the word antisemitism. The hyphenated form (anti-semitism), we wrote, accentuates the Semitism part and implies the existence of a Semitic race of people, an erroneous notion rooted in Nazi ideology.This summer, we spoke with autistic people about identity-first language versus person-first language. The latter, a mainstay of many newsrooms’ style guides and sensitivity guidelines, has traditionally been used to describe people with disabilities, people experiencing homelessness, or people in jail. But this trend may be receding, as many communities (including autistic, Deaf, blind, and disabled people) now generally opt for identity-first language. “We recognize that disability and personhood are not mutually exclusive; they are not oxymoronic,” Lydia X. Z. Brown told us.In September, we emphasized the need to uncover the origins of modern slang, which is often rooted in African American Vernacular English (AAVE). When we divorce language from its context, we risk further oppressing not only Black people but also the communities they intersect with, including other people of color, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. Black culture is not deserving of mockery or appropriation — it demands respect.Then, in November, we noted that ableist phrasing is ubiquitous in modern language, from clichés to callous analogies that devalue disabled people. Some examples are obvious, like “crippling” or “handicap,” but others are more nuanced and require a perceptive copy editor to think about whether the words are dubious in context.On a different front, we developed some style quizzes (we are the BuzzFeed copy desk; we must contain multitudes).

260,"The summer of 2021, punctuated by extreme heat and flooding, showed that climate change is already deadly.","


No one is safe. That’s the disturbing lesson of 2021, a year when every corner of the US was pounded by deadly weather disasters.A wicked winter storm descended on the middle of the country in February, bringing subfreezing temperatures to the typically temperate Texas, knocking out power and freezing people to death in their homes. In late June, people and animals were literally cooked to death in the Pacific Northwest, where temperatures shot up so high they rivaled those of California’s Death Valley. An August rainstorm unleashed so much water in a single day that a small Tennessee town turned into a raging river, knocking homes, with people still in them, right off their foundations. A late-summer catastrophic hurricane, wielding strong winds and heavy rains, battered communities from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast. And, most recently, a string of rare December tornadoes whipped through communities nationwide, pulverizing anything in their way.
 


“It was a really bad year,” said Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. He added, “We said that last year, and the year before, and the year before that. We’ve had a whole lot of bad years in a row for extreme weather.”This year’s devastation wasn’t just the result of random extreme weather. It was the kind of extreme weather that’s playing out in a world that has already warmed 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) in the past century and a half, an irreversible result of people pumping carbon dioxide, methane, and other dangerous greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.“This climate change stuff is already here,” Wehner continued. “The impacts are here. The sooner we accept that fact, the sooner we can start adapting our society to deal with it.” Advertisement  It’s natural to wonder: Is it only climate change that is making every terrible disaster, well, so terrible and so deadly? The answer is not so straightforward. And, adding to the confusion, the US doesn’t accurately track climate and weather deaths.For example, it’s still not well understood whether climate change is making tornadoes more likely to form and more intense. There’s more research to suggest that climate change is mucking with polar vortex patterns and worsening winter storms, like the one that slammed into Texas this year. Even that is still an open area of scientific debate.But the summer of 2021 is a different story.Climate change undoubtedly made the Pacific Northwest heat wave more extreme and deadlier than it would have been in a cooler world. The science is also robust linking rising temperatures to increasingly rainier events across the US — such as the Tennessee floods and Hurricane Ida — a result of a warmer atmosphere being able to hold more water vapor.These record-setting disasters were not acting alone. They are coupled with government officials, at every level, being woefully unprepared. A lack of air-conditioning in the Pacific Northwest left people unable to cope with the unbearable heat. A combination of outdated flooding maps, overwhelmed sewers and drainage systems, and unprotected homes left people at risk of fast-moving water.This double whammy has killed people.Among the dead were children, parents, and grandparents. They were sick and they were healthy. Their skin colors were white, Black, and brown. They were homeless and they were in their homes. They were alone and they were with family and friends. They were sheltering in place and they were trying to flee. It’s impossible to pin any of these specific deaths to climate change, but they point toward a terrible trend: The climate crisis is already deadly. Here is a look at some of the stories of people who have died, and what their fates signal about the future. Advertisement  
 


In the days before scorching temperatures arrived in the Pacific Northwest in late June, the National Weather Service kept updating its forecasts with increasingly dire predictions about exactly how hot it could get.On Saturday, June 26, the Portland International Airport recorded 108 degrees, a new all-time high. Temperatures topped 100 degrees across Oregon and Washington that day. Advertisement  Sebastian Francisco Perez, a 38-year-old Guatemalan immigrant who had only arrived in the US earlier in the year, collapsed while working outside at Ernst Nursery & Farms in St. Paul, Oregon. He died that day. At the time, Oregon lacked rules designed to specifically protect outdoor workers from the brutal heat.Sunday was forecast to be hotter, and in many places it was: Seattle hit 104 degrees, Portland’s airport hit 112, and Salem hit 113. In Eugene, temperatures soared to a local record high of 111 degrees, forcing officials to postpone the US Olympic trials for track and field.After enduring two scorching days in their home in northeast Salem without air-conditioning, Vickie Jones recalled thinking Monday, June 28, would be “a little bit cooler.” That’s what the early forecasts had predicted.“It wasn’t. It was hotter yet,” Vickie told BuzzFeed News by phone. “We weren’t ready for that.”That afternoon, Salem reached an all-time record high temperature: a staggering 117 degrees. Earlier in the week, Salem was roughly 30 degrees cooler.Vickie was worrying about her husband of 44 years, Donald, who was napping upstairs in front of a fan. She sent her great-grandchildren to check on him.“You need to come up and see Grandpa right now,” one of the kids yelled. “Something’s wrong.”Vickie found her husband standing in front of the bed, slumped over and unconscious. “His skin was so hot, I could hardly touch him,” she told BuzzFeed News. “I think he got overheated, and it was too late for him to call out because his body started shutting down.” Donald died the next day at the hospital. Advertisement  “He was only 67,” Vickie said. “He wasn’t ill or anything like that. That’s what is hard to grasp.”Based on official reporting of deaths from the extreme heat that persisted for weeks after, this was among the nation’s deadliest heat waves in recent history. Oregon reported at least 96 deaths associated with the event. Washington state officials reported 119 deaths between June 26 and July 2, and an additional 38 heat-related deaths occurring through August.The official numbers don’t tell the full story. The heat wave’s true death toll is likely hundreds higher. According to an excess death analysis conducted by BuzzFeed News, it’s likely that roughly 670 people were killed by the heat in Washington and Oregon in the week ending July 3.Days after the heat wave was officially over, temperatures lingered above 90 degrees in Spokane, Washington. Mickey Hardin texted her ex-husband Charles “Chuck” Hardin, a former salesperson for Budweiser, wishing him a happy 4th of July. His reply was the last time she ever heard from him.
 


“The next-door neighbor saw the newspapers were piling up. The truck was in the driveway,” Mickey said. Charles was found on his kitchen floor, water bottle in hand. He had diabetes, meaning he was especially vulnerable to extreme heat. He didn’t have air-conditioning.“It was a sad, sad situation,” Mickey said. “He will truly be missed.”That same week, an international team of 27 scientists reported the results of a quick study deciphering how much climate change played a role in the record-shattering heat. They found the high temperatures were at least 150 times more likely because of the warming planet; without climate change, they concluded, the heat wave would have been “virtually impossible.”
 


“We haven’t really felt how much we have changed the climate already,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist who contributed to the study. This event showed “what it means when your extremes become so much more extreme.”When asked if climate change was to blame for the hundreds who had died during the heat wave, Otto responded: “We haven’t counted exactly how many of these people are the excess deaths because of climate change — but because climate change is playing such a big role, there are many.”Shawn Cosgrove thinks his brother’s death may be one of them. Randall Cosgrove was a certified electrician and carpenter who did odd jobs across the region, Shawn said. Randy, as his family called him, drove to the site of a new job in Wilsonville, planning to sleep in his truck overnight so he could start first thing in the morning.Instead, he died.“That’s probably the hottest it’s ever been in Oregon,” Shawn told BuzzFeed News. He blamed climate change for what happened.“I think it’s pretty obvious,” he said. “He went to sleep and just baked from the inside out.”
 


On Aug. 21, 2021, before dawn, it started to rain in central Tennessee. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency, its highest flood warning, around 9 a.m. A few hours later, the agency’s Nashville office tweeted: “This is a catastrophic flooding situation.” The small town of McEwen was hit by an astonishing 20.73 inches of rain that day, setting a new state record for 24-hour rainfall.Waverly is a town over — and downhill — from McEwen. At some point during the downpour, debris washed into Trace Creek, which runs between the two towns, and obstructed its flow. Then, suddenly, a trestle bridge along the creek, which had been acting as a sort of levee, catastrophically gave away, officials told BuzzFeed News. Although Waverly only got 8 inches of rainfall that Saturday, in a matter of minutes the town went from being wet to being overrun with a mix of rain and runoff water.Kim Kee was sitting on the couch drinking coffee with her husband, Mark, when he said, “Kim, there’s a noise.”Kim got up and immediately identified the source: Water was pouring into the kitchen. She yelled at her mother to wake up and get dressed. Minutes later, the water was at their waists. Then she got hit from behind by a piece of furniture. She recalled the final moments in her house: “The refrigerator was sparking and falling over, the back door and front door blew in, and I was floating downstream.” Advertisement  She floated several blocks before managing to grab on to a tree limb, holding on for about four hours before being rescued and taken to the hospital. “I was black and blue on every part of me,” she said. “On my right breast, my nipple was just hanging off.”
 


That night, while staying with relatives, Kim learned that her 79-year-old mother, who had also been washed away, was alive after holding on to a telephone pole and U-Haul truck hinge for hours. But her husband was still missing. Mark was a knife maker, a collector of rare Japanese blades, and Kim’s everything. “We had the marriage everyone would kill for,” she said. “We were best friends.”The very next morning, Kim got a call to come back to the hospital. “He’s fine,” she recalled thinking. Then she saw the body bag.Reflecting on what went wrong, Kim blamed local officials and a railroad company for not properly managing the waterways. She does not believe in climate change. “I don’t know what’s going to happen from here,” she said. “Do 20 deaths matter?”While in his car, Jeremiah Shawl saw water topping over the road ahead of him. He used to be a first responder and immediately put that training into action. He went home to pick up a boat and set out to find his mother, Robin Shawl, and mother-in-law, Donna Bradley, both of whom had disabilities and lived in adjacent apartments.“I pulled up to my mother and mother-in-law’s front doors with a boat,” he said, and he was “hollering in there to see if they were still in the apartments.”But neither woman was there, and it's still not entirely clear what happened to them. He spent days searching. Their bodies were eventually found a few miles apart from each other.When Shawl heard the news, he thought about his son and how devastating the deaths would be for him. “My mother was my little boy’s world,” he said. “He practically lived there.”What happened in Waverly, he said, was “not natural.” He blamed much of the destruction on poor management of local waterways. “All the creeks are dried up. They are not cleaned up and not properly taken care of.”But another probable factor is climate change, which scientists say is making this kind of deluge more likely.“Because we know a warmer atmosphere has the capacity for greater water vapor availability, there’s just more water vapor available to these storms, whether they are rainstorms, hurricanes, perhaps even blizzards,” said James Marshall Shepherd, the director of the University of Georgia’s Atmospheric Sciences Program. “And so because of that, we see intense rainfall rates.” Waverly flooded in 2010 and at least once in 2019. This most recent incident was the most damaging and deadliest by far.
 


Just a week later, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4 storm on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. The storm’s fierce winds knocked out power for the entire city of New Orleans, and its strong rains washed out roads and homes. As Ida moved over land, its wind speeds plummeted and it was downgraded to a tropical depression. Still, the heavy rain continued more than 1,000 miles across the US, setting records and killing people up and down the East Coast.“Three-plus inches of rainfall in an hour in New York City — that’s just unheard of,” Shepherd said. In an urban area like New York, all that rain is hitting impervious surfaces, from roads to sidewalks to parking lots, rather than seeping into soils, he explained, “and so you get rapidly rising waters in response.”For the first time ever, the National Weather Service issued flash flood emergency alerts in New York and northeast New Jersey. Advertisement  “The water is coming in right now,” Queens resident Choi Sledge told neighbors in a basement apartment over the phone on Sept. 1, according to an interview with the New York Times. The neighbors were unable to escape, though. Ang Lama, 50, his partner Mingma Sherpa, 48, and their 2-year-old son, Lobsang, all died in their home in Woodside, Queens. A total of 18 people died from the storm in New York, according to the state’s official tally. Many of them died in partially underground apartments that flooded.“It was just too much water,” Robert Echavarria, fire chief in New Jersey’s town of Millburn, told BuzzFeed News.Echavarria’s team rescued more than 100 people. No one died in Millburn, but other towns weren’t so lucky. In total, 33 people died from Ida in New Jersey, making it the state with the storm’s highest fatality count.Shakia Garrett, 33, tried to help her neighbors as the waters started to rise around the Oakwood Plaza apartment complex in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The act of heroism proved fatal. Shakia died, as well as her neighbors: Jose Torres, 74, Rosa Espinal, 72, and their son Jose Torres, 38.The apartments were close to the Elizabeth River, explained Salaam Ismial, a distant relative of Garrett’s and a local advocate helping the impacted families. “It was catastrophic,” Ismial said, adding that the apartment flooded with more than 8 feet of water within minutes. Advertisement     Garrett and the Torres family tried to seek safety by climbing on top of a desk in the Torres apartment, he explained, but the water came too fast and too high. “Shakia was actually the last person to go,” Ismial said. She was on the phone with a Torres family member during the event, he explained. Suddenly the line went eerily silent. Shakia was gone.Due to the widespread flood damage, the entire apartment complex, home to more than 600 people across hundreds of units, shuttered after the storm. Many of those families are still staying in hotels, motels, and shelters, Ismial said. “The government bureaucracy is failing to find permanent housing for these folks.”
 


The climate crisis will only get worse. So is 2022 destined to be just as destructive and deadly as 2021? It doesn’t have to be. Straightforward steps to increase preparation and shore up infrastructure could mitigate much of the damage. But political willpower, urgent action, and key investments are often sorely lacking. Advertisement     That’s starting to shift in the places where the high stakes of climate change have already been made painfully clear.For Oregon’s Multnomah County, which encompasses the city of Portland and was ground zero for more than half of the state’s heat-related deaths, local officials and scientists are determined to avoid so many deaths in future heat waves.Going into last summer, Vivek Shandas, a Portland State University professor who studies how cities can adapt to climate change, had spent more than a decade sounding the alarm about the growing risk of extreme heat in the region. But he never got much traction with local officials or community groups. This year’s heat wave changed everything.“I’ve somehow become the go-to heat researcher for the region,” Shandas told BuzzFeed News, who described being “underwater with requests” from members of the community and government in July and August to talk about heat risk.Jessica Guernsey, the Multnomah County public health administrator, is one of the people now thinking a lot more about heat. “It was really devastating to know that this is going to be a norm,” she told BuzzFeed News, “and that we’re not we’re not fully positioned to [immediately] take care of every person in our community.” Advertisement     Heat-related deaths are preventable, and the solutions are simple: ensuring people are hydrated and cool, ideally with air-conditioning. But since the region has historically never reached such high temperatures, many people didn’t have air-conditioning at home during the last heat wave. That was true for the Joneses, the Hardins, and even Guernsey.If people aren’t able or willing to get air-conditioning at home, local officials can provide freely available “cooling centers.” The challenge is getting people there.Guernsey and her colleagues did a detailed analysis of everyone who died from the heat in the county. The highest number of deaths were people who were living alone on higher floors of buildings with no air-conditioning.“One of the things that really stands out in the event is the isolation,” she said, explaining that so many people died alone. Going into next summer, property managers and owners will need to communicate this risk to their tenants who fit in this category, and local officials will need to reach out to tenants as well. Or, as Guernsey puts it, “doubling and tripling communication.”Likewise, both state and local officials in New Jersey told BuzzFeed News there’s now a greater awareness about climate change and flooding risks after Ida. Advertisement     “I think it did change the conversation a bit,” said Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s environmental protection commissioner. “What hit New Jersey was the remnants of a tropical depression. So basically a really bad thunderstorm destroyed communities and literally washed people away.”
 


This means: “It wasn’t the worst of what we are going to see,” he said. As part of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration, LaTourette said, he’s devising new policies and programs that protect people from repeat and worsening flooding. This includes bolstering stormwater drainage in current and existing developments to incentivizing people to move out of harm’s way.“You know what it takes?” he said. “It takes political courage.”This fall, LaTourette spoke to the residents of Millburn, along with other places, about the state’s Blue Acres program, which offers property buyouts following devastating disasters. But it’s unclear if anyone will apply.“It’s very tough for some of these homeowners,” said Jesse Moehlman, Millburn’s assistant business administrator. “They like the community. They like where they are sending kids to school. It’s weird and difficult to have a conversation around that. They want to live where they live.”Moehlman, like LaTourette, is haunted by the idea of an even worse storm.“In the neighboring Maplewood, there was a resident who died and was sucked into a manhole,” Moehlman said. “All I kept thinking was, as a community, this could have been much worse. More people could have lost their lives.”In contrast, it’s hard to see how the flooding in Waverly, Tennessee, could have been any worse.According to Chris Davis, sheriff of Humphreys County, who was born and raised in Waverly and helped respond to the disaster, some 600 homes were demolished, dozens and dozens of families have already moved away, and he expects it could take a decade for the region to fully recover.“This was a massive, tragic event, nothing like we’ve ever seen,” Davis said.After resisting for decades, Humphreys County finally signed up for the federal flood insurance program in September. This immediately made the county eligible for certain types of funding to help respond to the current disaster and prepare for a future one. This won’t change much in Waverly, though, which was already a part of the federal program. What could have a local impact, though, explained Waverly Mayor W.B. Frazier, is a new floodplain management study commissioned by the US Army Corps of Engineers. “As a result of that study, there’ll be some correction actions, plans, and projects to come out of that,” Frazier told BuzzFeed News.Davis blamed much of the damage from the disaster on a dangerous pileup of debris that blocked a bridge until the water catastrophically poured out elsewhere. “I honestly do not feel like climate change had anything to do with it,” he said, later adding: “This was an act of Mother Nature.”Frazier, a longtime Waverly resident, had a different diagnosis for what happened. “I am a firm believer that our climate is changing on us, and it looks to me, by these flooding events especially, that it's getting more severe.”And since the August floods, he added, “I think there are more believers.” ●

261,"Opinion: If the priority with each new variant is to race toward reopening society by offering boosters instead of tackling the root cause, we could face an endless cycle of resurgences.","


Governments around the world are struggling to suppress a tidal wave of the Omicron variant, which appears to be spreading faster and evading vaccines more efficiently than any previous COVID-19 variant. Most developed nations have responded to this threat by encouraging their populations to get booster shots and doubling down on vaccination efforts on their home turf.As the head of a global organization dedicated to vaccinating the world, I can see that focusing on this alone is a dangerous mistake.If the priority with each new variant of concern is to race toward reopening society by offering boosters instead of tackling the root cause — namely, the fact that nearly 3.5 billion people still have not been vaccinated — then we could face an endless cycle of resurgences and leave the door open for more dangerous variants. Advertisement     This crisis is far from over, and we will never end it until we stop the virus from spreading in all parts of the world.Even though clinical infection with Omicron appears to be more resistant to vaccines, to the best of our knowledge, global vaccination still remains the most effective way to protect people from severe disease and death. Vaccination, even in the Omicron era, likely prevents the overwhelming of health systems and slows transmission, preventing further mutations and new variants from emerging.Yet, more than a year after COVID-19 vaccines first became available, about 43% of the world — predominantly people living in the poorest countries — have not yet had their first shot.Initially, the main reason for this was vaccine hoarding by the world’s wealthiest countries, as well as export restrictions imposed by some countries on both vaccines and the materials needed to make them.This has severely hampered the global effort led by COVAX — a collaboration between Gavi, my organization, UNICEF, WHO, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) — to make COVID-19 vaccines equitably available to people in all corners of the world, particularly the 92 lower-income countries that would have otherwise struggled to get access.The good news is that with 1.5 billion doses now being manufactured a month and 12 billion expected to be produced in total by the end of the year — enough to fully vaccinate everyone on this planet — global supply constraints are now easing and governments are throwing their weight behind COVAX.By the end of the month, COVAX will have allocated 1.6 billion doses and will have shipped over 900 million doses to 144 economies, the vast majority to lower-income countries. And by early 2022, we will have shipped enough doses to reach our original target of protecting on average around 20% of people in most of these countries, including all those most at risk, such as frontline healthcare workers and vulnerable people.However, the danger now with Omicron is that if governments once again turn their attention inward and focus all attention toward making boosters available to their citizens, it could again start to hinder equitable access and further prolong the global crisis. Or if the science determines that new variant-specific vaccines are necessary, it seems likely these new vaccines could be hoarded and not made available to those living in lower-income countries. Advertisement     At first glance, the case for boosters may seem strong, with evidence to suggest that a third dose can provide additional protection and prevent people from becoming infected. But while this could help to slow the spread of this new variant, we still don’t know Omicron’s potential to cause harm.Moreover, there is no evidence to suggest that two doses of existing vaccines are any less effective against Omicron in protecting people from severe disease, hospitalization, or death. This means that getting boosters to low-risk people who already have some protection will only have a limited impact on fighting the disease if we don’t also radically reduce the number of people who are still unvaccinated.Yet, since Omicron emerged, we have already started to see some donor governments slowing the speed at which they are donating vaccines to COVAX, and if high-income countries increase their purchases of products, the worry now is that COVAX’s own supply lines will start to suffer.Boosters are only ever likely to provide a temporary fix so long as the virus is allowed to spread freely elsewhere in the world. It does now seem highly likely that the COVID-19 endgame will mean it eventually becomes endemic. But we will get no closer to that point if, with each resurgence, we don’t start addressing the cause of new variants. That must be the priority for 2022: getting primary doses to everyone.If we end up in a situation where we face Pi, Rho, Sigma, or Tao variants, and fourth, fifth, or sixth booster shots are being offered to some people while billions of others are still waiting on their first, then we really shouldn’t wonder why we are still in a state of global crisis.

262,The White House is defending the CDC's new isolation guidelines for asymptomatic people infected by the coronavirus.,"


The White House on Wednesday dug in against critics of the new CDC guidelines that shortened the recommended isolation period from 10 days to five days for asymptomatic people infected by the coronavirus.Announced on Monday, the guidelines halved the isolation time — the period when people who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 should not be in contact with others — to five days. The five days begin when someone first shows symptoms; people should only emerge from the isolation afterward if those symptoms have stopped. They should then wear “well-fitting” masks for the next five days, according to the new guidelines, rather than continue in isolation. The change comes as COVID-19 cases hit their highest numbers for the entire pandemic, more than 240,000 cases a day on average. Advertisement     The revised policy attracted criticism from many outside public health experts, who said a negative antigen test should be required before someone ends their isolation, or that the shorter isolation should apply only to vaccinated people. The changes came just days after the CDC relaxed recommendations for infected healthcare workers to seven days of isolation, with a negative test.“Let me make clear that we are standing on the shoulders of two years of science, two years of understanding transmissibility,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said on Wednesday, defending the five-day guideline.Around 85% to 90% of viral transmissions, the “vast majority,” she said, happen in the first one to two days before people feel symptoms, and within the two to three days of those symptoms starting. COVID-19 symptoms include a cough, sore throat, headache, fever, chills, lost sense of taste, diarrhea, and other cold and flulike complaints.Walensky said that PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 genes could give positive results for weeks after a person ceases being infectious, making them useless in isolation decisions. The CDC did not recommend a negative antigen test before ending isolation, she added, because the results, positive or negative, do not definitively show whether someone is still infectious. “On the other hand, we know that after five days people are much less likely to transmit the virus and that masking further reduces that risk,” Walensky said, pointing to the five days of masking required after the isolation period as significant added protection. Advertisement     Nevertheless, critics such as University of Saskatchewan virologist Angela Rasmussen argue that a positive antigen test does point to some significant amount of virus still present in a patient, meaning they could be infectious. People should have that information before ending isolation, she suggested on Twitter, in response to Walensky.
 


The CDC’s relaxed policy has sparked derision on Twitter, where satirical takes on the agency’s permissiveness have (perhaps excessively) taken off:
 


But some independent experts have defended the agency’s reasoning.
 


Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday via email that he welcomed the news.“It’s been clear for some time that a one-size-fits-all period for isolation did not fit the period of contagiousness,” Adalja said. “The updated guidance reflects the fact that this is going to be an endemic virus and the disruption of a case can be safely minimized based on the enhanced scientific understanding that has accumulated.”Yet Adalja cautioned that antigen testing would improve the protocol. “Rapid antigen tests, if they were widely available, should also be used to precision-guide these durations.”At the Wednesday White House briefing, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony Fauci cited continuing signs that the Omicron variant, now responsible for the majority of US cases, tends to cause severe illness less often.However, it’s unclear whether this means Omicron is an intrinsically less dangerous bug than previous variants. It could also be that Omicron seems milder because it is infecting more vaccinated people, who are mostly protected from severe disease.“Increased transmissibility of Omicron resulting in an extremely high volume of cases may override some of the impact of the lower disease severity,” Fauci said. “So we should not become complacent.”David Mack contributed reporting to this story.

263,Death tolls from extreme weather events are largely undercounted. It's hurting our ability to prevent future casualties.,"


The number of people who die from extreme weather in the US is being alarmingly undercounted. Without accurate knowledge of the true loss of human life, it will be hard to know how to save more people when the next disaster strikes. Families of the uncounted victims will struggle to get benefits, political leaders will not feel the pressure to better prepare, and people will not realize how lethal climate change really is in the US, right now.As global warming brings more intense weather extremes, the need for more reliable data is literally a matter of life and death. Here’s how and why the data is so inaccurate.Take the unprecedented heat wave that hit the Pacific Northwest in late June and early July. According to data downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Events Database, supposed to be a key US resource on the impacts of extreme weather, only seven people died in Washington state from excessive heat. Advertisement  During this time, emergency services were overwhelmed by calls for help, and coroners later recorded that dozens of people had died from heat-related illnesses; it's absurd to suggest that the death toll was in single figures. Having combed through death certificates, state authorities eventually put the number of people who perished in Washington at 119 between June 26 and July 2. Yet the toll for the state in NOAA’s database remained unchanged (the database was down at the time of publication).Even more troubling is that the state’s toll of 119 is also a massive undercount. This is according to a BuzzFeed News analysis that examines how many more people die after a given event, comparing it to the number predicted from long-term and seasonal trends. This approach, known as an “excess deaths” analysis, is the most comprehensive method for estimating hard-to-tally death counts — it has been used, for instance, to calculate the full global toll from the COVID-19 pandemic.For the Pacific Northwest heat wave, our excess deaths analysis represents the most complete accounting yet. In Washington state, it reveals that the heat wave likely killed more than 440 people there in the week ending July 3. And it suggests that another 230 or so people were killed that same week in Oregon — again more than that state’s list of 96 recorded heat wave deaths. Advertisement  The Pacific Northwest heat wave is just one example of how official sources are failing to account for the full toll from extreme weather. “I think it’s critically important that we know how destructive these events are, both in terms of capital losses and human losses — and we don’t,” John Mutter, an environmental and social scientist at Columbia University who studies the impacts of natural disasters, told BuzzFeed News. “We could be off by a long way.” Experts agree that there is currently no accurate national database accounting for the lives lost to extreme weather.With climate change already increasing the frequency or severity of deadly weather extremes, this official ignorance is a big and growing problem. “It’s extremely important, because you can’t manage something that you don’t measure,” Susan Cutter, who heads the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News.Solving this problem will require an overhaul of how deaths are recorded and sophisticated analytical methods to model the relationships between extreme weather and deaths. Right now, however, that isn’t a top priority for most state and federal agencies. By failing to account for the full toll so they can learn how to reduce it, government officials are missing chances to save hundreds or thousands of people from avoidable deaths, overheated or frozen in their homes or on the streets, or caught up in the chaos of a devastating storm.

In the US, the two main official sources of information on deaths related to extreme weather are NOAA’s Storm Event Database and the CDC, which is the main federal agency responsible for mortality statistics. On a global scale, severe weather deaths are tracked in an international database, EM-DAT, which covers a wide range of disasters from earthquakes to transport accidents, and is the World Meteorological Organization’s go-to source for information on deaths from weather and climate extremes.
 


This chart, derived from NOAA’s Storm Events Database, EM-DAT, and underlying causes of death recorded by the CDC from death certificates, shows how each source gives a different picture of the annual death toll in the US from extreme weather.“We have a problem here,” Debarati Guha-Sapir of the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, formerly director of its Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, which runs EM-DAT, told BuzzFeed News. “If the data is misleading, it can bring us a whole lot of grief, because conclusions can be wrong.”Much of the discrepancy in the leading databases arises from differences in their methods for tracking weather-related deaths. NOAA’s Storm Events Database starts from recorded weather events and then assesses the death toll mostly from numbers provided by local officials or reported in the media. EM-DAT takes a similar event-based approach — in its case looking at events in which 10 or more people died, 100 or more people were affected, or where a state of emergency was officially declared.The other leading approach, used by the CDC, is to compile counts from the causes listed on death certificates — possible because the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has a series of codes that relate to extreme weather, including “Exposure to excessive natural heat” and “Victim of flooding.” Advertisement  
 


The CDC’s numbers for extreme weather deaths are much higher. This is mainly due to its more complete accounting for deaths attributed to excessive natural cold or heat, which averaged 733 and 410 per year respectively from 2000 to 2020. Many people die from overheating or cold outside of extreme heat waves or cold snaps, so are missed by event-based methods.But as the system works right now, death certificates are also missing many fatalities from weather extremes. The CDC gets its data from the states, which in turn compile information from local coroners and medical examiners. And how they fill in death certificates is far from standardized.What gets recorded on a death certificate also typically misses the indirect ways in which storms and other severe weather events can kill, including deaths from traffic accidents as people evacuate, electrocution from downed power lines, or heart attacks from overexertion.The NOAA event-based database does try to account for those indirect deaths, as does EM-DAT. But the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather ripple out in ways that are hard to measure. “Displaced elderly people are very vulnerable,” said Mutter. “They lose track of what their medications are.”NOAA’s failure so far to recognize the full extent of what happened in Washington state during the summer heat wave shows how inadequate event-based recording can be. A NOAA spokesperson noted that the CDC “maintains the official government records on cause of death” and said that NOAA’s numbers for an event that happened almost six months ago were still “preliminary.”“The verification process for the heat wave in late June/early July is ongoing,” the NOAA spokesperson said by email.
 


Deaths can also accumulate over much longer periods than are typically considered by officials accounting for the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather. The most extreme example happened in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017. As cremations took place in the wake of the storm without being included in the official death count, nobody familiar with the situation on the ground believed the US territory’s official tally of just 64 deaths.The full toll was revealed only by comparing the number of deaths that occurred in previous years with the much higher numbers over the weeks that followed the storm, as Puerto Rico was hit by widespread power outages and disruptions to its healthcare system. In December 2017, the New York Times estimated that around 1,000 people more than expected had died in the six weeks after Maria made landfall. Finally, Puerto Rico’s governor commissioned a study from George Washington University, which estimated the storm-related death toll out to February 2018, coming up with a figure of 2,975.In reality, none of the official sources are hitting the right numbers. “I tell students and others to never trust a death toll, no matter who is estimating it,” Mutter said.As emergency managers and public health experts try to convince political leaders of the urgency of action to counter climate change and to reduce the impact of the severe weather it is brewing, the data gaps are becoming more pressing. “If you don’t capture the damage, there is no pressure you bring to bear,” Guha-Sapir said.
 


This year has shone a particularly harsh light on the deficiencies in official accounting for the toll from extreme weather. According to state and local counts, the winter storm that hit Texas in February and the Pacific Northwest heat wave were the two deadliest extreme weather events in the US this year — followed by the tornadoes that devastated parts of the South and Midwest over the night of Dec. 10–11 and Hurricane Ida and its remnants.But it took excess deaths analyses to reveal how bad the Texas freeze and Northwest heat wave really were. In May, BuzzFeed News estimated the true toll in Texas in February, which was hundreds more than the official count. Similar to methods used to investigate the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, we trained statistical models on mortality data that the CDC collects from individual states, which were then used to estimate the number of expected deaths in any week in any state. These models were reviewed by three independent experts in excess deaths analysis.We then compared the models’ predictions to the number of deaths that were actually recorded, after subtracting deaths attributed to COVID-19. (The models were trained on data from 2015 to 2019, before the pandemic hit.) Advertisement  In May, when the Texas Department of State Health Services was recording 151 winter storm deaths, we estimated that just over 700 more people than expected had died in Texas during the week of the storm and worst power outages. The state’s tally has since increased to 210. As more death certificate data has been transferred from Texas to the CDC, our analysis now estimates the excess death toll in the week ending Feb. 20 at more than 750.Our estimates for the Pacific Northwest heat wave, which suggest that around 670 people likely died as a result of the excessive heat across Washington and Oregon in the week ending July 3, were calculated in exactly the same way.The BuzzFeed News analysis of these events also underlined the shortcomings of relying on the underlying cause of deaths recorded on death certificates, as the spikes we identified were driven in large part by deaths attributed to causes other than exposure to cold or heat. Instead, many deaths triggered by the Texas freeze and by the heat wave in Washington were recorded as deaths from underlying medical conditions — in particular, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.That makes sense, as people who are already medically vulnerable are more likely to die if exposed to excessive cold or heat. But it means that the CDC’s counts of deaths from extreme weather based on ICD codes are missing an important part of the picture. “Underlying cause is certainly not always going to have the complete information,” Robert Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC, told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement  In some states and counties, recording deaths is the responsibility of coroners who may have no specialist medical training. What’s needed, experts told BuzzFeed News, is greater standardization in death reporting, including noting additional factors that contributed to someone’s death as well as an underlying cause.
 


Clearly, more sophisticated approaches are needed to track the true toll of extreme weather and climate change on human lives. “We have to modernize. We have to find new methods,” said Guha-Sapir. That includes excess deaths analysis, she added.Other insights can come from epidemiological studies that examine in detail the relationship between the number of recorded deaths in a given place and time, and extreme weather there.Where that has been done, estimates for deaths associated with extreme heat exceed the numbers recorded by the CDC from death certificates. In April 2020, researchers led by Kate Weinberger, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia, estimated that heat accounted for more than 5,600 deaths per year from 1997 to 2006 across some 300 counties. The area studied covered more than 60% of the US population. Advertisement  A national study of trends in heat deaths published in December 2020 from researchers led by Scott Sheridan, a climatologist at Kent State University in Ohio, used similar methods to show that progress in reducing heat deaths was stalling. This came after decades in decline, possibly due to the widespread adoption of air conditioning and better awareness of the risks. Among men ages 45 to 64 across parts of the South and Southwest, heat death rates were actually increasing.For wildfire smoke, one of the biggest single causes of weather- and climate-related deaths, epidemiological studies provide the only way of counting the dead.Studies that have modeled the long-term effects of breathing air laden with tiny particles from wildfire smoke indicate that thousands of Americans die every year as a result. Given the trend for larger and more intense wildfires driven by climate change, the number is forecast to double by the end of the century, according to a 2018 study from researchers led by Bonne Ford, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. This increasing toll from wildfire smoke is expected to partly offset public health gains from reducing other forms of air pollution.But you won’t find deaths from wildfire smoke listed in any official database. “When people talked about the costs of wildfires, it was all about the cost of fighting fires, damage to property, and direct deaths from the fire,” Ford told BuzzFeed News. “That’s the motivation for why we started doing these studies.” Advertisement  
 


Knowing how many people are dying from extreme weather is only the start. To reduce the toll, you also need to know which groups of the population are most vulnerable, and have a plan to protect them at times when the risks are most severe. In general, the burden falls most heavily on the less wealthy and on racial minorities: A study published in October from the CDC, based on ICD codes from death certificates, found that the death rate from natural disasters for Black people was 1.87 times times higher than for white people, while for Native Americans the rate was 7.34 times higher.The details vary from place to place, however. In Multnomah County, Oregon, which includes the city of Portland, the people hardest hit during this year’s heat wave were older, living alone, on higher floors of buildings, and with no air conditioning, according to the county’s public health director, Jessica Guernsey. Advertisement     But in Maricopa County in Arizona, home to some 4.5 million people who live in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and where almost every day in the summer brings life-threatening heat, the risk profile is very different. There, the typical victim is a man without regular shelter in his 40s or 50s with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. Often people die from exposure to heat after overdosing, said David Hondula, who in September was appointed to head the city of Phoenix’s new Heat Response & Mitigation Office. “It’s that story over and over and over again,” Hondula told BuzzFeed News.The Maricopa County Department of Public Health is one of the most thorough in the nation at recording deaths from extreme heat. Yet the toll there has been steadily rising. In 2020, Maricopa County recorded 323 heat-associated deaths, an increase of more than 60% from 2019, and 15 times the number recorded in 2001. If reducing heat mortality is the “barometer for success,” Hondula said, “we are failing.”Given the link between these deaths and substance abuse, Hondula’s office is now considering measures that — without the data at its disposal — might seem unconnected to the dangers of excessive heat. One idea is to equip volunteers with the Phoenix Community Emergency Response Team with Narcan, the emergency treatment for opioid overdoses. Advertisement     
 


If cities and states across the nation are to reduce the death toll from extreme weather, they will need to overhaul their methods for counting the dead, develop better systems to recognize when emergency plans need to be activated, and have a comprehensive approach to reducing the risks for the most vulnerable people.“There’s a whole suite of hazard mitigation that can come into play,” said Cutter. “We need better preparedness. We need better warning systems. We need to do some interventions such as adding more greenery to cities.” The last measure can help reduce the urban heat islands that can turn poorer neighborhoods into death traps in the summer as asphalt and concrete absorb the sun’s heat. Advertisement     As the Pacific Northwest heat wave showed, responding to the reality of climate change may mean dealing with events that exceed anything that has come before. Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who studies health risks from climate change, has advocated for “stress testing,” in which local health agencies, emergency responders, and other stakeholders conduct war game–like exercises to consider how to respond to hypothetical extreme weather outside of their previous experience.But there are formidable structural and political obstacles to overcome. “I’ve never believed numbers from a state agency. They always have reasons to exaggerate or diminish,” Mutter of Columbia University said. When it comes to getting aid from the federal government, states have a vested interest in stressing how hard they were hit by a disaster. But when the death toll is largely due to failures in a state’s own infrastructure or planning, the incentive works the other way.Deaths from extreme cold in Texas in February are a case in point. Several states were hit by the winter storm that swept through the region around Valentine’s Day weekend. But only Texas experienced a large spike in deaths, after its power grid failed. This came a decade after the state had been warned by federal officials that its power infrastructure was vulnerable to cold, after narrowly escaping a similar disaster in 2011. Advertisement     The CDC, meanwhile, has been working with the National Association of Medical Examiners to try and improve the recording of deaths following natural disasters, and has online training materials that encourage coroners, medical examiners, and physicians to take a broader view of what gets recorded as a disaster-related death. But with responsibility for recording deaths lying with local and state authorities, the CDC is limited to an advisory role — it has no direct power to change how deaths are recorded at the local level.
 


And while several federal agencies have offices focusing on climate and health, there has so far been no concerted effort across the US government to better account for the lives lost to extreme weather. “It’s nobody’s responsibility,” Ebi said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is charged with making sure the US is prepared to withstand and respond to major disasters, but has “not really been part of the picture,” Ebi added.“We know that extreme weather is a matter of life or death,” Jaclyn Rothenberg, FEMA’s director of public affairs, told BuzzFeed News by email. “As emergency management continues to evolve to meet the demands of our changing climate, it will continue to necessitate us to become more advanced in the ways we understand and react to extreme weather.”After a year of successive weather disasters, which have exposed both the fragility of US infrastructure and the nation’s inability to count the lives lost, experts say there should be an urgent focus on improving data gathering and acting on that information.Right now, they warn, local, state, and federal agencies are in the dark, flying into a major storm, as climate change threatens an even more hazardous future.“Disasters are windows of opportunity to make change,” Ebi said. But the tragedy is that officials often only start planning for weather extremes after the bodies start piling up. “Until it’s in their face, it tends to not happen.” ●Zahra Hirji contributed reporting for this story.

265,"If you’ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately, you may have found long lines, empty shelves, and a frustrating lack of availability in general. Here's what you need to know.","


If you’ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately, you may have found long lines, empty shelves, and a frustrating lack of availability in general.This is happening as Omicron is making up the majority of new cases in the country, now about 95% of cases in the US.President Joe Biden recently announced that the US government is buying 500 million at-home COVID tests for the nation.While increased test availability is a good thing, those government-supplied, at-home COVID tests may not be available to request until January and could take months to be distributed. And if you are able to get your hands on rapid COVID tests, a lot of questions remain. How reliable are they? When should you use them? Do they perform differently with Omicron? Advertisement     Here are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests.When should you use rapid COVID tests?Rapid COVID tests are, well, rapidly becoming a way of life in the US. After being absent in the US for much of the pandemic, they are more widely available — and often sold out — in pharmacies and grocery stores as well as online.The pro is that they give fast results — in about 15 minutes, allowing you to make quick changes in behavior if you get a positive result.The con is that they may not be as accurate very early in an infection compared with other tests, like a PCR, that can take a day or more to get results.“Rapid tests are one of the most powerful tools that have not really been utilized in a powerful way in this pandemic,” said longtime testing advocate Dr. Michael Mina, a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer of eMed, a digital platform that facilitates at-home testing. “The government is in a position now where it’s bringing these tests forward, and now is the time to start creating a strategy around how will they be most effectively used,” he said Tuesday at a press briefing.You can take a COVID test for any reason at all, but here are the times the FDA recommends you get tested, even if you have been vaccinated.If you have COVID symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, fever, and other respiratory virus symptomsHave been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed case of COVID for a total of at least 15 minutes. (If you are unvaccinated, get tested right away; if you are fully vaccinated, get tested within five to seven days after exposure, according to the CDC.)If you took part in high-risk activities, including any time you couldn’t socially distance as recommended, such as when traveling, in crowded indoor places, or attending large gatherings or mass eventsMany people who are asymptomatic are now getting screening tests for COVID at work, school, or before or after travel or events.Although vaccines, especially when combined with a booster, are likely to protect against hospitalizations and death due to the Omicron variant, “we know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who were vaccinated,” CDC chief Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing on Wednesday. “These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others.”Regardless of vaccination status, you should wear a mask in public indoor settings. Walensky encouraged people to take at-home COVID-19 tests before gathering indoors “to help protect you and your family and friends who may be at greater risk of COVID-19 or severe outcomes.”How many different at-home COVID tests are there?There are now (at least) 11 over-the-counter antigen tests, which are the rapid tests that you can buy, take yourself, and generally cost about $20 to $35 for two — if you can find them.An antigen test detects proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can be picked up with a nasal swab.Keep in mind that no test is perfect. Any given medical test is measured by its sensitivity, or how good it is at picking up actual cases and not generating false negatives, and specificity, how good it is at ruling out people who aren’t sick and not generating false positives.Here are some of the at-home antigen tests that have been approved via the FDA’s emergency-use authorization:BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self TestiHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid TestFlowflex COVID-19 Antigen Home TestBD Veritor At-Home COVID-19 TestCareStart COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test/On/Go COVID-19 Antigen SelfTestSCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-TestInteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid TestCelltrion DiaTrust COVID-19 Ag Home TestQuidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 TestEllume COVID-19 Home TestThere are also over-the-counter molecular tests that are similar to PCR and can detect the virus earlier than an antigen test, but they cost more, Mina said. They include Detect, Cue Health, and Lucira, which can be done at home, as well as other molecular tests that are done in doctor’s offices.“Rapid molecular tests are slightly more sensitive but they are a lot more expensive,” Mina said. There are also fewer of them available. “It’s a much more difficult technology to build than a rapid antigen test,” he said.Are rapid COVID tests accurate and reliable?In general, yes. But you should know that false negatives are more likely to occur early on with rapid tests than with laboratory tests, like PCR.And it’s important to note, a small new study suggests that you can spread the virus in those early days if you are getting a false negative on a rapid antigen test.The study, which is not yet peer reviewed, included test results from 30 people out of hundreds involved in workplace outbreaks in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in December 2021. The people were fully vaccinated, many with boosters.The research team, led by epidemiologist Blythe Adamson, compared nasal swab rapid antigen tests to saliva-based and nasal-swab-based PCR test results. They found that at least four people had transmitted the virus during the time they had a false negative on a rapid test.While it’s “alarming” that the rapid tests didn’t always detect a high viral load, the study is getting a lot of attention and manufacturers will be working to update their tests, Adamson told BuzzFeed News.“FDA is paying close attention and I think manufacturers are ready to try to adapt and be agile,” she said. “So I think it will move quickly.”False positives are much less common. However, the chances of a false positive can vary by brand, ranging from one in 150 tests to one in 5,000, said Mina.That said, if your rapid test gives a positive result, you should assume you probably have COVID and isolate until you follow up with another type of test, like PCR.Rapid tests are about 30% to 40% less sensitive than PCR tests, and they are more accurate in people with symptoms than without symptoms.In one study, a popular at-home rapid test had a sensitivity of about 35% in asymptomatic people and 64% in people with symptoms when compared with PCR, but was around 100% accurate when it came to people who tested positive for COVID, whether or not they had symptoms. In the study, there were only a handful of false positives, all in asymptomatic people — but 47% were false negatives compared with PCR.These are still good tests! It’s not fair to compare rapid tests you can do at home in 15 minutes to a lab-based result that might be more accurate but takes a day or more (often many more) to get a result, Mina said. You may just need to keep all that in mind when taking a rapid test and know that taking multiple rapid tests is part of the strategy.“The test is very good when it’s positive, but when negative may frequently give you a false negative result,” said Dr. Stanley Weiss, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey.If you get a negative result, follow up with additional rapid tests in a few days to see if it becomes positive, especially if you have reason to believe that you were exposed or infected. Wait at least 24 hours for your next test, according to the CDC, but retesting a few days later can help you feel comfortable that a negative result is a true negative.Mina recommends that if you start having symptoms, assume you have Omicron and self-isolate. Take your first rapid test 24 hours after symptoms start and test again two to three days later.When interpreting and making decisions based on a test result, it’s a good idea to take into account a person’s history of vaccination, mask use, exposures to others, and their general likelihood of actually being COVID positive, Weiss said.Can rapid tests detect the Omicron variant?Yes, that seems to be the case, although the FDA recently announced that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive to Omicron than the Delta variant.It makes sense that a variant might change the reliability of the tests used to detect the virus and the FDA is asking manufacturers to test their products to make sure they work against Omicron and future variants.The FDA has identified a few PCR-based tests that don’t and have recommended that labs don’t use them.If you do have COVID symptoms, can it now take longer for tests to show a positive result than at the beginning of the pandemic?Yes, according to Mina. That’s because early in the pandemic, humans had not been exposed to the virus previously and symptoms — which are a sign the immune system recognizes and is fighting the virus — started later in the timeline of infection.Now that millions of people have either had COVID, been vaccinated, or in some cases both, symptoms generally start sooner. (And it’s clear that you can get COVID two or more times.)“You're going to become symptomatic potentially within a day after exposure because your immune system kicks in so early,” Mina said. He also noted that’s why COVID symptoms have changed and now include congestion and runny nose. “That’s your immunity working,” he said.Is a lateral flow test the same thing as an antigen test?Not exactly. A lateral flow test is a specific type where you dip a piece of paper in a liquid and after a few minutes one line appears — a positive control to show the test is working — and another line appears if the test is positive.While all rapid antigen tests currently on the market for COVID are lateral flow tests, not all lateral flow tests are COVID tests. For example, pregnancy tests also work in this way but use urine rather than a nasal swab for testing.Can a rapid test protect you from getting sick?Not really. Rapid tests are more about protecting other people, not making sure you don’t get the virus. (That’s what vaccines, masks, and social distancing are all about.)However, when people get tested before going to work, a party, school, or traveling, it helps protect everyone. (Although it also helps you get treatment sooner, which is important because almost all effective treatments for COVID are more likely to work the sooner they are started.)Rapid testing is particularly good to help stop superspreaders of the virus, Mina said.“For somebody who’s really spewing out tons of virus and is very likely to infect a lot of people, then the tests are more likely 95% or 98% sensitive for those individuals,” he said.

The number of people who die from extreme weather in the US is being alarmingly undercounted. Without accurate knowledge of the true loss of human life, it will be hard to know how to save more people when the next disaster strikes. Families of the uncounted victims will struggle to get benefits, political leaders will not feel the pressure to better prepare, and people will not realize how lethal climate change really is in the US, right now.As global warming brings more intense weather extremes, the need for more reliable data is literally a matter of life and death. Here’s how and why the data is so inaccurate.Take the unprecedented heat wave that hit the Pacific Northwest in late June and early July. According to data downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Events Database, supposed to be a key US resource on the impacts of extreme weather, only seven people died in Washington state from excessive heat. Advertisement  During this time, emergency services were overwhelmed by calls for help, and coroners later recorded that dozens of people had died from heat-related illnesses; it's absurd to suggest that the death toll was in single figures. Having combed through death certificates, state authorities eventually put the number of people who perished in Washington at 119 between June 26 and July 2. Yet the toll for the state in NOAA’s database remained unchanged (the database was down at the time of publication).Even more troubling is that the state’s toll of 119 is also a massive undercount. This is according to a BuzzFeed News analysis that examines how many more people die after a given event, comparing it to the number predicted from long-term and seasonal trends. This approach, known as an “excess deaths” analysis, is the most comprehensive method for estimating hard-to-tally death counts — it has been used, for instance, to calculate the full global toll from the COVID-19 pandemic.For the Pacific Northwest heat wave, our excess deaths analysis represents the most complete accounting yet. In Washington state, it reveals that the heat wave likely killed more than 440 people there in the week ending July 3. And it suggests that another 230 or so people were killed that same week in Oregon — again more than that state’s list of 96 recorded heat wave deaths. Advertisement  The Pacific Northwest heat wave is just one example of how official sources are failing to account for the full toll from extreme weather. “I think it’s critically important that we know how destructive these events are, both in terms of capital losses and human losses — and we don’t,” John Mutter, an environmental and social scientist at Columbia University who studies the impacts of natural disasters, told BuzzFeed News. “We could be off by a long way.” Experts agree that there is currently no accurate national database accounting for the lives lost to extreme weather.With climate change already increasing the frequency or severity of deadly weather extremes, this official ignorance is a big and growing problem. “It’s extremely important, because you can’t manage something that you don’t measure,” Susan Cutter, who heads the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News.Solving this problem will require an overhaul of how deaths are recorded and sophisticated analytical methods to model the relationships between extreme weather and deaths. Right now, however, that isn’t a top priority for most state and federal agencies. By failing to account for the full toll so they can learn how to reduce it, government officials are missing chances to save hundreds or thousands of people from avoidable deaths, overheated or frozen in their homes or on the streets, or caught up in the chaos of a devastating storm.

In the US, the two main official sources of information on deaths related to extreme weather are NOAA’s Storm Event Database and the CDC, which is the main federal agency responsible for mortality statistics. On a global scale, severe weather deaths are tracked in an international database, EM-DAT, which covers a wide range of disasters from earthquakes to transport accidents, and is the World Meteorological Organization’s go-to source for information on deaths from weather and climate extremes.
 


This chart, derived from NOAA’s Storm Events Database, EM-DAT, and underlying causes of death recorded by the CDC from death certificates, shows how each source gives a different picture of the annual death toll in the US from extreme weather.“We have a problem here,” Debarati Guha-Sapir of the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, formerly director of its Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, which runs EM-DAT, told BuzzFeed News. “If the data is misleading, it can bring us a whole lot of grief, because conclusions can be wrong.”Much of the discrepancy in the leading databases arises from differences in their methods for tracking weather-related deaths. NOAA’s Storm Events Database starts from recorded weather events and then assesses the death toll mostly from numbers provided by local officials or reported in the media. EM-DAT takes a similar event-based approach — in its case looking at events in which 10 or more people died, 100 or more people were affected, or where a state of emergency was officially declared.The other leading approach, used by the CDC, is to compile counts from the causes listed on death certificates — possible because the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has a series of codes that relate to extreme weather, including “Exposure to excessive natural heat” and “Victim of flooding.” Advertisement  
 


The CDC’s numbers for extreme weather deaths are much higher. This is mainly due to its more complete accounting for deaths attributed to excessive natural cold or heat, which averaged 733 and 410 per year respectively from 2000 to 2020. Many people die from overheating or cold outside of extreme heat waves or cold snaps, so are missed by event-based methods.But as the system works right now, death certificates are also missing many fatalities from weather extremes. The CDC gets its data from the states, which in turn compile information from local coroners and medical examiners. And how they fill in death certificates is far from standardized.What gets recorded on a death certificate also typically misses the indirect ways in which storms and other severe weather events can kill, including deaths from traffic accidents as people evacuate, electrocution from downed power lines, or heart attacks from overexertion.The NOAA event-based database does try to account for those indirect deaths, as does EM-DAT. But the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather ripple out in ways that are hard to measure. “Displaced elderly people are very vulnerable,” said Mutter. “They lose track of what their medications are.”NOAA’s failure so far to recognize the full extent of what happened in Washington state during the summer heat wave shows how inadequate event-based recording can be. A NOAA spokesperson noted that the CDC “maintains the official government records on cause of death” and said that NOAA’s numbers for an event that happened almost six months ago were still “preliminary.”“The verification process for the heat wave in late June/early July is ongoing,” the NOAA spokesperson said by email.
 


Deaths can also accumulate over much longer periods than are typically considered by officials accounting for the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather. The most extreme example happened in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017. As cremations took place in the wake of the storm without being included in the official death count, nobody familiar with the situation on the ground believed the US territory’s official tally of just 64 deaths.The full toll was revealed only by comparing the number of deaths that occurred in previous years with the much higher numbers over the weeks that followed the storm, as Puerto Rico was hit by widespread power outages and disruptions to its healthcare system. In December 2017, the New York Times estimated that around 1,000 people more than expected had died in the six weeks after Maria made landfall. Finally, Puerto Rico’s governor commissioned a study from George Washington University, which estimated the storm-related death toll out to February 2018, coming up with a figure of 2,975.In reality, none of the official sources are hitting the right numbers. “I tell students and others to never trust a death toll, no matter who is estimating it,” Mutter said.As emergency managers and public health experts try to convince political leaders of the urgency of action to counter climate change and to reduce the impact of the severe weather it is brewing, the data gaps are becoming more pressing. “If you don’t capture the damage, there is no pressure you bring to bear,” Guha-Sapir said.
 


This year has shone a particularly harsh light on the deficiencies in official accounting for the toll from extreme weather. According to state and local counts, the winter storm that hit Texas in February and the Pacific Northwest heat wave were the two deadliest extreme weather events in the US this year — followed by the tornadoes that devastated parts of the South and Midwest over the night of Dec. 10–11 and Hurricane Ida and its remnants.But it took excess deaths analyses to reveal how bad the Texas freeze and Northwest heat wave really were. In May, BuzzFeed News estimated the true toll in Texas in February, which was hundreds more than the official count. Similar to methods used to investigate the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, we trained statistical models on mortality data that the CDC collects from individual states, which were then used to estimate the number of expected deaths in any week in any state. These models were reviewed by three independent experts in excess deaths analysis.We then compared the models’ predictions to the number of deaths that were actually recorded, after subtracting deaths attributed to COVID-19. (The models were trained on data from 2015 to 2019, before the pandemic hit.) Advertisement  In May, when the Texas Department of State Health Services was recording 151 winter storm deaths, we estimated that just over 700 more people than expected had died in Texas during the week of the storm and worst power outages. The state’s tally has since increased to 210. As more death certificate data has been transferred from Texas to the CDC, our analysis now estimates the excess death toll in the week ending Feb. 20 at more than 750.Our estimates for the Pacific Northwest heat wave, which suggest that around 670 people likely died as a result of the excessive heat across Washington and Oregon in the week ending July 3, were calculated in exactly the same way.The BuzzFeed News analysis of these events also underlined the shortcomings of relying on the underlying cause of deaths recorded on death certificates, as the spikes we identified were driven in large part by deaths attributed to causes other than exposure to cold or heat. Instead, many deaths triggered by the Texas freeze and by the heat wave in Washington were recorded as deaths from underlying medical conditions — in particular, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.That makes sense, as people who are already medically vulnerable are more likely to die if exposed to excessive cold or heat. But it means that the CDC’s counts of deaths from extreme weather based on ICD codes are missing an important part of the picture. “Underlying cause is certainly not always going to have the complete information,” Robert Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC, told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement  In some states and counties, recording deaths is the responsibility of coroners who may have no specialist medical training. What’s needed, experts told BuzzFeed News, is greater standardization in death reporting, including noting additional factors that contributed to someone’s death as well as an underlying cause.
 


Clearly, more sophisticated approaches are needed to track the true toll of extreme weather and climate change on human lives. “We have to modernize. We have to find new methods,” said Guha-Sapir. That includes excess deaths analysis, she added.Other insights can come from epidemiological studies that examine in detail the relationship between the number of recorded deaths in a given place and time, and extreme weather there.Where that has been done, estimates for deaths associated with extreme heat exceed the numbers recorded by the CDC from death certificates. In April 2020, researchers led by Kate Weinberger, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia, estimated that heat accounted for more than 5,600 deaths per year from 1997 to 2006 across some 300 counties. The area studied covered more than 60% of the US population. Advertisement  A national study of trends in heat deaths published in December 2020 from researchers led by Scott Sheridan, a climatologist at Kent State University in Ohio, used similar methods to show that progress in reducing heat deaths was stalling. This came after decades in decline, possibly due to the widespread adoption of air conditioning and better awareness of the risks. Among men ages 45 to 64 across parts of the South and Southwest, heat death rates were actually increasing.For wildfire smoke, one of the biggest single causes of weather- and climate-related deaths, epidemiological studies provide the only way of counting the dead.Studies that have modeled the long-term effects of breathing air laden with tiny particles from wildfire smoke indicate that thousands of Americans die every year as a result. Given the trend for larger and more intense wildfires driven by climate change, the number is forecast to double by the end of the century, according to a 2018 study from researchers led by Bonne Ford, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. This increasing toll from wildfire smoke is expected to partly offset public health gains from reducing other forms of air pollution.But you won’t find deaths from wildfire smoke listed in any official database. “When people talked about the costs of wildfires, it was all about the cost of fighting fires, damage to property, and direct deaths from the fire,” Ford told BuzzFeed News. “That’s the motivation for why we started doing these studies.” Advertisement  
 


Knowing how many people are dying from extreme weather is only the start. To reduce the toll, you also need to know which groups of the population are most vulnerable, and have a plan to protect them at times when the risks are most severe. In general, the burden falls most heavily on the less wealthy and on racial minorities: A study published in October from the CDC, based on ICD codes from death certificates, found that the death rate from natural disasters for Black people was 1.87 times times higher than for white people, while for Native Americans the rate was 7.34 times higher.The details vary from place to place, however. In Multnomah County, Oregon, which includes the city of Portland, the people hardest hit during this year’s heat wave were older, living alone, on higher floors of buildings, and with no air conditioning, according to the county’s public health director, Jessica Guernsey. Advertisement     But in Maricopa County in Arizona, home to some 4.5 million people who live in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and where almost every day in the summer brings life-threatening heat, the risk profile is very different. There, the typical victim is a man without regular shelter in his 40s or 50s with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. Often people die from exposure to heat after overdosing, said David Hondula, who in September was appointed to head the city of Phoenix’s new Heat Response & Mitigation Office. “It’s that story over and over and over again,” Hondula told BuzzFeed News.The Maricopa County Department of Public Health is one of the most thorough in the nation at recording deaths from extreme heat. Yet the toll there has been steadily rising. In 2020, Maricopa County recorded 323 heat-associated deaths, an increase of more than 60% from 2019, and 15 times the number recorded in 2001. If reducing heat mortality is the “barometer for success,” Hondula said, “we are failing.”Given the link between these deaths and substance abuse, Hondula’s office is now considering measures that — without the data at its disposal — might seem unconnected to the dangers of excessive heat. One idea is to equip volunteers with the Phoenix Community Emergency Response Team with Narcan, the emergency treatment for opioid overdoses. Advertisement     
 


If cities and states across the nation are to reduce the death toll from extreme weather, they will need to overhaul their methods for counting the dead, develop better systems to recognize when emergency plans need to be activated, and have a comprehensive approach to reducing the risks for the most vulnerable people.“There’s a whole suite of hazard mitigation that can come into play,” said Cutter. “We need better preparedness. We need better warning systems. We need to do some interventions such as adding more greenery to cities.” The last measure can help reduce the urban heat islands that can turn poorer neighborhoods into death traps in the summer as asphalt and concrete absorb the sun’s heat. Advertisement     As the Pacific Northwest heat wave showed, responding to the reality of climate change may mean dealing with events that exceed anything that has come before. Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who studies health risks from climate change, has advocated for “stress testing,” in which local health agencies, emergency responders, and other stakeholders conduct war game–like exercises to consider how to respond to hypothetical extreme weather outside of their previous experience.But there are formidable structural and political obstacles to overcome. “I’ve never believed numbers from a state agency. They always have reasons to exaggerate or diminish,” Mutter of Columbia University said. When it comes to getting aid from the federal government, states have a vested interest in stressing how hard they were hit by a disaster. But when the death toll is largely due to failures in a state’s own infrastructure or planning, the incentive works the other way.Deaths from extreme cold in Texas in February are a case in point. Several states were hit by the winter storm that swept through the region around Valentine’s Day weekend. But only Texas experienced a large spike in deaths, after its power grid failed. This came a decade after the state had been warned by federal officials that its power infrastructure was vulnerable to cold, after narrowly escaping a similar disaster in 2011. Advertisement     The CDC, meanwhile, has been working with the National Association of Medical Examiners to try and improve the recording of deaths following natural disasters, and has online training materials that encourage coroners, medical examiners, and physicians to take a broader view of what gets recorded as a disaster-related death. But with responsibility for recording deaths lying with local and state authorities, the CDC is limited to an advisory role — it has no direct power to change how deaths are recorded at the local level.
 


And while several federal agencies have offices focusing on climate and health, there has so far been no concerted effort across the US government to better account for the lives lost to extreme weather. “It’s nobody’s responsibility,” Ebi said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is charged with making sure the US is prepared to withstand and respond to major disasters, but has “not really been part of the picture,” Ebi added.“We know that extreme weather is a matter of life or death,” Jaclyn Rothenberg, FEMA’s director of public affairs, told BuzzFeed News by email. “As emergency management continues to evolve to meet the demands of our changing climate, it will continue to necessitate us to become more advanced in the ways we understand and react to extreme weather.”After a year of successive weather disasters, which have exposed both the fragility of US infrastructure and the nation’s inability to count the lives lost, experts say there should be an urgent focus on improving data gathering and acting on that information.Right now, they warn, local, state, and federal agencies are in the dark, flying into a major storm, as climate change threatens an even more hazardous future.“Disasters are windows of opportunity to make change,” Ebi said. But the tragedy is that officials often only start planning for weather extremes after the bodies start piling up. “Until it’s in their face, it tends to not happen.” ●Zahra Hirji contributed reporting for this story.

Red RocketIt’s probably just me, but lately it feels like storytelling has been taken over by Marvel universes and absurd streaming-bait about feline subcultures and hetero masochism. I miss quieter movies with their slow-build character studies. Watching director Sean Baker’s Red Rocket, a portrait of fictional aging porn actor Mikey Saber (Simon Rex), was a reminder of how great those can be. Advertisement     Baker wanted to capture the energy of “suitcase pimps,” porn impresarios he met while researching the adult industry for his 2012 film Starlet. And he found the perfect vehicle in Rex, a former model, MTV VJ, and white rapper known as Dirt Nasty who’s spent a lifetime around deluded LA actors, to masterfully bring the archetype to life.In the film, Mikey returns to his small Texas town, which he’d left after convincing girlfriend Lexi (Bree Elrod) to move to LA and become a porn star with him. Now his estranged wife, she’s back in town, staying with her mom and stuck in a dead-end life.Mikey is a compelling presence from the moment he appears onscreen, begging Lexi and her mom Lil (Brenda Deiss) to let him crash with them while he gets back on his feet. Soon he’s resettling into his old life, quickly finding his lane as a weed dealer, and we get snippets of his backstory as he reconnects with locals. As his moods shift, from whiny boy to daydreaming pothead and then to entitled harebrained schemer — and around again — the film really gives a sense of how circular his life is.Without shying away from the darkness, the script finds the comedy of how some men exist in a kind of perpetual nowness, parasitically living off everyone around them, especially women — even, eventually, and queasily, a 17-year-old named Strawberry (Suzanna Son). Advertisement     For all the acclaim about Baker’s ability to capture outsider class and gender perspectives, I find that the least convincing and most gimmicky aspect of his work — especially in 2015’s Tangerine. But he’s finally found a perfect muse in Mikey, and this memorable portrait of the amoral ruthlessness of a small-town con artist is some of his best work yet. —Alessa DominguezWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Licorice PizzaPaul Thomas Anderson’s newest film, Licorice Pizza, is a delightful coming-of-age romp that could certainly be called a rom-com if PTA made rom-coms. Set in 1970s Encino, the film stars Philip Seymour Hoffman’s son Cooper as Gary Valentine, a fast-talking 15-year-old child star who is constantly reinventing himself to make money and be the kind of man twentysomething Alana (Alana Haim) would want to date. The will-they-won’t-they serves as the spine of this story, but this charming film is really a love letter to the Valley, packed with a cast of offbeat characters (keep an eye out for a cameo from Leonardo DiCaprio’s dad) that are as memorable as those found in PTA’s other Golden Age valley epic, Boogie Nights. Bradley Cooper is hilarious as Jon Peters, hairstylist/producer/boyfriend of Barbra Streisand, and Sean Penn is spot-on as a washed-up William Holden. (Along with much critical praise, the film is also garnering controversy for the nature of its central relationship and how Anderson handled racism in the scenes regarding a particular Valley restaurant.) This film — which is as sprawling as the Valley it tries to capture — will command a second (and third) watch. —Karolina WaclawiakWhere to watch: Now playing in New York, Los Angeles, and Austin.

West Side StoryI’m torn because there have been convincing arguments about why West Side Story isn’t worth reviving, given its racist origin story, but I did really enjoy this film adaptation of the 1957 musical and 1961 movie. Director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner rehabilitate some of the original’s worst tendencies with renewed attention to setting and history. Robert Moses and his “slum clearance” projects loom over the production; when the Sharks and the Jets fight in the beginning of the movie, we see blood. Latinx folks play the Puerto Rican parts, undoing the brownface travesty of the original movie. Ultimately, though, it’s the performances that won me over: Ariana Debose is electrifying as Anita, David Alvarez is hot as Bernardo, and Mike Faist weirdly moving as Riff. And the presence of 90-year-old Rita Moreno, in a role written specifically for her, is especially heartening. Yes, the plot is still kind of risible, but I left the theater teary-eyed. —Tomi ObaroWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


PassingI was so amped to see Passing, starring Tessa Thompson and Ruth Negga, that in the weeks leading up to the film’s premiere in November, I decided to read the book. Author Nella Larsen’s source material was an excellent primer for actor-turned-writer/director Rebecca Hall’s film, set mostly during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and ’30s, gorgeously captured in black and white.The story focuses primarily on Irene and Clare, played respectively by Thompson and Negga. The women haven’t spoken to one another since they were children, but one hot summer day they unexpectedly reunite in the tea room of a hotel, taking refuge from the sun. What’s immediately clear from the outset is that the women have chosen two wildly different paths for their lives. While both characters are Black women with fair skin, Clare has decided to live her life passing as a white woman. Advertisement     Passing, like the novel it shares a name with, is layered. Though you may be expecting a simple story about the dangers of passing for another race, the film allows the audience to consider other questions beyond surface-level observations. Instead of condemning Clare’s choice to live as a white woman, the film raises questions around why someone might choose a life of exile from their people. Meanwhile, Irene lives a charmed life in Harlem, and the audience experiences the story through her perspective. She lives as a Black woman but has passed from time to time herself in situations one may deem harmless or inconsequential — this may not make her and Clare one and the same, but the parallels add complexity to her point of view. Irene finds fault with Clare's decision because of its inherent danger, but the ease with which Irene herself has chosen to selectively pass in her own life demonstrates how seductive, and limiting, that choice can be.The film isn’t only about race and its contradictions. It’s also about class and community, and the stifling boxes we have created for ourselves. Passing is one of the must-see films of 2021, one that will stay in your mind well after the credits have begun to roll. —Michael BlackmonWhere to watch: Netflix
 


The Power of the DogIn The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion’s first feature since 2009’s Bright Star, two very different brothers come to blows about the best way to run their family’s ranch — and their lives — in 1920s Montana. Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) is greatly displeased when, during a cattle drive, his brother George (Jesse Plemons) becomes smitten with a widowed inn owner named Rose (Kirsten Dunst). She’s the mother of a sweet, gangly, effeminate young man, Peter (the extraordinary Kodi Smit-McPhee), and when she and George marry, Phil makes it his mission to bully and unsettle his new family members: Rose, because he thinks she’s after George’s money, and Peter because of his lisp and gentle ways. Advertisement     This is a gorgeous, smoldering film with an all-star ensemble cast, anchored by Cumberbatch playing against type as the towering and quietly terrifying Phil. A haunting score by Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood leads the audience through the awesome tableaus of the American West (New Zealand, technically) and drip-feeds us with a mounting sense of isolation and dread. It’s a slow build, and for most of the time, I had no idea where this was all heading — which only made its shocking but well-earned ending all the more gratifying. —Shannon KeatingWhere to watch: Netflix
 


BenedettaI knew that a film about lesbian nuns from the director who brought us gloriously unhinged classics like 1995’s Showgirls would be right up my alley, but I still wasn’t prepared for just how much I’d enjoy Paul Verhoeven’s rollicking new nunsploitation flick, Benedetta.Virginie Efira, the absolutely stunning, César-winning Belgian actor, plays the title character, who arrives at an Italian convent as a young girl and grows up to believe — or so she’ll have us think — that she’s been granted strange, grand visions from heaven. Some of the convent leadership are pleased that talk of miracles will bring more fortune and fame to the abbey, but others aren’t convinced that Benedetta’s telling the whole truth about what she sees.Meanwhile, a new nun named Bartolomea (Daphné Patakia) begins to distract Benedetta from her sexy dreams of Jesus through seductions of her own. The women begin an illicit affair, which involves, delightfully, a small statue of the Virgin Mary repurposed as a 17th-century dildo. They’re threatened with discovery as the plague draws ever nearer to the convent’s walls. Will Benedetta’s personal relationship with God spare their Tuscan town from mass death, or will her forbidden sapphism be both her and the village’s demise? You’re going to want to find out — trust me. —Shannon KeatingWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Drive My CarRyusuke Hamaguchi’s Drive My Car has already landed plenty of awards (mostly the kind with “best international” attached) and at least one major American laurel (it’s on Barack Obama’s yearly favorite movies list). It has also inspired a healthy number of adoring online jokes from cinephiles, which is a little surprising given it’s a Japanese movie with a runtime of almost three hours about death, loss, and [glances at notes] the plays of Anton Chekhov.Yet there’s no mystery about its appeal. Languorous like life itself, the film is split into two parts. The first introduces the gentle rhythms of theater actor and director Yusuke Kafuku’s existence. Yusuke seems satisfied: His creative output is distinctive and well-received, and he shares a loving relationship with his wife. But returning home one day, he discovers with a shock that his world stands on shaky ground, and shortly afterward, his wife dies unexpectedly.Two years later, Yusuke is invited to direct Uncle Vanya for a festival in Hiroshima. After a former director’s accident, the festival won’t allow Yusuke to drive to work, instead hiring a laconic young woman named Misaki as his chauffeur. This is just one of the jarring disruptions to his stasis; another is a young actor whose presence reminds him of what he’s lost. With the status quo so disturbed, Yusuke’s grief turns from a quiet anchor into dead weight.Drive My Car shows people devastated by loss, allowing time to ripen those wounds and distort their understanding of love and purpose. For these characters, avoiding suffering has been a necessity; it’s enabled them to keep going, but at a cost. Dealing with this kind of loss requires the deepest bravery; Drive My Car is a film that bears witness to the grief process, one of the most common and transformative things we ever face. —Estelle TangWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Nine DaysWhat makes a life worth living? How do you decide if a life is well-lived? These are the central questions behind Nine Days, the feature debut from director Edson Oda. I saw it in August, and it’s been rattling around my brain ever since. Nine Days follows Will (Winston Duke) as he goes about his job: He is an arbiter, tasked with the responsibility of interviewing souls and deciding which will get the opportunity to go to earth and inhabit a human body.While the premise is supernatural, the mechanics of Nine Days are rooted in the triumphs and traumas of humanity. Will is forced to confront what he values about life as he cycles through the candidates for the job. Should he select the soul least likely to suffer? The one most likely to withstand the brutality of existence? Or the soul most oriented to softness and fragility? Will wrestles with these questions as he tries to process a tragic loss in his life.What makes Nine Days work is its ability to resist descending into a full-blown philosophy lesson. Instead, this film breathes and creates space for these questions while letting the characters inhabit their own tragedies. There’s a lot of restraint here, which makes more room for the film’s striking emotionality. In addition to a stunning performance from Zazie Beetz, Nine Days also features Benedict Wong, Tony Hale, and Bill Skarsgård. —Elamin AbdelmahmoudWhere to watch: Amazon Prime
 


House of GucciListen, I know. I know a lot of great movies came out this year, like the one about the adult woman who spends way too much time with a teenage boy in the ’70s or the one about Princess Diana if everyone did ketamine. I know! I get it! Movies are art! I do not really like art, I’ve recently decided; suffice to say the pandemic (and being alive through it) has given my brain a very soft, almost gummy worm–like quality, and as such, I cannot tolerate any movies that require me to think. I’m sure The Green Knight is very good, but the fact that I’m not typing out these sentences as “me like moobies, moobies fun for no thinky” is really a feat of personal strength. Advertisement     You know when I didn’t have to think? Throughout the entire 158 minutes of House of Gucci. The reviews are largely true: The film’s pacing is so chaotic you barely feel time pass at all, it’s an extended fashion show for the Gucci catalog (and, I guess, whatever suede couch Jared Leto is cosplaying as), and Lady Gaga is the only redeeming quality of the whole movie. Why was everyone so hard on her Italian accent when this movie features Leto yelling “Boof!”I’m not saying House of Gucci is “good,” but I am saying that it made me and my friend laugh so hard in the theater that we had to shove our masks into our mouths so that we wouldn’t get kicked out. It is an eminently watchable movie that drifts on by with a few moments of good acting, but even more moments of absolute camp. There’s one really boring movie in House of Gucci, about the business of a struggling fashion house that everyone knows isn’t struggling anymore. But then there’s a far better narrative inside, about Gaga’s character, a jilted wife who builds her husband (Adam Driver) and his business up, who is cast aside when he’s no longer compelled by her, and then driven to plotting his murder. The tedious part gives you time to look at Instagram and the compelling parts will distract you from the crushing reality of your life. Isn’t that all we really want from the movies? Brain soft, Gucci soothing, and that’s all she wrote. —Scaachi KoulWhere to watch: In theaters now
"
269,"Even when Joan Didion wrote about something as personal as her divorce, she did it at a remove, turning it over in her hand, polishing it to a shine that concealed certain roughnesses in the center.","


By 1964, just three years after she started writing searching personal essays for Vogue, Joan Didion was plainly itching to write about something other than herself. Her life was also changing. She had published a slim novel, Run River, whose journey to the bookstore had been a grand disappointment. The title had been chosen by the publisher, and the editor had altered the form of the novel entirely, changing its experimental structure into something quite conventional. She had also married John Gregory Dunne, a sometime friend, after he’d supported her through the end of a long love affair. The pair decided to quit their magazine jobs and move to California, where they had a vague plan to make careers in television.Vogue, apparently unwilling to cut apron strings altogether, asked Didion to begin reviewing films for it. In her opening column for 1964, written just a month before she married, Didion declared her critical approach would be somewhat democratic:Let me lay it on the line: I like movies, and approach them with a tolerance so fond that it will possibly strike you as simple-minded. To engage my glazed attention a movie need be no classic of its kind, need be neither L’Avventura or Red River, neither Casablanca nor Citizen Kane; I ask only that it have its moments.She went on to cast positive votes for The Philadelphia Story, The Spirit of St Louis, and Charade. Pauline Kael had not yet quite broken through to mainstream movie reviewing and I Lost It at the Movies hadn’t yet been published, but we can see in Didion’s words a relatively similar approach. She too would spend her career insisting there were moments of brilliance even in what was unquestionably trash.
 


Didion alternated her assignment on the movies with another writer, which seems to have prevented her from reviewing memorable films. She was trying to write with flair, though, in short spaces, and most of the reviews are sprightly, wisecracking things that seem more like Parker than Didion. She hated The Pink Panther: “possibly the only seduction ever screened (David Niven vs. The Princess) with all the banality of the real thing.” She liked The Unsinkable Molly Brown, but commented that Debbie Reynolds “tends to play these things as if the West was won by jumping up and down and shouting at it.” She confessed a weakness for teenage surfing movies, “an enthusiasm I should try to pass off as sociological.” Like Kael, she too hated The Sound of Music, calling it:More embarrassing than most, if only because of its suggestion that history need not happen to people like Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. Just whistle a happy tune, and leave the Anschluss behind.Gradually, though, Didion got bored with film reviews. Her review of The Sound of Music was so caustic that Vogue fired her, as she tells it. (This was another connection to Kael, who had been fired for panning the same movie at McCall’s.) In any event, she was moving on to other subjects in a column that she and Dunne soon set up at the Saturday Evening Post.
 


At the Post, Didion’s writing would undergo a major shift in tone, too. There are hints of the elegiac, distinctive earlier Didion voice in “On Self-Respect,” and in another essay she wrote for Vogue on American summers. But, given the Post’s willingness to send her into the field, she found a groove. It helped that California of the 1960s was fertile ground for twisting stories that provided Didion with the opportunity to follow a disturbing note longer than a column or two. She started off writing for the Post about Helen Gurley Brown (whom she found silly) and John Wayne (whom she did not), but it was the first of the crime pieces that hit a chord with the magazine’s readers — and also reads as the first true Didion piece.It was titled “How Can I Tell Them There’s Nothing Left?” But the title Didion would give it in her own collection, “Some Dreamers of the Golden Dream,” was the one that would stick. Nominally chronicling a local murder, in which a wife was accused of burning her husband to death in the family car, Didion immediately pulled back to a wide-angle view of everything that was plaguing California, not to mention most of the rest of America:This is the California where it is easy to Dial-a-Devotion, but hard to buy a book. This is the country in which a belief in the literal interpretation of Genesis has slipped imperceptibly into a belief in the literal interpretation of Double Indemnity, the country of the teased hair and the Capris and the girls for whom all life’s promise comes down to a waltz-length white wedding dress and the birth of a Kimberly or a Sherry or a Debbi and a Tijuana divorce and a return to hairdresser’s school.The woman was eventually convicted of murdering her husband, but naturally the residents of the San Bernardino valley—the part of California Didion was describing in that long, unwinding opening paragraph—did not take kindly to being characterized this way. “I am worried about Joan Didion,” wrote one Howard B. Weeks, who also listed his profession: vice president for public relations and development at Loma Linda University. “We recognize these feelings as symptoms commonly observed in young New York writers who venture into the Great Unknown beyond the Hudson.” This letter illustrates that Didion hadn’t quite yet broken through to the mainstream; Howard B. Weeks did not know he was lecturing the woman who would become the signature American writer from California on the subject of her own home.Didion did not slide into her groove immediately. The next piece she wrote seemed almost a step away from anything that could possibly annoy anyone. It was entitled “The Big Rock Candy Figgy Pudding Pitfall.” Despite her having savaged Helen Gurley Brown and J. D. Salinger for being essentially trivial persons, one guesses this was the kind of piece Didion wrote for money. It details an effort to cook twenty figgy puddings and make twenty hard-candy trees. But it seemed to reflect a state of distress about how her domestic arrangements were working out:I am frail, lazy and unsuited to doing anything except what I am paid to do, which is sit by myself and type with one finger. I like to imagine myself a “can-do” kind of woman, capable of patching the corral fence, pickling enough peaches to feed the hands all winter, and then winning a trip to Minneapolis in the Pillsbury Bake-Off. In fact, the day I stop believing that if put to it I could win the Pillsbury Bake-Off will signal the death of something.Dunne appears in this article as a benevolent, comic figure, who upon confrontation with the supplies asks, “Exactly what kind of therapy are we up to this week?” But nowhere in this article does Didion mention that earlier that year, she and Dunne had adopted a child they named Quintana Roo Dunne. The anxiety, though, about being some kind of domestic goddess—“the kind of woman who made hard-candy topiary trees and figgy puddings”—smells of what the women’s magazines all call nesting.
 


For one of the first issues of the new year, she wrote an essay the magazine entitled “Farewell to the Enchanted City.” (Later generations of readers would come to know it better by the title “Goodbye to All That.”) This was when the first hint of her career-long obsession with the stories we tell ourselves would begin to explicitly emerge. Didion suggests that the New York of her imagination had dominated the real one the whole time she actually lived there:Some instinct, programmed by all the movies I had ever seen and all the songs I had ever heard about New York, informed me that it would never be quite the same again. In fact it never was. Some time later there was a song in the jukeboxes on the Upper East Side that went “but where is the schoolgirl who used to be me,” and if it was late enough at night I used to wonder that. I know now that almost everyone wonders something like that, sooner or later and no matter what he or she is doing, but one of the mixed blessings of being twenty and twenty-one and even twenty-three is the conviction that nothing like this, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, has ever happened to anyone before.
 


This essay is so famous it is said to have spawned its own mini genre of essays about leaving New York. Like the song on the jukebox, it expresses the feelings everyone has about a common experience. The brilliance of the essay is that even in the act of writing it Didion reenacts an emotional cliché, the narrator telling a past self how silly and stupid she was to fall for a story that everyone falls for. This self-conscious style, a personal matter conveyed at a distance, would become Didion’s signature. Even when she wrote about something as personal as her divorce, she did it at a remove, turning it over in her hand, polishing it to a shine that concealed certain roughnesses in the center.Dunne and Didion soon had a regular column in the Saturday Evening Post, sharing a byline. It looks odd to contemporary eyes, especially because of the illustration the magazine used at the top of each column, drawings of them both. If Dunne had written the column, the illustration would show his face in front of Didion’s; if she had written it, her face would move in front of his.Her columns were generally the more interesting explorations of the pair, her knack for inspiring a reaction was top-notch. Her essay on migraines would appear in that space, as would her reporting of a decommissioned Alcatraz and a devastating sketch of Nancy Reagan, then the first lady of California:She has told me that the governor never wore makeup even in motion pictures and that politics is rougher than the picture business because you do not have the studio to protect you . . . “Having a pretty place to work is important to a man,” she has advised me. She has shown me the apothecary jar of hard candies she keeps filled on the governor’s desk.Almost a month later, Nancy Reagan was still smarting from the sting, telling the Fresno Bee, “I thought we were getting along fine together. Maybe it would have been better if I snarled a bit.”This technique—appearing to let the subject simply carry on without interruption from Didion’s evaluations or thoughts making themselves absurd—became her standard mode of operation. It would be the way she would spend large swaths of her famous explorations in Haight-Ashbury. She would begin the essay with a long incantation about how the “center was not holding,” then trek into the widening abyss to find people who would reveal themselves in a line or two. Meeting two young Deadheads, for example:I ask a couple of girls what they do. “I just kind of come out here a lot,” one of them says. “I just sort of know the Dead,” the other says.The flatness of these answers spoke for the emptiness of those who spoke them. Most of the readers of the Saturday Evening Post agreed with Didion on this point, the letters unusually full of praise for her insight into the barbarians of the hippie cult, as it was popular to call them at the time. There were some objectors, like Sunnie “The Daisy” Brentwood, who continued to insist that “the majority of the flower children are good kids who are trying to improve the world and make it a better place to live.”
 


Didion’s view won out in the end, not least because this essay would become the title piece of her stand-alone 1968 collection Slouching Towards Bethlehem, the book that established Didion’s reputation. Reviewing it for the New York Times, Didion’s friend Dan Wakefield argued that Didion was “one of the least celebrated and most talented writers of my own generation.” He pointed out that Didion was easier to interpret, for example, than another trendy young woman writer of the moment named Susan Sontag. Wakefield’s thorough celebration of the book was echoed by just about every reviewer. Some of them stumbled over the pairing of Didion’s brilliance with her gender: Melvin Maddocks of the Christian Science Monitor cryptically remarked, in what appeared to be a compliment:Journalism by women is the price the man’s world pays for having disappointed them. Here at their best are the unforgiving eye, the unforgetting ear, the concealed hat-pin style.That is one way of looking at it; though the reference to hat pins is clearly trivializing, the notion that the opinions were a “price” rather than a gift is somewhat revealing. Didion had cultivated a persona in her writing that was just as disappointed with women—Gurley Brown, the Deadheads, Nancy Reagan, the figgy pudding domestics—as it was with the “man’s world,” wherever that was. It wasn’t feminine so much as just perceptive, sharp. Certain doors of perception are more open to women, but it doesn’t mean that men can’t see what women are pointing out, if only they’d settle down, listen, and look.After Slouching Towards Bethlehem, the literary profilers came out of the woodwork. In droves, they began to interview her, attaching the beautiful photographs of her slight frame to headlines like “Joan Didion: Writer with Razor’s Edge,” and “Slouching Towards Joan Didion.” It was by then the 1970s. Alfred Kazin, that old friend of Hannah Arendt’s, promptly got himself assigned to fly out to California. He met the Didion-Dunnes in high spirits at the house they then occupied in Malibu, together writing a screenplay based on Play It as It Lays, her 1970 novel about a dissatisfied actress named Maria Wyeth that had gotten her rave reviews. Kazin noted the difference between the way Didion often spoke of herself in print: as fragile, ill, on the verge of divorce in a famous Life column in 1969, and the way she was in person, more a creature of sensible steel than frivolous silk:Joan Didion is a creature of many advantages, as is clear from her own belief that she had the sense to get born and to grow up in Sacramento before so many discomfiting things began to happen to the Golden State.Kazin continued to catalog discrepancies. Didion’s voice was “so much stronger than her own little girl’s voice!” Though the address in Malibu would seem to connote relaxation, he finds the sound of the waves below deafening: “People who live in a beach house don’t know how wary it makes them.” He called her a moralist, pointed out that she had an obsession with seriousness. He notes that always she was writing as a cultural critic, even in fiction, wanting to diagnose the ills of whatever subject she had—a propensity she shared with Mary McCarthy, though their fiction voices are far apart. He even connected her with Arendt, who had once told him that Americans seemed to despair far more than she had ever seen people do in Europe.By the time Kazin’s profile was published, Didion was, quite simply, a star. But the Saturday Evening Post, the place that had let her write lyrically about migraines, about going home to Sacramento, or that flew her to Hawaii for a piece, had folded. She looked for other homes. Life magazine offered her a contract to write a column. But the relationship soured immediately; Didion asked to go to Saigon, because many writers—including Sontag and McCarthy—had already been there. Her editor demurred, telling her that “some of the guys are going out.” Her anger at this blithe dismissal turned into the now-famous column she wrote about visiting Hawaii during the prediction of a huge tidal wave:My husband switches off the television set and stares out the window. I avoid his eyes, and brush the baby’s hair. In the absence of a natural disaster we are left again to our own uneasy devices. We are here on this island in the middle of the Pacific in lieu of filing for divorce.
 


This essay poses as self-revelation, but here the frame of marital trouble dissolves. Didion begins telling you instead how disconnected she had felt from everything, how difficult it was to feel. She confesses that she has become, as that old boyfriend predicted, someone who feels nothing. The piece is so relentlessly dark and despairing it is no wonder the Life editors were apparently startled by it. They gave it a title that reflected their bewilderment: “A Problem of Making Connections.” Subsequent deeply personal columns were not to their taste either, and Didion would end up relinquishing the contract before it was up because the editors would not run her column. She would get back at the editor for his nonchalant remark many years later, when she’d report it in The Year of Magical Thinking.This hints at something important about Didion’s work: even when she is reporting unendurable despair, feeling that her life is falling apart alongside the country’s, another engine is at work there. No person as depressed and lost as Didion purports to be could possibly draft prose this precise, words that cut so directly to the heart of her subject. In the case of the confession of her potential divorce, the engine behind it was anger, anger at having been prevented from using the full measure of her powers by an editor who considered Joan Didion less daring a writer than the “guys” going out to Saigon. It was a mistake that belongs in the museum of poor editorial decisions.Didion returned to novel writing. She occasionally contributed to Esquire, but had trouble fitting in there too. She was one of the boys, clearly, in the sense that men had noticed her writing and wanted to publish her. But she also couldn’t quite fit into their regime.Still, turning to the women’s magazines would have been intolerable for her, just when the women’s liberation movement was at its height. Like Sontag, she was no doubt being asked about her loyalty to the consciousness-raising circles that were suddenly everywhere. But she does not seem to have directly commented until finally, in 1972, she published an essay called “The Women’s Movement” in the pages of the New York Times. She listed sixteen books as inspiration. But she had clearly been moved to frustration by the “special issue on women” that Time had published some months before.Didion was not willing to grant much ground or sense to the nascent second wave of feminism. She leveled some of the most direct insults of her career at it. “It seemed very New England, this febrile and cerebral passion,” she said of the radical feminist writings of Shulamith Firestone. She referred to some of the movement’s methods as Stalinist, singling out the British writer Juliet Mitchell’s relation of Maoist practice to the consciousness-raising session. She also defended Mary McCarthy from those feminist theorists who would deconstruct her heroines in The Company She Keeps and The Group into an unrecognizable, overly politicized caricature: “enslaved because she persists in looking for her identity in a man.”
 


Yet there was something less than a total rejection of the notion of feminism going on in Didion’s article. She presented herself as merely worried that what she sweepingly saw as one unified movement had become mired in arguments over trivial issues, like the division of domestic duties such as washing the dishes.Of course this litany of trivia was crucial to the movement in the beginning, a key technique in the politicizing of women who perhaps had been conditioned to obscure their resentments even from themselves . . . But such discoveries could be of no use at all if one refused to perceive the larger point, failed to make that inductive leap from the personal to the political.Didion also thought that in their books the feminists had constructed a kind of self-delusion, one she called Everywoman, “persecuted even by her gynecologist,” “raped on every date.” Didion did not deny that women were victims of condescension and sex-role stereotyping. Indeed, it’s hard to imagine how she could, given the way she was written about in the period, given her inability to fit tidily into the male-dominated magazine world. But she found the expressed wishes of the main movement writers to be childish in the extreme. “These are converts who want not a revolution but ‘romance,’” she concluded.Didion had addressed the condition of women several times before, often in the context of writing about Doris Lessing. She wrote about her twice: once for Vogue and once for the New York Times Book Review. In Vogue, she’d had only enough space to say she did not share Lessing’s view that there was some “injustice” involved in being a woman. By the time Didion was enlisted to review the science fiction novel Briefing for a Descent into Hell, she had softened her view of Lessing, in part because Lessing had softened her view of feminist politics by then. Briefing, which as Lessing termed it, was an “inner space fiction,” was more about madness and alienation than about a critique of modern social structures. And while Didion didn’t particularly like it, she went out of her way to congratulate Lessing on what she saw as Lessing’s disenchantment with all blunt forms of political thought and action, as Didion saw feminism to be:The impulse to find solutions has been not only her dilemma but the guiding delusion of her time. It is not an impulse I hold high, but there is something finally very moving about Mrs. Lessing’s tenacity.There’s a little daylight between Didion and her rejection of feminism, here. It seemed, in a cloaked way, that she had some sympathy for the aims and hopes of those feminists whose tactics and writing she still detested. It was not much, but it was something.This is something that could not really be said for the other side. Several feminist activists wrote to the Times to complain, among them Susan Brownmiller, whose Against Our Will had been listed as one of the books examined in the essay. Pointing out that Didion had never exactly positioned herself as a leftist, and had written for the National Review, Brownmiller cryptically continued:Isn’t it interesting that the real toughies are always on the other side? I’ll take boots and blue jeans over manicured, Mandarin fingernails any day of the week.The piece would cut Didion forever out of the women’s movement. In fact, it inaugurated a common complaint about her: that she was, in her own way, acting out a certain kind of stereotypical femininity. And for all her defense of complexity, she was afraid to recognize that there were any number of interior ideological fights going on in the movement she was describing: the novelist Alix Kates Shulman was on one side of the fence, and the tract-writer Shulamith Firestone on another. But in Didion’s view they were all the same, all the Everywoman, all capable of making different choices from the ones they had made.For the rest of the 1970s, Didion mostly threw herself into film-making and fiction. She and Dunne would work on a film version of Play It as It Lays, as well as an update of A Star Is Born. She published A Book of Common Prayer. She had the occasional article in Esquire, but her energy seemed subdued. The Didion-Dunnes, who had avoided divorce more than once in the intervening years, were great party givers, and that took up time too. It wouldn’t be until the end of the decade that she’d publish a second collection of nonfiction called The White Album.
 


The title essay, “The White Album,” which begins with the famous incantation, “We tell ourselves stories in order to live,” is a fragmentary bit of work. Though that first line is often quoted as a kind of self-help mantra, in the essay proper Didion goes on to list delusional fantasies, finally concluding that writers especially are guilty of imposing a kind of narrative order on existence that simply “freeze[s] the shifting phantasmagoria of our experience.”Some of the elements of the essay included projects that Didion had tried to take up, and which had failed, over the years. Specifically, she mentions an acquaintance with Linda Kasabian, the twenty-three-year-old member of the Manson family who had driven the car when a group of them murdered Sharon Tate and her houseguests in August 1969.On the outside, the Kasabian story had looked like a perfect Didion subject. Here was a person who had gotten caught up in the promises of love and grooviness that were the allure of the hippie movement—the promises that, as Didion had written, at length, were bogus. Kasabian had gone so far that she got caught up in the most notorious murders in America, murders so savage they stood out in a country that treated crime as nighttime entertainment. But Didion never got the project under way. Instead the Manson murders, and Linda Kasabian, became another dreamlike element in the political and social morass of the late 1960s, years when Didion would write that she barely knew her own mind:I remember all the day’s misinformation very clearly, and I also remember this, and wish I did not. I remember that no one was surprised.In The White Album, Didion never says what shook her out of her misery at the morally and philosophically empty conditions of the 1960s, not exactly. It could have been the films she was making, or that she was finally being recognized as a proper novelist. A Book of Common Prayer was very well received. It could be that without the violence and anomie of the 1960s, she found herself enjoying life suddenly. Quintana was growing up, her marriage got past its rough point, and she was making good money.
 


It was in the 1970s that she got very lucky. She met an editor who, like her old ones at the Saturday Evening Post, was prepared to let her talent work for itself in nonfiction articles. Bob Silvers, who was now one of the two lead editors of the New York Review of Books, was happy to let Didion roam over the pages of the magazine. Her first piece was nominally a review of Stanley Kauffmann’s film criticism in the New Republic, though Didion had other targets in mind:I used to wonder how Pauline Kael, say, could slip in and out of such airy subordinate clauses as “now that the studios are collapsing,” or how she could so misread the labyrinthine propriety of Industry evenings as to characterize “Hollywood wives” as women “whose jaws get a hard set from the nights when they sit soberly at parties waiting to take their sloshed geniuses home.”Didion proceeded to mock those, like Kael and Kauffmann, who wrote about film without having any idea how a film was produced and made. She said the most they could hope for was to bring a specific brand of intelligence to film, but that it was “a kind of petit-point-on-Kleenex effect which rarely stands much scrutiny.”Kauffmann, upon reading the review, discovered that in fact he was little-mentioned in it, and that four of the quotes Didion used had come from an entirely different book he had written. He wrote in to the New York Review to state his objection, and added:A possible reason: In the December 9, 1972, issue of the New Republic, I reviewed Miss Didion’s film Play It as It Lays, referred to her novel of that name, and stated my utter loathing of both. (On much the same grounds that she substantiates in her article: the film pretended to deal with serious subjects but was patently an industry product.) Perhaps Miss Didion would dislike my writing just as much if I had praised her work. I hope so. But your readers might care to know about a possible tit for tat.Didion was typically cutting in reply. Had he reviewed her work positively, she insisted, she would still dislike his work, and “I would also have some doubts about my own.”
 


“Self-absorption is general, as is self-doubt,” she’d memorably begin that Woody Allen piece. Her complaints about Allen were pretty much the same ones she’d voiced eighteen years before about J. D. Salinger. Allen’s characters were “clever children,” who spoke in smart remarks that no serious adult could sustain as easily. They were obsessed with trivialities when they listed among their reasons to live Willie Mays and Louis Armstrong:This list of Woody Allen’s is the ultimate consumer report, and the extent to which it has been quoted approvingly suggests a new class in America, a sub world of people rigid with apprehension that they will die wearing the wrong sneaker, naming the wrong symphony, preferring Madame Bovary.She called out the one character in Manhattan who is in high school. That was Mariel Hemingway’s Tracy, a character drawn in what Didion terms “another adolescent fantasy.” She found Tracy too utterly perfect, and with no real family to hold her back from dating Allen’s forty-year-old neurotic. A man wrote in to object, at length, to the way Didion had disrespected what was obviously his favorite filmmaker. Her reply? “Oh, wow.” ●

270,"“I can’t say I’m unhappy about this extension, but it’s hardly enough for the millions of borrowers suffering.”","



 


When the COVID pandemic first struck, Johanna Daile, a third-year student studying history and psychology at John A. Logan College in Carterville, Illinois, knew they would have trouble concentrating in virtual classes. Having already accumulated $58,000 of debt over three years of college, they decided to temporarily quit school during the pandemic to focus on paying back their loans.But the pandemic continued — and got worse. Daile, then an assistant manager at Dairy Queen, relocated to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, to be near family in September 2020. They transferred to another Dairy Queen location, working the same position for less pay. The 24-year-old switched jobs a few more times before finding their current position at Kay Jewelers.Because they did not graduate, Daile wasn’t able to get their loans deferred, and going back to school isn’t possible without taking out even more loans. Their payments are up to $750 per month — over half of their paycheck. They want to resume their education, but the risk of taking on even more debt severely limits their options, Daile told BuzzFeed News. Now their goal is to return to school by 2025, if they are able.Student loan debt is an overwhelming burden shared by over 40 million Americans. It can follow people throughout their lives and lock them out of significant milestones like buying a home or, in Daile’s case, obtaining a degree. Advertisement     Under the CARES Act, student loan repayments were paused, and the federal student loan interest rates were set at 0% as of March 2020. In August this year, a month before the pause was set to expire, President Joe Biden pushed the deadline to resume payments to Jan. 31, 2022.As COVID cases surged this past month, the president on Wednesday announced that he would extend the pause to May 1, 2022. But Biden — who promised on the campaign trail to forgive $10,000 in student loan debt per borrower — has not indicated that he will cancel student debt outright, as progressive lawmakers have demanded, a move that would provide immense financial relief to millions of Americans.In his announcement of the extension, Biden acknowledged the difficulties that over 40 million borrowers have faced during the pandemic.“Now, while our jobs recovery is one of the strongest ever — with nearly 6 million jobs added this year, the fewest Americans filing for unemployment in more than 50 years, and overall unemployment at 4.2 percent — we know that millions of student loan borrowers are still coping with the impacts of the pandemic and need some more time before resuming payments,” Biden said in his Dec. 22 statement.Biden also promised that the Department of Education would offer support programs in the meantime and to help borrowers make payments come May 2022. But many borrowers told BuzzFeed News the extension doesn’t remotely solve the dire financial issue of $1.7 trillion owed in US student loan debt (including federal and nonfederal loans).“I just wish that it could help those who cannot afford to finish their education and those with private student loans because it was their only choice,” Daile said. “Adults in [the] upper-middle class and upper class can survive, but lower-middle class to low class, we are barely surviving with our payments.”
 


Student loan debt is just not a problem for millennials, according to Alan Collinge, founder of StudentLoanJustice.org, a group that advocates for total cancellation. More than half of all borrowers are over 35 years old, according to Department of Education data from 2020. Older people owe more than younger people, even though they may have borrowed less money initially years ago, Collinge said in the group’s response to Biden’s extension this week.BuzzFeed News reached out to members of the “Student Loan Justice” Facebook group, where borrowers share their stories and support one another. Many of them reacted to Biden administration’s recent extension with deeply personal stories.Kristina Allen, 52, lives near San Francisco and has one more online class to earn a bachelor’s degree in nursing from Regis University. She initially took loans out when she began studying to become a registered nurse as her twin daughters attended college. She graduated in 2008.
 


“I was a single mom in poverty, and I desperately wanted my twins and their little sister to have a better life,” Allen said, adding that her three daughters are all college graduates now. “My granddaughter doesn't know what hungry is, so the cycle of poverty stopped.”Over the years, Allen has paid off $90,000 in loans but still owes about $75,000; her initial loan was less than half that amount. Between 2015 and 2016, around her third year of the bachelor’s program at Regis, Allen defaulted on her federal loans and was charged exorbitant interest and fees. She‘s also subjected to a wage garnishment, which means a percentage of her disposable income is being withheld until her loan is paid off or considered not in default. One-quarter of her pretax income has been garnished since 2017 until the first pause in loan repayment came during the Trump administration, she said.Biden’s announcement of a loan repayment extension came as a relief. But once payments restart in the spring, Allen believes she’ll have to “drop her dream” of a master’s degree to focus paying off her loans with the wage garnishment.“Retirement? A home of our own? Not even a thought,” Allen, who said she has lupus and a related blood clot disorder, told BuzzFeed News. The repayment pause has given her a much-needed financial break to afford care for her husband, who has end-stage cancer, as well as address her own health issues she’s neglected. But, Allen said, she can’t afford to move closer to family and friends in New England; she needs her current work-provided health insurance to pay for her husband’s chemotherapy, support herself, and pay the loans.“I'd like to work less and take care of my own health, but I can't, because of my loans,” Allen said.Like Allen, Michael Goolsby, a 56-year-old who works at a Walmart in Fernley, Nevada, said Biden’s new deadline will postpone his wage garnishment; he told BuzzFeed News that, since 2019, 15% of his paycheck has been withheld to pay off his loans. Goolsby has a bachelor’s and master’s in history from Colorado State University; when he finished his master’s in 1991, he had $25,000 in student loan debt.The following year, he was told he faced a default. As a result, his school would not release his transcripts to potential employers, he said. He accepted an offer in early 1994 to consolidate his debt under a Sallie Mae program, which required him to take out a $36,000 loan. But multiple payment deferments and defaults only compounded his debt, causing him to fall behind no matter how much he worked, he said, ultimately leading to a wage garnishment. He said he’s trying to keep other debts down so he can eventually declare bankruptcy.His student loan debt now stands at more than $100,000, he said.“I did many things over time for a job, from driving a truck, managing a fast-food restaurant, working on an assembly line, being a paralegal for a San Francisco law firm for six years, working in IT doing technical support for 15 years, and then driving a cab and leaving California for Reno, Nevada, because that's where the jobs are nowadays as I work towards retirement, which may not even be on my 65th birthday in 2030,” Goolsby said. “But here I am.”
 


Justin Schanck, 43, a teacher in Macon, Georgia, said he owes $80,000 in loans from his combined graduate and undergraduate degrees.“I went to grad school to try and better my life and increase my income, only to add on more loans,” he told BuzzFeed News. Schanck said he blames himself for not thinking about the cost of a graduate degree, “but this predatory lending system certainly did not help.”Not using his hard-earned money to pay off his loans during the pandemic has allowed his family to “reinvest” in his community, he said. They put a new roof on their house to stop a ceiling leak and have been determined to shop from local businesses.“Once the payments start again, that money will essentially be taken away from the local economy,” Schanck said.Yirzely Villanueva, 27, of Canyon Country, California, said she feels both “relieved and stressed'' by the extension. She told BuzzFeed News she has over $40,000 in debt from a master’s degree in teaching from the University of Southern California. She said she’s happy that interest is paused for now and she can pay back “exactly” what she borrowed.“My loan is 60% of my savings and so I'm stuck,” she said. “I either pay off my loan and stay broke, or wait and be in debt indefinitely.”As a Mexican American woman, Villanueva said she feels like the “deck is already stacked” against her when it comes to taking out loans for a home or a car. “With my luck, I'm scared once I hit ‘pay’ [my student loans] will be canceled.”She said the extension makes her wonder why borrowers aren’t being allowed to just pay back their loans without interest.“I feel like I'm just stuck in a horror movie waiting for the ‘interest monster’ to get me,” she said.
 


Like others, Lyndsey Summers, a 31-year-old in Portland, Oregon, said the extension is not enough. “I can’t say I’m unhappy about this extension, but it’s hardly enough for the millions of borrowers suffering,” Summers told BuzzFeed News.She said she owes nearly $75,000 from her bachelor’s degree in communication media from Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania. She’s had trouble qualifying for public loan forgiveness and said she “struggles to get by” given her loans and her salary as a journalist. She said it’s been difficult trying to talk to the government and her loan servicer, with long hold times on the phone.“It is the servicer who works with borrowers, and when you ask them for specific information, they point to the school,” Summers said. “The schools don’t have to keep records, by the way, for longer than 5 years — at least according to my institution. I wanted to see an itemized receipt for how my loans were applied to my education. I have no idea if I’ll get an answer. It would have been nice to be notified that records would be destroyed.”Although state schools are “supposed to be more affordable,” Summers pointed out, it wasn’t for her. “I just want to be able to buy a home and get ahead.”Amy (who asked that BuzzFeed News only use her first name for privacy), 55, is a former teacher in Louisiana. She said she originally borrowed $46,000 when she started her undergraduate degree in 1997; after “faithfully” paying off the loans for nearly two decades, she still owes $30,800.
 


“I owe almost as much now as I borrowed, even after 20 years of payments!” Amy told BuzzFeed News. “I have resigned to the fact that I will never in my lifetime be able to pay them off. I will take them to my grave.”Amy said she has applied for teacher forgiveness programs in the past but has always been denied. “I really thought President Biden would follow through with his promises to help Americans such as myself that have been taken advantage of by a predatory loan system,” she said. “It looks like I was wrong.”

271,"Harry Reid, the former Senate Majority Leader and five-term senator from Nevada, has died at 82.","


WASHINGTON — Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader and five-term senator from Nevada, died Tuesday. He was 82.His wife, Landra Reid, said he died surrounded by family following four years of treatment for pancreatic cancer. Reid underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer in May 2018 and had said in 2020 that he was in “complete remission” after experimental treatments. Advertisement  “We are so proud of the legacy he leaves behind both on the national stage and his beloved Nevada,” she said in a statement.His death was immediately heralded by his longtime Senate colleagues.“He’s gone but will walk by the sides of many of us in the Senate every day,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted. Advertisement  Reid, who grew up poor in the tiny mining town of Searchlight, Nevada, worked his way up to the top Democrat in the Senate. A chess master of Senate procedure and political kingmaker in Nevada, Reid retired from Congress in January 2017, but he continued to be involved in politics. In the 2018 midterm elections, Reid hand-selected Democratic candidates for Senate and governor — now-senator Jacky Rosen and current governor Steve Sisolak.With more than 30 years in Congress, Reid has been synonymous with Nevada politics for decades. The international airport in Las Vegas was officially renamed after him just this month.Reid was first elected to the US House in 1983, serving two terms before running for Senate in 1986. Over the next three decades, he rose through the ranks of Democratic leadership, eventually becoming the party’s top leader in the chamber in 2005.For just over a decade, he and Mitch McConnell traded off the titles of majority leader and minority leader as their parties took control of the Senate. The two men had a contentious relationship that was built not solely on antagonism, but also on a grudging respect. They considered each other friends, despite years of bitter legislative battles.As McConnell noted when Reid retired, the two senators had a lot in common, despite their strong political differences, including having similar ambitions growing up. “I wanted to throw fastballs for the Dodgers. Harry wanted to play center field at Fenway. We wound up as managers of two unruly franchises instead,” he joked. Advertisement  
 


Reid compared their relationship to two lawyers — which both were prior to entering Congress — arguing opposite sides of a case. “I want everyone here to know that Mitch McConnell is my friend. ... So everybody go ahead and make up all the stories you want about how we hate each other. Go ahead. But we don't,” he said.Senate AccomplishmentsReid served for 12 years as Democratic leader, one of the longest-serving party leaders in history. In that time, Reid oversaw many deals and failures. Among his personal highlights, he noted his work on suicide prevention, inspired by his own father’s suicide; his push to pass the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to overturn recent executive branch regulations (McConnell later used this to rescind several late–Obama administration actions); and his fight to combat female genital mutilation (though he noted on FGM, “There's a lot more that needs to be done. Our government has done almost nothing.”).But Reid’s biggest legislative victory was passing the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Not only was the law the largest overhaul of the US healthcare system since Medicare and Medicaid, it took a lot of legislative maneuvering to get through Congress, much of it led by Reid and his House counterpart, Nancy Pelosi — particularly after Sen. Ted Kennedy died and was replaced in the middle of the process by Republican Sen. Scott Brown, killing Democrats’ filibuster-proof majority. Advertisement  Reid often spoke of Obamacare as a major legislative achievement, but also a personal one. “It would have been wonderful if we had something like that around to help my family when we were growing up,” he said as he retired in 2017, also noting that his father’s depression played a role in his push for better healthcare.Reid was close with Obama as well and took credit in a CNN interview as the first to suggest to the then–Illinois senator that he should run for president. “I called him into my office and told him he should take a look at it. He was stunned because I was first to suggest it to him,"" Reid told the network. “When he was reelected I got a call saying, ‘As soon as he gets off the stand, he wants to talk to you.’ One of most moving phone calls ever received, he said, ‘You're the reason I'm here.’”""I care about Obama. He changed the world,"" he added.In his farewell address, Reid said that working with the Obama administration as majority leader was a “dream job.”On Tuesday, the former president shared a letter he had written Reid before his death.“You were a great leader in the Senate, and early on you were more generous to me than I had any right to expect,” Obama wrote. “I wouldn't have been president had it not been for your encouragement and support, and I wouldn't have got most of what I got done without your skill and determination.” Advertisement  
 


Yet perhaps Reid’s most lasting effect on the Senate itself was his decision to invoke the “nuclear option” in November 2013, allowing the Senate to move administration officials and judges forward with a simple majority rather than 60 votes needed at the time for cloture. At the time, Reid argued that lowering the number of votes needed to confirm federal judges and nominations to the executive was necessary to end constant Republican filibusters. (He later told CNN, however, that he was inspired in part by New York Sen. Chuck Schumer telling him that Republicans were mocking him, saying he’d never go through with it.) The gambit worked in some ways; after dropping that bomb in the Senate, Reid pushed Obama’s nominees for lifetime judgeships, leaving the president with 334 successful nominations, roughly as many as former president George W. Bush had gotten through during his presidency.But the nuclear option had its drawbacks as well, and there were critics of Reid’s decision in both parties even at the time. McConnell used that rule change to confirm even controversial members of former president Donald Trump’s cabinet and to jam through lower court judges. And in 2017, as many predicted, McConnell went nuclear himself — lowering the number of votes needed for Supreme Court nominees as well, which allowed Republicans to confirm Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett to the high court. Advertisement  While Reid’s decision to go nuclear laid the groundwork for McConnell’s expansion, some liberals argued Reid was wrong not to expand the rule change to the Supreme Court himself when Republicans refused to confirm Merrick Garland, who Obama had nominated in 2016. On the other side of the argument were Democrats like Schumer, who opposed going nuclear for executive branch nominees and came to regret the rule change after it was applied to Trump’s cabinet.Reid defended the decision, even after Trump was elected, writing in a December 2016 New York Times op-ed that “the rule change has been a victory for those who want to see a functioning, open and transparent Senate.”“I doubt any of us envisioned Donald J. Trump’s becoming the first president to take office under the new rules. But what was fair for President Obama is fair for President Trump,” he wrote.Reid announced in 2016 he would retire, handing the reins over to his longtime mentee, Schumer. Reid told the New York Times at the time, “I want to be able to go out at the top of my game. I don’t want to be a 42-year-old trying to become a designated hitter.” Advertisement  
 


Controversy and Fighting With RepublicansThough he was soft-spoken, Reid could be brash and tough, showing flashes of what drove him as an amateur boxer in his youth during political bouts. He was a constant antagonist of the Republican Party, often skirting the truth to attack the right. Famously, in the 2012 presidential race, Reid claimed in a speech on the Senate floor that Mitt Romney, who released only two years of tax returns, hadn’t paid any taxes in a decade.That was a lie. And even years later, Reid wasn’t sorry about it. When asked if he regretted making the accusation, Reid told CNN in 2016, “Well, Romney didn’t win, did he?” Advertisement  Republican megadonors the Koch brothers were one of Reid’s favorite targets and most hated enemies. He devoted lengthy speeches to the brothers, calling their dark money investments in politics bad for the country and he relished using the line “Republicans are addicted to Koch.” Friends said his fixation on the Kochs was political — he’d later argue no one on the Democratic side was doing enough to counter the Kochs, so he just did it himself — but also personal; he felt very deeply that the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision loosening restrictions on money in politics was doing damage to the country and the Kochs were the biggest symbols of that.But Reid wasn’t as harsh toward Sheldon Adelson, another Republican megadonor who just happened to hail from Nevada. Reid once argued to MSNBC that Adelson, unlike the Kochs, wasn’t “in this for money.” “He’s in it because he has certain ideological views,” he added. “His social views are in keeping with the Democrats on choice, on all kinds of things. So, Sheldon Adelson, don’t pick on him — he’s not in it to make money.”
 


Early LifeBefore entering Congress, Reid’s life was straight out of a movie script. (He even inspired a scene in the movie Casino, which lifts some of Reid’s own lines.) He was born in Searchlight, a tiny town in the desert, and grew up in a house with no indoor plumbing. His father was a miner and his mother was a washer who cleaned clothes for the local casinos and the 13 brothels operating in the town of 250 people at the time, he often recalled.As he grew older, Reid became an amateur boxer and, as he acknowledged later in life, got into plenty of fights outside of the ring as well. In 2018, he was inducted into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame both for his own fighting career and for his advocacy for the sport while in the Senate.
 


He graduated college from Utah State University and later got his law degree from George Washington University. While in law school, Reid earned money by serving as a Capitol police officer, guarding the building he would later preside over.Reid’s father killed himself in 1972, a death that informed a lot of his later policymaking. He cited his father’s suicide in his push for increased funding to study depression as well as for suicide prevention efforts, but also in making his case for increased background checks for gun sales, as well as for the Affordable Care Act.In the late 1970s, Reid was appointed as the chair of the Nevada Gaming Commission, a powerful position where he oversaw the state’s casinos, which had a major mob influence at the time. In 1978, a Las Vegas man named Jack Gordon tried to bribe Reid to approve new gaming machines — an attempt that led to one of the more famous confrontations of Reid’s pre-political career. Reid reported the bribe to the FBI and worked with them on a sting to ensnare Gordon. Much to the surprise of FBI agents, when Reid met with Gordon, he grew increasingly angry and jumped across a table to choke the man, screaming, “You son of a bitch, you tried to bribe me!” before agents pulled him off and arrested Gordon.Three years later, Reid’s wife, Landra, found a car bomb attached to the gas tank of the family’s station wagon. Reid, who wrote about the incident in his autobiography The Good Fight, believed that Gordon was responsible. Gordon had spent six months in prison after the FBI sting Reid arranged but was never officially connected to the car bomb. It’s still unclear who was responsible. Advertisement     In 2015, Reid’s colorful past came back to haunt him in a bizarre conspiracy theory. The Senate Majority Leader had fallen after an exercise band snapped and threw him backward, causing him to break several ribs and injuring his face. He nearly went blind in his right eye and returned to Capitol Hill with a massive bandage over it that he later swapped out for dark sunglasses as he recovered. (Reid and his wife later sued the manufacturer of the exercise band.)But some conservative blogs and right-wing pundits didn’t buy the exercise band story and offered — without evidence — an alternative. One conservative blogger, citing a friend who had visited Las Vegas and asked around, suggested that Reid had been beaten up by the mob for not coming through on some kind of promise. Rush Limbaugh also said Reid looked like he’d been beaten up and said he didn’t believe the exercise band story. Breitbart went so far as to reconstruct Reid’s bathroom in detail from sales photos of the property in an attempt to disprove his story.Reid responded to the conspiracy theories in a CNBC interview, calling them ridiculous and largely blaming Limbaugh. “Why in the world would I come up with some story that I got hurt in my own bathroom with my wife standing there?” he asked. Advertisement     
 


Family LifeReid is survived by his wife, Landra, whom he met in high school and married at the age of 19. He has often described her as his first love and the love of his life. The two have five children and 19 grandchildren.In his tribute to Reid on the Senate floor in honor of his retirement, McConnell spoke at length about Reid’s relationship with his wife. “His idea of the perfect night out is still a quiet night in, with her,” McConnell said. “Landra’s his confidante, his high school sweetheart, his best friend. She’s his everything. And, for a guy who grew up with nothing, that’s something.”Landra had grown up Jewish (though she and Reid later converted to Mormonism), and her father opposed their marriage. At one point, Reid punched his future father-in-law in the face and Landra and Reid ended up eloping, though Reid said her family accepted them over time. Advertisement     In his own farewell speech on the Senate floor, Reid paid tribute to his wife, saying, “She has been the being of my existence, in my personal life and my public life. [Benjamin] Disraeli, the great prime minister, said in 1837: ‘The magic of first love is that it never ends.’ I believe that. She's my first love. It will never end.”Reid, in his speech, also shared the advice he had given to young people asking how to emulate his success. “I didn't make it in life because of my athletic prowess. I didn't make it because of my good looks. I didn't make it because I'm a genius. I made it because I worked hard, and I tell everyone whatever you want to try to do, make sure you're going to work as hard as you can at trying to do what you want to do. And I believe that's a lesson for everyone,” he said.“The little boy from Searchlight has been able to be part of a changing state of Nevada. I'm grateful I've been part of that change.” Advertisement

272,Hall of fame football coach turned broadcasting icon John Madden died unexpectedly on Tuesday. He was 85.,"


John Madden, the Hall of Fame football coach turned broadcasting icon, died unexpectedly on Tuesday, the NFL announced. He was 85.""On behalf of the entire NFL family, we extend our condolences to Virginia, Mike, Joe and their families,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. ""We all know him as the Hall of Fame coach of the Oakland Raiders and broadcaster who worked for every major network, but more than anything, he was a devoted husband, father and grandfather."" Advertisement     Though Madden was drafted to the Philadelphia Eagles after college, a knee injury prevented him from ever playing professionally. Instead, he pursued degrees in education and used those skills to embark on a successful coaching career.After stints in college football, he was hired by the Oakland Raiders as the linebackers coach in 1967. After two seasons, he became head coach; at just 32 years old, he was the youngest to hold that position in the American Football League.
 


Over 10 seasons, he led the Raiders to win 103 games in the regular season, with just 32 losses and seven ties. They won Super Bowl XI in 1977, part of a 17-game winning streak that was just shy of what was then the NFL record for consecutive wins.As remarkable as his coaching career was, Madden had perhaps even more of an impact in media. In 1979, he joined CBS as a color commentator and would go on to become the first sports broadcaster to work for all of the major networks.He appeared on radio, in ads, and even in a couple of movies. But his work in video games was revolutionary. The first Madden NFL game debuted in 1988 and spawned a bestselling cultural juggernaut estimated to have sold at least 250 million copies. When he was first approached, Madden thought the format might have potential as a coaching tool, ESPN reported, and his expertise became the foundation of gameplay that mimicked real football.After all, football is what Madden was about.""Football is what I am. I didn’t go into it to make a living or because I enjoyed it. There is much more to it than just enjoying it. I am totally consumed by football, totally involved,"" he once said. ""I’m not into gardening … or any other hobbies. I don’t fish or hunt. I’m in football.”

274,"The CDC’s updated isolation guidance took people by surprise, including some experts.","


On the quiet Monday after the Christmas weekend, the CDC took many people by surprise — experts included — by releasing updated guidance for how long people with COVID-19 should isolate themselves.The new guidance halves the number of days that people should self-isolate after testing positive from 10 to five, followed by an additional five days of wearing a mask when around others.Crucially, the shorter isolation period only applies to people who are asymptomatic, meaning they are not exhibiting any COVID symptoms, such as a cough, fever, or fatigue. People who are still feeling sick, especially with a fever, should continue to isolate themselves. Advertisement     Guidance also changed for people who have been exposed to someone with COVID. Now, in a signal that our understanding of “fully vaccinated” may be changing, only people who have had their booster shot can go without quarantining. A five-day quarantine, followed by another five days of mask use, is recommended following exposure for anyone else: people who are unvaccinated, who got an mRNA vaccine dose more than six months ago without a booster, or who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine more than two months ago without a booster.“I was not aware they were going to do that,” Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association (APHA), told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday. “But the essence of what they said is that as we get the science better, we have a better sense, even with Omicron, of what the exposure risks are.”Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, also welcomed the changes.“It’s been clear for some time that a one-size-fits-all period for isolation did not fit the period of contagiousness,” Adalja said. “The updated guidance reflects the fact that this is going to be an endemic virus and the disruption of a case can be safely minimized based on the enhanced scientific understanding that has accumulated.”The CDC stressed its new advice was “motivated by science” that demonstrates most transmission of the novel coronavirus occurs within the first few days before symptoms appear and then over the next two to three days.The recommendations “balance what we know about the spread of the virus and the protection provided by vaccination and booster doses,” agency director Rochelle Walensky said. “These updates ensure people can safely continue their daily lives.”
 


Speaking to CNN on Monday afternoon, Anthony Fauci, the top medical adviser to President Joe Biden, said the new guidance had been discussed for some time and called the changes “very prudent” at this current stage of the pandemic. Advertisement     Like Walensky, Fauci stressed that the recommendations would help the US continue to function as the country faces an unprecedented number of COVID cases in the weeks ahead due to the highly infectious Omicron variant.“With the sheer volume of new cases that we are having and that we expect to continue with Omicron, one of the things we want to be careful of is we don’t have so many people out,” Fauci said.“Obviously, if you have symptoms, you should not be out,” he added, “but if you are asymptomatic and you are infected, we want to get people back to the jobs, particularly those with essential jobs to keep our society running smoothly, so I think that was a very prudent and good choice on the part of the CDC.”The APHA’s Benjamin said these new changes were aimed at avoiding yet more harsh lockdowns. “Without this, we go back to the total closures, which nobody has the stomach for right now,” he said. “The politics for that just aren’t there.”The changes were announced four days after the CDC said asymptomatic medical workers could return to work after seven days if they test negative. That update was made out of concern that hospitals would be hamstrung by staff shortages as the Omicron variant spreads through medical facilities.But experts contacted by BuzzFeed News said they were confused why the same negative test requirement, even via a rapid antigen test, was not made for the general public to exit isolation.“I think finding ways to shorten isolation time is a great idea — 10 days is very disruptive — but with testing,” said virologist Angela Rasmussen, who called the CDC’s new changes “reckless.”“Seems the CDC is now just letting big corporations suggest policy and they are saying, ‘Let’s go with it,’” she added. “But it’s not the scientists at the CDC. It’s Walensky and her bosses in Washington who are dictating it, I think.”Epidemiologist Michael Mina also said that it was “reckless” to allow people to leave isolation without first testing negative, noting that he would not want to sit next to someone who tested positive five days ago. Advertisement     “I am 100% for getting people to drop isolation early,” Mina wrote on Twitter. “But it was always with a negative test. What the heck are we doing here?”Business leaders have been calling for changes to the isolation time for so-called breakthrough cases (vaccinated people who contract COVID) to minimize disruptions to the economy. Last week, before several thousand flights were canceled around the world partly due to sick crew members, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian asked Walensky to reduce the isolation time to five days for vaccinated people. He said the 10-day requirement “may significantly impact [the airline’s] workforce and operations.” But, according to Reuters, Bastian also said appropriate testing could play a role.When asked Tuesday why a negative test was not made part of the updated guidance, CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund again emphasized that most transmission occurs early in the first five days of a COVID infection. She said that for the purpose of a diagnosis, both PCR and rapid antigen tests were best used early in the course of illness. “Some people may remain positive by PCR test beyond the period of expected infectiousness,” Nordlund said. “The importance of a positive antigen test late in the course of illness is unclear and does not necessarily mean a person can easily spread the virus.”But experts contacted by BuzzFeed News said they suspected the lack of a testing requirement was due to more practical concerns: “You can’t get tested!” Benjamin said. “It would’ve been an interesting component of it, but you can’t get tests. People are lining up for hours to get tests.”“I don’t know who to blame, but what I can say is we need to focus a hell of a lot more on testing, and that’s something we as a nation have not done well in,” he added. “I don’t know what the holdup is.”
 


The Biden administration has said it plans to send half a billion rapid COVID tests to Americans to try to meet the new demand, but those may take weeks to arrive, offering little help to people currently in isolation who may be struggling to get their hands on one. Advertisement     Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, called the new guidelines “quite reasonable” but said that he too would have included a negative test as an exit requirement, as well as a recommendation for everyone to use better-quality masks, such as N95s.“Do I wish they had added testing, better mask guidance, etc?” he wrote on Twitter. “Yup. But still a step in the right direction.”Bob Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told BuzzFeed News that his preference would have been for the new guidance to only apply to vaccinated people and that negative tests be required on days four and five of the isolation period. But, he said, that could only exist “in a perfect world.”“In the real world, shorting the isolation time is critical if we’re going to keep hospitals, airlines, and other essential services open, given the skyrocketing cases of Omicron,” Wachter said. “A testing requirement would have been impossible to operationalize given the shortage of tests, and a vaccine requirement would have been difficult to enforce.”He added, “I think that the net benefit to society of bringing people back to work on Day 6 — assuming they mask on Days 6-10, as they’re supposed to — will exceed a relatively small number of infections caused by this strategy, particularly since Omicron is proving to be significantly less severe than prior variants.”Scott Gottlieb, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner who now sits on the board of Pfizer, told the Washington Post that the updated CDC guidance marked a new point in the pandemic.“The new guidance reflects a growing reality that we’re going to have to learn to live with COVID as a persistent risk, and can’t let it shut down society,” Gottlieb said.Benjamin said that as the world enters the third year of the pandemic, officials need to meet the moment with clear, calming communications, especially about the extremely low risk COVID poses to people who have had all their recommended vaccines. Advertisement     “We need to come to a consensus — not just as a nation, but as a planet — as to what the new normal looks like,” he said, “and how we live as this matures to a more endemic version.”

275,"""We want justice for our angel. Our precious little angel, Valentina.""","


The family of a 14-year-old girl who was shot and killed by a stray bullet fired by a Los Angeles Police Department officer while she was in a dressing room said they want justice for their daughter. Advertisement     Valentina Orellana Peralta was killed while shopping with her mother at a North Hollywood Burlington Coat Factory on Thursday, the day before Christmas Eve, when a man armed with what appeared to be a bike lock began attacking customers. Chaos erupted in the store. Employees and witnesses called 911 to report the crime, but due to the panic and confusion inside the store, police arrived on the scene believing that the man was likely carrying a firearm, the LAPD said. When officers arrived, they shot and killed the man, identified by police as Daniel Elena Lopez, 24.However, one of the bullets that officers fired at Elena Lopez pierced the dressing room door where Valentina and her mother were sheltering in place. She died in her mom's arms.""We heard some screams and sat down and hugged and started crying,"" Valentina's mother, Soledad Peralta, said in a statement translated from Spanish to English during a press conference Tuesday. “Valentina went to lock the door to protect us. We started hugging each other tighter. We were praying. I was praying for her, and I believe she was praying for me.""Suddenly, Soledad said, something hit Valentina with a strong enough force to throw her and her daughter to the ground.""I saw white powder coming out of Valentina's body and she began to go through convulsions. Her body went limp. I tried to wake her up by shaking her,"" Soledad said. ""She died in my arms and there was nothing I could do. To see a son or daughter die in your arms is one of the greatest and most profound pains that any human being can imagine."" Advertisement     Soledad said that police did not respond to her screams for help until after her daughter was dead.""When the police finally came, they took me out of the dressing room and left my daughter laying there. I wanted them to help her, but they just left her laying there alone,"" she said.
 


Police Chief Michel R. Moore issued a statement addressing the shooting on Friday in which he promised an extensive investigation.“This chaotic incident resulting in the death of an innocent child is tragic and devastating for everyone involved,"" he said. ""I am profoundly sorry for the loss of this young girl’s life and I know there are no words that can relieve the unimaginable pain for the family.""Moore said the department will conduct a ""thorough, complete and transparent investigation into the circumstances that led up to this tragedy and provide the family and public with as much information as possible.""In addition to the LAPD's review, the California Department of Justice is conducting an independent investigation into the shooting.On Monday night, the LAPD released a 35-minute video of 911 call recordings and edited surveillance and body camera footage of the events leading up to the shooting and its aftermath.Although Valentina cannot be seen in the video, her mother's scream can be heard after the shooting stopped.
 


In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Valentina's aunt Carolina Peralta said that her niece and sister came to California from their home country of Chile approximately six months ago.She said that Valentina's sister was working in a local restaurant and they traveled to the US to visit her. The trip turned into a longer stay, she told the LA Times, and mother and daughter had begun the immigration process in order to live in the country permanently.""Valentina was a shy girl in Chile, but everything was turning out well for her in the US,"" Carolina Peralta said. ""She was catching up with English and being more outgoing. She was happy to be with her older sister.""""[Soledad] does not understand how this tragedy could have happened just when they had managed to reunite the family,"" she said.During Tuesday's press conference, lawyers for the family did not announce any legal proceedings but said that they were considering all possible options, including a possible civil lawsuit.""We want justice for our angel. Our precious little angel, Valentina,"" Soledad said.Ben Crump, one of the attorneys representing the family, said the family wanted people to know that Valentina was ""beautiful, intelligent, and had the whole world ahead of her.""He also read out loud a statement from her dad, Juan Pablo Orellana Larenas, who had traveled to Los Angeles from Chile. He said his daughter once described the US as ""the safest country in the world.""""It is like my whole heart has been ripped out of my body,"" the father's statement said. ""She had dreams, and tragically those dreams have been overshadowed by this nightmare that has prevented me from sleeping at night.""

277,"The climate crisis is here, the US is woefully unprepared, and people are already paying with their lives.","


No one is safe. That’s the disturbing lesson of 2021, a year when every corner of the US was pounded by deadly weather disasters.A wicked winter storm descended on the middle of the country in February, bringing subfreezing temperatures to the typically temperate Texas, knocking out power and freezing people to death in their homes. In late June, people and animals were literally cooked to death in the Pacific Northwest, where temperatures shot up so high they rivaled those of California’s Death Valley. An August rainstorm unleashed so much water in a single day that a small Tennessee town turned into a raging river, knocking homes, with people still in them, right off their foundations. A late-summer catastrophic hurricane, wielding strong winds and heavy rains, battered communities from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast. And, most recently, a string of rare December tornadoes whipped through communities nationwide, pulverizing anything in their way.
 


“It was a really bad year,” said Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. He added, “We said that last year, and the year before, and the year before that. We’ve had a whole lot of bad years in a row for extreme weather.”This year’s devastation wasn’t just the result of random extreme weather. It was the kind of extreme weather that’s playing out in a world that has already warmed 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) in the past century and a half, an irreversible result of people pumping carbon dioxide, methane, and other dangerous greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.“This climate change stuff is already here,” Wehner continued. “The impacts are here. The sooner we accept that fact, the sooner we can start adapting our society to deal with it.” Advertisement  It’s natural to wonder: Is it only climate change that is making every terrible disaster, well, so terrible and so deadly? The answer is not so straightforward. And, adding to the confusion, the US doesn’t accurately track climate and weather deaths.For example, it’s still not well understood whether climate change is making tornadoes more likely to form and more intense. There’s more research to suggest that climate change is mucking with polar vortex patterns and worsening winter storms, like the one that slammed into Texas this year. Even that is still an open area of scientific debate.But the summer of 2021 is a different story.Climate change undoubtedly made the Pacific Northwest heat wave more extreme and deadlier than it would have been in a cooler world. The science is also robust linking rising temperatures to increasingly rainier events across the US — such as the Tennessee floods and Hurricane Ida — a result of a warmer atmosphere being able to hold more water vapor.These record-setting disasters were not acting alone. They are coupled with government officials, at every level, being woefully unprepared. A lack of air-conditioning in the Pacific Northwest left people unable to cope with the unbearable heat. A combination of outdated flooding maps, overwhelmed sewers and drainage systems, and unprotected homes left people at risk of fast-moving water.This double whammy has killed people.Among the dead were children, parents, and grandparents. They were sick and they were healthy. Their skin colors were white, Black, and brown. They were homeless and they were in their homes. They were alone and they were with family and friends. They were sheltering in place and they were trying to flee. It’s impossible to pin any of these specific deaths to climate change, but they point toward a terrible trend: The climate crisis is already deadly. Here is a look at some of the stories of people who have died, and what their fates signal about the future. Advertisement  
 


In the days before scorching temperatures arrived in the Pacific Northwest in late June, the National Weather Service kept updating its forecasts with increasingly dire predictions about exactly how hot it could get.On Saturday, June 26, the Portland International Airport recorded 108 degrees, a new all-time high. Temperatures topped 100 degrees across Oregon and Washington that day. Advertisement  Sebastian Francisco Perez, a 38-year-old Guatemalan immigrant who had only arrived in the US earlier in the year, collapsed while working outside at Ernst Nursery & Farms in St. Paul, Oregon. He died that day. At the time, Oregon lacked rules designed to specifically protect outdoor workers from the brutal heat.Sunday was forecast to be hotter, and in many places it was: Seattle hit 104 degrees, Portland’s airport hit 112, and Salem hit 113. In Eugene, temperatures soared to a local record high of 111 degrees, forcing officials to postpone the US Olympic trials for track and field.After enduring two scorching days in their home in northeast Salem without air-conditioning, Vickie Jones recalled thinking Monday, June 28, would be “a little bit cooler.” That’s what the early forecasts had predicted.“It wasn’t. It was hotter yet,” Vickie told BuzzFeed News by phone. “We weren’t ready for that.”That afternoon, Salem reached an all-time record high temperature: a staggering 117 degrees. Earlier in the week, Salem was roughly 30 degrees cooler.Vickie was worrying about her husband of 44 years, Donald, who was napping upstairs in front of a fan. She sent her great-grandchildren to check on him.“You need to come up and see Grandpa right now,” one of the kids yelled. “Something’s wrong.”Vickie found her husband standing in front of the bed, slumped over and unconscious. “His skin was so hot, I could hardly touch him,” she told BuzzFeed News. “I think he got overheated, and it was too late for him to call out because his body started shutting down.” Donald died the next day at the hospital. Advertisement  “He was only 67,” Vickie said. “He wasn’t ill or anything like that. That’s what is hard to grasp.”Based on official reporting of deaths from the extreme heat that persisted for weeks after, this was among the nation’s deadliest heat waves in recent history. Oregon reported at least 96 deaths associated with the event. Washington state officials reported 119 deaths between June 26 and July 2, and an additional 38 heat-related deaths occurring through August.The official numbers don’t tell the full story. The heat wave’s true death toll is likely hundreds higher. According to an excess death analysis conducted by BuzzFeed News, it’s likely that roughly 670 people were killed by the heat in Washington and Oregon in the week ending July 3.Days after the heat wave was officially over, temperatures lingered above 90 degrees in Spokane, Washington. Mickey Hardin texted her ex-husband Charles “Chuck” Hardin, a former salesperson for Budweiser, wishing him a happy 4th of July. His reply was the last time she ever heard from him.
 


“The next-door neighbor saw the newspapers were piling up. The truck was in the driveway,” Mickey said. Charles was found on his kitchen floor, water bottle in hand. He had diabetes, meaning he was especially vulnerable to extreme heat. He didn’t have air-conditioning.“It was a sad, sad situation,” Mickey said. “He will truly be missed.”That same week, an international team of 27 scientists reported the results of a quick study deciphering how much climate change played a role in the record-shattering heat. They found the high temperatures were at least 150 times more likely because of the warming planet; without climate change, they concluded, the heat wave would have been “virtually impossible.”
 


“We haven’t really felt how much we have changed the climate already,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist who contributed to the study. This event showed “what it means when your extremes become so much more extreme.”When asked if climate change was to blame for the hundreds who had died during the heat wave, Otto responded: “We haven’t counted exactly how many of these people are the excess deaths because of climate change — but because climate change is playing such a big role, there are many.”Shawn Cosgrove thinks his brother’s death may be one of them. Randall Cosgrove was a certified electrician and carpenter who did odd jobs across the region, Shawn said. Randy, as his family called him, drove to the site of a new job in Wilsonville, planning to sleep in his truck overnight so he could start first thing in the morning.Instead, he died.“That’s probably the hottest it’s ever been in Oregon,” Shawn told BuzzFeed News. He blamed climate change for what happened.“I think it’s pretty obvious,” he said. “He went to sleep and just baked from the inside out.”
 


On Aug. 21, 2021, before dawn, it started to rain in central Tennessee. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency, its highest flood warning, around 9 a.m. A few hours later, the agency’s Nashville office tweeted: “This is a catastrophic flooding situation.” The small town of McEwen was hit by an astonishing 20.73 inches of rain that day, setting a new state record for 24-hour rainfall.Waverly is a town over — and downhill — from McEwen. At some point during the downpour, debris washed into Trace Creek, which runs between the two towns, and obstructed its flow. Then, suddenly, a trestle bridge along the creek, which had been acting as a sort of levee, catastrophically gave away, officials told BuzzFeed News. Although Waverly only got 8 inches of rainfall that Saturday, in a matter of minutes the town went from being wet to being overrun with a mix of rain and runoff water.Kim Kee was sitting on the couch drinking coffee with her husband, Mark, when he said, “Kim, there’s a noise.”Kim got up and immediately identified the source: Water was pouring into the kitchen. She yelled at her mother to wake up and get dressed. Minutes later, the water was at their waists. Then she got hit from behind by a piece of furniture. She recalled the final moments in her house: “The refrigerator was sparking and falling over, the back door and front door blew in, and I was floating downstream.” Advertisement  She floated several blocks before managing to grab on to a tree limb, holding on for about four hours before being rescued and taken to the hospital. “I was black and blue on every part of me,” she said. “On my right breast, my nipple was just hanging off.”
 


That night, while staying with relatives, Kim learned that her 79-year-old mother, who had also been washed away, was alive after holding on to a telephone pole and U-Haul truck hinge for hours. But her husband was still missing. Mark was a knife maker, a collector of rare Japanese blades, and Kim’s everything. “We had the marriage everyone would kill for,” she said. “We were best friends.”The very next morning, Kim got a call to come back to the hospital. “He’s fine,” she recalled thinking. Then she saw the body bag.Reflecting on what went wrong, Kim blamed local officials and a railroad company for not properly managing the waterways. She does not believe in climate change. “I don’t know what’s going to happen from here,” she said. “Do 20 deaths matter?”While in his car, Jeremiah Shawl saw water topping over the road ahead of him. He used to be a first responder and immediately put that training into action. He went home to pick up a boat and set out to find his mother, Robin Shawl, and mother-in-law, Donna Bradley, both of whom had disabilities and lived in adjacent apartments.“I pulled up to my mother and mother-in-law’s front doors with a boat,” he said, and he was “hollering in there to see if they were still in the apartments.”But neither woman was there, and it's still not entirely clear what happened to them. He spent days searching. Their bodies were eventually found a few miles apart from each other.When Shawl heard the news, he thought about his son and how devastating the deaths would be for him. “My mother was my little boy’s world,” he said. “He practically lived there.”What happened in Waverly, he said, was “not natural.” He blamed much of the destruction on poor management of local waterways. “All the creeks are dried up. They are not cleaned up and not properly taken care of.”But another probable factor is climate change, which scientists say is making this kind of deluge more likely.“Because we know a warmer atmosphere has the capacity for greater water vapor availability, there’s just more water vapor available to these storms, whether they are rainstorms, hurricanes, perhaps even blizzards,” said James Marshall Shepherd, the director of the University of Georgia’s Atmospheric Sciences Program. “And so because of that, we see intense rainfall rates.” Waverly flooded in 2010 and at least once in 2019. This most recent incident was the most damaging and deadliest by far.
 


Just a week later, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4 storm on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. The storm’s fierce winds knocked out power for the entire city of New Orleans, and its strong rains washed out roads and homes. As Ida moved over land, its wind speeds plummeted and it was downgraded to a tropical depression. Still, the heavy rain continued more than 1,000 miles across the US, setting records and killing people up and down the East Coast.“Three-plus inches of rainfall in an hour in New York City — that’s just unheard of,” Shepherd said. In an urban area like New York, all that rain is hitting impervious surfaces, from roads to sidewalks to parking lots, rather than seeping into soils, he explained, “and so you get rapidly rising waters in response.”For the first time ever, the National Weather Service issued flash flood emergency alerts in New York and northeast New Jersey. Advertisement  “The water is coming in right now,” Queens resident Choi Sledge told neighbors in a basement apartment over the phone on Sept. 1, according to an interview with the New York Times. The neighbors were unable to escape, though. Ang Lama, 50, his partner Mingma Sherpa, 48, and their 2-year-old son, Lobsang, all died in their home in Woodside, Queens. A total of 18 people died from the storm in New York, according to the state’s official tally. Many of them died in partially underground apartments that flooded.“It was just too much water,” Robert Echavarria, fire chief in New Jersey’s town of Millburn, told BuzzFeed News.Echavarria’s team rescued more than 100 people. No one died in Millburn, but other towns weren’t so lucky. In total, 33 people died from Ida in New Jersey, making it the state with the storm’s highest fatality count.Shakia Garrett, 33, tried to help her neighbors as the waters started to rise around the Oakwood Plaza apartment complex in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The act of heroism proved fatal. Shakia died, as well as her neighbors: Jose Torres, 74, Rosa Espinal, 72, and their son Jose Torres, 38.The apartments were close to the Elizabeth River, explained Salaam Ismial, a distant relative of Garrett’s and a local advocate helping the impacted families. “It was catastrophic,” Ismial said, adding that the apartment flooded with more than 8 feet of water within minutes. Advertisement     Garrett and the Torres family tried to seek safety by climbing on top of a desk in the Torres apartment, he explained, but the water came too fast and too high. “Shakia was actually the last person to go,” Ismial said. She was on the phone with a Torres family member during the event, he explained. Suddenly the line went eerily silent. Shakia was gone.Due to the widespread flood damage, the entire apartment complex, home to more than 600 people across hundreds of units, shuttered after the storm. Many of those families are still staying in hotels, motels, and shelters, Ismial said. “The government bureaucracy is failing to find permanent housing for these folks.”
 


The climate crisis will only get worse. So is 2022 destined to be just as destructive and deadly as 2021? It doesn’t have to be. Straightforward steps to increase preparation and shore up infrastructure could mitigate much of the damage. But political willpower, urgent action, and key investments are often sorely lacking. Advertisement     That’s starting to shift in the places where the high stakes of climate change have already been made painfully clear.For Oregon’s Multnomah County, which encompasses the city of Portland and was ground zero for more than half of the state’s heat-related deaths, local officials and scientists are determined to avoid so many deaths in future heat waves.Going into last summer, Vivek Shandas, a Portland State University professor who studies how cities can adapt to climate change, had spent more than a decade sounding the alarm about the growing risk of extreme heat in the region. But he never got much traction with local officials or community groups. This year’s heat wave changed everything.“I’ve somehow become the go-to heat researcher for the region,” Shandas told BuzzFeed News, who described being “underwater with requests” from members of the community and government in July and August to talk about heat risk.Jessica Guernsey, the Multnomah County public health administrator, is one of the people now thinking a lot more about heat. “It was really devastating to know that this is going to be a norm,” she told BuzzFeed News, “and that we’re not we’re not fully positioned to [immediately] take care of every person in our community.” Advertisement     Heat-related deaths are preventable, and the solutions are simple: ensuring people are hydrated and cool, ideally with air-conditioning. But since the region has historically never reached such high temperatures, many people didn’t have air-conditioning at home during the last heat wave. That was true for the Joneses, the Hardins, and even Guernsey.If people aren’t able or willing to get air-conditioning at home, local officials can provide freely available “cooling centers.” The challenge is getting people there.Guernsey and her colleagues did a detailed analysis of everyone who died from the heat in the county. The highest number of deaths were people who were living alone on higher floors of buildings with no air-conditioning.“One of the things that really stands out in the event is the isolation,” she said, explaining that so many people died alone. Going into next summer, property managers and owners will need to communicate this risk to their tenants who fit in this category, and local officials will need to reach out to tenants as well. Or, as Guernsey puts it, “doubling and tripling communication.”Likewise, both state and local officials in New Jersey told BuzzFeed News there’s now a greater awareness about climate change and flooding risks after Ida. Advertisement     “I think it did change the conversation a bit,” said Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s environmental protection commissioner. “What hit New Jersey was the remnants of a tropical depression. So basically a really bad thunderstorm destroyed communities and literally washed people away.”
 


This means: “It wasn’t the worst of what we are going to see,” he said. As part of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration, LaTourette said, he’s devising new policies and programs that protect people from repeat and worsening flooding. This includes bolstering stormwater drainage in current and existing developments to incentivizing people to move out of harm’s way.“You know what it takes?” he said. “It takes political courage.”This fall, LaTourette spoke to the residents of Millburn, along with other places, about the state’s Blue Acres program, which offers property buyouts following devastating disasters. But it’s unclear if anyone will apply.“It’s very tough for some of these homeowners,” said Jesse Moehlman, Millburn’s assistant business administrator. “They like the community. They like where they are sending kids to school. It’s weird and difficult to have a conversation around that. They want to live where they live.”Moehlman, like LaTourette, is haunted by the idea of an even worse storm.“In the neighboring Maplewood, there was a resident who died and was sucked into a manhole,” Moehlman said. “All I kept thinking was, as a community, this could have been much worse. More people could have lost their lives.”In contrast, it’s hard to see how the flooding in Waverly, Tennessee, could have been any worse.According to Chris Davis, sheriff of Humphreys County, who was born and raised in Waverly and helped respond to the disaster, some 600 homes were demolished, dozens and dozens of families have already moved away, and he expects it could take a decade for the region to fully recover.“This was a massive, tragic event, nothing like we’ve ever seen,” Davis said.After resisting for decades, Humphreys County finally signed up for the federal flood insurance program in September. This immediately made the county eligible for certain types of funding to help respond to the current disaster and prepare for a future one. This won’t change much in Waverly, though, which was already a part of the federal program. What could have a local impact, though, explained Waverly Mayor W.B. Frazier, is a new floodplain management study commissioned by the US Army Corps of Engineers. “As a result of that study, there’ll be some correction actions, plans, and projects to come out of that,” Frazier told BuzzFeed News.Davis blamed much of the damage from the disaster on a dangerous pileup of debris that blocked a bridge until the water catastrophically poured out elsewhere. “I honestly do not feel like climate change had anything to do with it,” he said, later adding: “This was an act of Mother Nature.”Frazier, a longtime Waverly resident, had a different diagnosis for what happened. “I am a firm believer that our climate is changing on us, and it looks to me, by these flooding events especially, that it's getting more severe.”And since the August floods, he added, “I think there are more believers.” ●

278,Here’s what you should know about rapid COVID tests and their accuracy.,"


If you’ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately, you may have found long lines, empty shelves, and a frustrating lack of availability in general.This is happening as Omicron is making up the majority of new cases in the country, now about 95% of cases in the US.President Joe Biden recently announced that the US government is buying 500 million at-home COVID tests for the nation.While increased test availability is a good thing, those government-supplied, at-home COVID tests may not be available to request until January and could take months to be distributed. And if you are able to get your hands on rapid COVID tests, a lot of questions remain. How reliable are they? When should you use them? Do they perform differently with Omicron? Advertisement     Here are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests.When should you use rapid COVID tests?Rapid COVID tests are, well, rapidly becoming a way of life in the US. After being absent in the US for much of the pandemic, they are more widely available — and often sold out — in pharmacies and grocery stores as well as online.The pro is that they give fast results — in about 15 minutes, allowing you to make quick changes in behavior if you get a positive result.The con is that they may not be as accurate very early in an infection compared with other tests, like a PCR, that can take a day or more to get results.“Rapid tests are one of the most powerful tools that have not really been utilized in a powerful way in this pandemic,” said longtime testing advocate Dr. Michael Mina, a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer of eMed, a digital platform that facilitates at-home testing. “The government is in a position now where it’s bringing these tests forward, and now is the time to start creating a strategy around how will they be most effectively used,” he said Tuesday at a press briefing.You can take a COVID test for any reason at all, but here are the times the FDA recommends you get tested, even if you have been vaccinated.If you have COVID symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, fever, and other respiratory virus symptomsHave been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed case of COVID for a total of at least 15 minutes. (If you are unvaccinated, get tested right away; if you are fully vaccinated, get tested within five to seven days after exposure, according to the CDC.)If you took part in high-risk activities, including any time you couldn’t socially distance as recommended, such as when traveling, in crowded indoor places, or attending large gatherings or mass eventsMany people who are asymptomatic are now getting screening tests for COVID at work, school, or before or after travel or events.Although vaccines, especially when combined with a booster, are likely to protect against hospitalizations and death due to the Omicron variant, “we know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who were vaccinated,” CDC chief Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing on Wednesday. “These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others.”Regardless of vaccination status, you should wear a mask in public indoor settings. Walensky encouraged people to take at-home COVID-19 tests before gathering indoors “to help protect you and your family and friends who may be at greater risk of COVID-19 or severe outcomes.”How many different at-home COVID tests are there?There are now (at least) 11 over-the-counter antigen tests, which are the rapid tests that you can buy, take yourself, and generally cost about $20 to $35 for two — if you can find them.An antigen test detects proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can be picked up with a nasal swab.Keep in mind that no test is perfect. Any given medical test is measured by its sensitivity, or how good it is at picking up actual cases and not generating false negatives, and specificity, how good it is at ruling out people who aren’t sick and not generating false positives.Here are some of the at-home antigen tests that have been approved via the FDA’s emergency-use authorization:BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self TestiHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid TestFlowflex COVID-19 Antigen Home TestBD Veritor At-Home COVID-19 TestCareStart COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test/On/Go COVID-19 Antigen SelfTestSCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-TestInteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid TestCelltrion DiaTrust COVID-19 Ag Home TestQuidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 TestEllume COVID-19 Home TestThere are also over-the-counter molecular tests that are similar to PCR and can detect the virus earlier than an antigen test, but they cost more, Mina said. They include Detect, Cue Health, and Lucira, which can be done at home, as well as other molecular tests that are done in doctor’s offices.“Rapid molecular tests are slightly more sensitive but they are a lot more expensive,” Mina said. There are also fewer of them available. “It’s a much more difficult technology to build than a rapid antigen test,” he said.Are rapid COVID tests accurate and reliable?In general, yes. But you should know that false negatives are more likely to occur early on with rapid tests than with laboratory tests, like PCR.And it’s important to note, a small new study suggests that you can spread the virus in those early days if you are getting a false negative on a rapid antigen test.The study, which is not yet peer reviewed, included test results from 30 people out of hundreds involved in workplace outbreaks in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in December 2021. The people were fully vaccinated, many with boosters.The research team, led by epidemiologist Blythe Adamson, compared nasal swab rapid antigen tests to saliva-based and nasal-swab-based PCR test results. They found that at least four people had transmitted the virus during the time they had a false negative on a rapid test.While it’s “alarming” that the rapid tests didn’t always detect a high viral load, the study is getting a lot of attention and manufacturers will be working to update their tests, Adamson told BuzzFeed News.“FDA is paying close attention and I think manufacturers are ready to try to adapt and be agile,” she said. “So I think it will move quickly.”False positives are much less common. However, the chances of a false positive can vary by brand, ranging from one in 150 tests to one in 5,000, said Mina.That said, if your rapid test gives a positive result, you should assume you probably have COVID and isolate until you follow up with another type of test, like PCR.Rapid tests are about 30% to 40% less sensitive than PCR tests, and they are more accurate in people with symptoms than without symptoms.In one study, a popular at-home rapid test had a sensitivity of about 35% in asymptomatic people and 64% in people with symptoms when compared with PCR, but was around 100% accurate when it came to people who tested positive for COVID, whether or not they had symptoms. In the study, there were only a handful of false positives, all in asymptomatic people — but 47% were false negatives compared with PCR.These are still good tests! It’s not fair to compare rapid tests you can do at home in 15 minutes to a lab-based result that might be more accurate but takes a day or more (often many more) to get a result, Mina said. You may just need to keep all that in mind when taking a rapid test and know that taking multiple rapid tests is part of the strategy.“The test is very good when it’s positive, but when negative may frequently give you a false negative result,” said Dr. Stanley Weiss, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey.If you get a negative result, follow up with additional rapid tests in a few days to see if it becomes positive, especially if you have reason to believe that you were exposed or infected. Wait at least 24 hours for your next test, according to the CDC, but retesting a few days later can help you feel comfortable that a negative result is a true negative.Mina recommends that if you start having symptoms, assume you have Omicron and self-isolate. Take your first rapid test 24 hours after symptoms start and test again two to three days later.When interpreting and making decisions based on a test result, it’s a good idea to take into account a person’s history of vaccination, mask use, exposures to others, and their general likelihood of actually being COVID positive, Weiss said.Can rapid tests detect the Omicron variant?Yes, that seems to be the case, although the FDA recently announced that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive to Omicron than the Delta variant.It makes sense that a variant might change the reliability of the tests used to detect the virus and the FDA is asking manufacturers to test their products to make sure they work against Omicron and future variants.The FDA has identified a few PCR-based tests that don’t and have recommended that labs don’t use them.If you do have COVID symptoms, can it now take longer for tests to show a positive result than at the beginning of the pandemic?Yes, according to Mina. That’s because early in the pandemic, humans had not been exposed to the virus previously and symptoms — which are a sign the immune system recognizes and is fighting the virus — started later in the timeline of infection.Now that millions of people have either had COVID, been vaccinated, or in some cases both, symptoms generally start sooner. (And it’s clear that you can get COVID two or more times.)“You're going to become symptomatic potentially within a day after exposure because your immune system kicks in so early,” Mina said. He also noted that’s why COVID symptoms have changed and now include congestion and runny nose. “That’s your immunity working,” he said.Is a lateral flow test the same thing as an antigen test?Not exactly. A lateral flow test is a specific type where you dip a piece of paper in a liquid and after a few minutes one line appears — a positive control to show the test is working — and another line appears if the test is positive.While all rapid antigen tests currently on the market for COVID are lateral flow tests, not all lateral flow tests are COVID tests. For example, pregnancy tests also work in this way but use urine rather than a nasal swab for testing.Can a rapid test protect you from getting sick?Not really. Rapid tests are more about protecting other people, not making sure you don’t get the virus. (That’s what vaccines, masks, and social distancing are all about.)However, when people get tested before going to work, a party, school, or traveling, it helps protect everyone. (Although it also helps you get treatment sooner, which is important because almost all effective treatments for COVID are more likely to work the sooner they are started.)Rapid testing is particularly good to help stop superspreaders of the virus, Mina said.“For somebody who’s really spewing out tons of virus and is very likely to infect a lot of people, then the tests are more likely 95% or 98% sensitive for those individuals,” he said.

279,Here are some of the best gadgets that you can spend that Christmas cash on,"


There were plenty of predictable new tech things in 2021, like the latest iPhones or laptops. These are some of the weird, fun, or just useful things we tried out and actually recommend — from e-bikes to a cheapo phone stand, guitar pedals, and even a ’70s-style role-playing game.These items were independently selected by staff and except where noted, they spent their own money on it. Just so you know, BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them. Oh, and FYI — prices are accurate and items in stock as of the time of publication. Advertisement  
 


AirPods Max — $549 at AppleLook, Apple’s AirPods Max are some expensive headphones — like months'-worth-of-groceries expensive (Apple loaned BuzzFeed a pair to review.) And let’s be honest, your current earbuds probably sound pretty great and have more daily use cases. But if you feel you need over-ear headphones, the AirPods Max are a really good choice. They pump out clear, gloriously rich sound with solid separation. I am no audiophile, so I’ll not belabor this with “omg a unique magnesium cone!” minutiae. What I will say is that these headphones adeptly handled everything I threw at them, from the most annoyingly quiet Sufjan Stevens to colon-rupturing Swedish math metal. And they nailed the low note on Beastie Boys’ “Shake Your Rump,” which is the bass metric all headphones should be judged on. Beyond this, they’re thoughtfully designed, though their precious little charging purse is a bit much. So, yeah, if you’re intent on purchasing some high-end headphones, you’re not going to go wrong with these. But also: Groceries are a fun thing to have. —John Paczkowski Advertisement  
 


Casper Glow Light — $116 at CasperIt’s a very nice ambient light. You spin it to make it brighter or dimmer, which is both fun and handy. I use it as a bedside light and also as mood lighting in the living room when I watch TV at night. Then I can shut everything off and go to the bathroom or back to bed using just this light, which makes me feel like I’m in an old-timey movie using a candlestick. Convenient and pleasant! —Shannon Keating Advertisement  
 


Apple AirTags for my TV remote and rubber remote case — AirTags: $29 for one or $99 for four at Apple. Case: $7.99 at Amazon.The remote is by far the worst part of the older-model Apple TVs. It’s somehow super slippery in your hand and so light it feels hard to control. It’s super thin and small, the perfect size for losing between couch cushions. The newest 4K Apple TVs come with an improved remote, which is sold separately for $59, but that’s way more than I want to spend.So instead I put one of these rubber covers on my current remote. It makes it grippy and easy to hold, and the bright color is easy to find, which was great until my toddler decided it is her most coveted toy. Finding the remote very quickly became a daily, sometimes hourly issue. Either my daughter had run off with it, or an adult had hidden it from her to prevent that from happening. Advertisement  So I AirTagged the remote. The case has a special slot to accommodate Apple’s little item-tracking device. The “Precision Finding” feature in the iPhone’s Find My app makes it easy to find lost things like TV remotes with a visual tracking feature that approximates how far away an item is. And the extra weight the AirTag adds to the remote feels nice in the hand. If you’re only ever going to track a TV remote, you might consider Tile’s cheaper tracking device, but if you’re an iPhone person prone to misplacing more than one item (I wanted one for my keychain as well as my husband’s keys and one to stick in our car for the times I forgot where I parked), then the AirTag four-pack makes a lot of sense (Apple loaned me AirTags for review, but I liked them enough I bought my own.) —Katie Notopoulos
 


Janome 2212 sewing machine — $199 at AmazonAt some point last winter, I developed an itch for making things with my hands. I dreamed of becoming a DIY person, and that dream wore out my credit card. I bought paint, canvases, 10 balls of yarn, knitting needles, embroidery hoops, a hot glue gun that’s still sitting in my drawer, unopened. And in my frenzy, I also got a sewing machine, a Janome 2212 that Google led me to believe was “an easy sewing machine for beginners.”To my great surprise, it was not easy. Sewing machines have too many knobs and too many labels, too many sections to thread your string through and around, and yet are so finicky that you have to wonder why we’ve gone to the moon but can’t make a simpler, more efficient machine for sewing. It’s a messy and frustrating hobby, and it will fill up your room with scrap fabric and half-finished projects. I’ve lost entire days using this thing. I’ve made dresses, I’ve altered sweaters, and I’ve watched hours of YouTube tutorials explaining what the hell a French seam is and how to sew a zipper on. You have to follow instructions and be patient, two qualities I don’t care for. None of the clothes I’ve made have ever come out well; there’s always a loose thread somewhere and wonky stitching. But it’s also, somehow, meditative, and when you’re out in a dress you made and someone asks where it’s from, you get to say, “Thanks, I made it. Just don’t look too closely.” —Clarissa-Jan Lim
 


RadRover 6 Plus electric bike — $1,999 at Rad Power BikesI can’t afford the RadRover 6 Plus electric bike, but I was lucky enough to try it (Rad Power Bikes loaned BuzzFeed a bike to review) and, yes, I liked it. Loved it, actually. And I say that as someone who has never quite understood the electric bike phenomenon. But after this bike took me to a favorite fishing hole at 22 mph and then off-roaded me up a poorly maintained trail right to the water without requiring really anything of me or my rickety knee, I get it. I am not a bike expert. My last bike was stolen, and the one before that was a trashed Huffy Thunder Road. But I found the RadRover to be pretty amazing, though it is quite heavy and built like a small motorcycle. Great ride, good battery life, and very easy to use — even for e-bike Luddites like me. —John Paczkowski
 


Plasma Coil guitar pedal — $350 from Third ManThough you undoubtedly know Jack White best for his guitar work in bands like the White Stripes and the Raconteurs, he's doing some equally amazing things with Third Man Records, an independent label and, most importantly for the purposes of this review, a purveyor of a guitar pedal called the Plasma Coil. This is an apt name for a pedal that distorts the notes you play on a guitar by expressing them as a electrical discharges *you can see* courtesy a xenon gas–filled tube. Designed by Gamechanger Audio, the Plasma Coil literally amplifies audio signals to 3,500 volts. It sounds as badass as it looks — like a 50-pound wasp nest. It’s pretty much lightning in a box and an absolute blast to play. And if you dig the Plasma Coil, it’s worth noting that a few of Third Man’s other pedals are equally impressive, including the Bumble Buzz, (a sick fuzz box) and the Triplegraph (a digital octave pedal with individual octave-up and octave-down channels that make your guitar sound like a noise in a science fiction movie). —John Paczkowski
 


The Fantasy Trip: Legacy Edition role-playing game — $119 at AmazonSince I was (a) locked down at home and (b) no longer commuting, I had extra hours and nostalgia for the role-playing game of my adolescence — a criminally simple and fun one called the Fantasy Trip. Popular for its single-player adventures back in the 1970s and perfect for the pandemic era, the game was revived two years ago by its original designer in a legacy edition. A throwback to the mayhem-flavored era of pen-and-paper games, the easy but elegant rules allow for intriguing match-ups against monsters represented by cardboard square game pieces that evoke the era when light beer was new. Anyone who’s bored stiff at the thought of learning the latest gaudy Dungeons & Dragons rules but wants to bump off a band of bugbears, or who’s middle-aged enough to try to entice (force) your kids to do so with easy-to-learn rules, might give it a shot. I managed after a few tries to get my band of paper bravoes through a death test dungeon after a few weekends of on-and-off playing, and it has been a solace on rainy weekends ever since. In a nice mixture of old and new, I now play it over Roll20.net with an old high school buddy now living in Germany. —Dan Vergano
 


Lamicall metal phone stand — $9.99 at AmazonIn 2021, this became an essential part of my workstation. It allows my phone to act as a second screen (technically a third screen, since I already use a laptop plus a monitor). I previously had a flat wood stand that held the phone in a way that completely covered its speakers and microphone, making it impossible for video calling. This metal style also allows you to charge while on the stand. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Anker Nebula Cosmos 4K projector — $699 at AmazonWho needs a TV when any flat surface in your home is a screen? Anker’s Cosmos projector is remarkably good at playing movies on bare white walls with a clarity of picture and sound that will satisfy most everyone but AV aficionados. With Dolby Digital Plus 360° theatrical audio and a sharp 1080p resolution, a 900 ANSI Lumen autofocus display that can be recalibrated almost instantly and sharpened with the press of a button, the Cosmos solidly and accurately plays everything from home movies on a bedroom wall to Aliens on a bedsheet in your backyard. It runs Google’s Android TV, so it supports Netflix, YouTube, and a host of other apps right out of the box (Anker loaned BuzzFeed a projector to review.)—John Paczkowski Advertisement  
 


LectroFan white noise machine — $45 at AmazonFour mammals live in my home, and we all need our beauty rest. The busy New York City block we live on poses challenges: barflies late at night, trash trucks first thing in the morning, and every other imaginable city noise in the hours between. That’s why we swear by white noise machines. My wife and I share one. My 18-month-old falls asleep to one. Even my dog, my sweet, neurotic Chihuahua-dachshund, has a white noise machine on top of his crate. He gets scared, OK? —Joe Bernstein Advertisement     
 


Facebook Portal Go — $199 at PortalYes, there’s an irony that despite everything that BuzzFeed News has reported about Facebook over the past few years, I am recommending a Facebook product. If you want to feel truly pure about not supporting Meta, Facebook’s new parent company, well, go ahead and delete your Instagram account. It probably makes more money off showing you ads than the company would off a hardware purchase. I’ll wait.The truth is, the Portal is a great video chatting device. The smart camera follows you around the room and can accommodate more than one face at a time. It’s great for connecting distant grandparents and small kids, particularly the rechargeable Portal Go, which can be carried from room to room. My kid loves taking Grandma out into the yard to show off his toys and adventures. Advertisement     When I first tested the Go (Facebook loaned BuzzFeed a Portal to review), my one big complaint was that there was no way to fully disable the “Watch Together” function during a call, which can be an issue if you want to control the videos your kids watch. Meta’s head of VR and Portal promised to fix this. So starting in December, you can block Watch Together completely during calls. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Vilo mesh Wi-Fi routers — $70 for three at AmazonYou may have heard of this “mesh Wi-Fi” thing from your friends who have bigger houses and more tech smarts than you. The Vilo is the mesh router for everyone else. The idea is that instead of one crappy router you stash under your bed, you evenly space three futuristic white bricks throughout your house. As you walk from room to room, you’ll always have a clear, strong Wi-Fi connection. Why would someone who lives in a small Brooklyn apartment need three Wi-Fi routers? The obvious answer is: Why the hell not? Vilos are about $70 for three and surprisingly attractive for a router. By comparison, a fancy mesh system from Google is $349. Wirecutter’s “budget pick” is still $130. I loathe spending money, but these guys just make sense. —Scott PhamOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News
"
280,These are the life hacks that we're *definitely* taking with us into 2022,"


Many days it seemed like just making it to the end of 2021 was the ultimate life hack. These are some of the tips that got the staff of BuzzFeed News through it. From the best place to buy jumpsuits (Old Navy, seriously), the Peloton coach that got us through it (Jess King), the sublime experience of keeping a dream journal, or just…. Piglets — we full-throatedly endorse these.Most of these life hacks are free, but just so you know, BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them.

Peloton coach Jess KingThree days into my Peloton trial and about 10 minutes into a ride that was clearly way too difficult for me, I was seconds away from giving up. And then, I swear to you, at the very moment I was going to step off the bike the instructor, Jess King, looked me dead in the eyes and said something like “Don’t you DARE. Don’t you dare give up. You can do it.” I don’t know why, because I am typically cynical about things like feeling the person in a workout video stream is speaking to me, specifically, but I listened and stayed on the bike. And I did do it. And six or so minutes later, when King told me to lean to the right if I was going to puke, I did that, too. That was more than 50 pounds ago. And while diet and mindfulness had a lot to do with me getting healthy, so did Jess King. Because she kept me biking, daily. How did she do that to an older guy in the worst shape of his life? Distraction. With the exuberance of a trick-or-treating kid in their best costume ever or the happiest person at a rave, King is fantastically, endlessly distracting — with or without the live DJ that sometimes accompanies her. She rides the bike like it’s a horse and her steady stream of direction is encouraging and surrealistically instructive. “Pretend you have gills in your armpits!” “Nipples over knees.” “Breathe through your back.” “Oops, I meant add 5.” “Here comes the shitshift!” And, yes, “Puke to the left.” She is the only coach who consistently makes me forget about my own discomfort long enough to keep exercising regularly. And to be clear, the discomfort is real, because King is a very good trainer — she’s just giddy and comfortably ridiculous enough to distract you from it. —John Paczkowski Advertisement  
 


Getting rid of your carAfter I moved to LA, I acquired a collection of business cards and notes that people left under my windshield wipers or in the driver’s window that basically said, “hey your car is a dump, let me buy it.” Then I moved to a neighborhood notorious for having the worst possible street parking in the city, and my problems escalated. My catalytic converter was stolen. Then I paid a lot to replace it and cover other repairs. Then, about a month later, it was stolen again. Then I paid a lot to replace it again and cover more repairs. Then I installed an anti-theft mechanism, surrendered, and handed the keys over to my dad and let him drive away with it. Advertisement  I bought my bike for $200 on Craigslist a decade ago and have probably spent five times that much on upkeep since then, which is still a fraction of how much it cost to own a car. I’d already relied on my bike for most trips, and the car had become redundant. I was only moving it once a week to repark and avoid tickets on street-sweeping days.I figured ridding myself of this turbulent beast would simplify my life. And it has. Now everything I own on this planet is inside my little shoebox apartment. I immediately stopped paying for gas, for parking, for tickets, for oil changes, for brakes and tires and catalytic converters, for Geico, for the AAA membership, for the little sticker on the corner of the license plate. But it’s also made getting groceries a drag. And getting anywhere takes a little longer when you’re on bike and public transit. And I’m rolling up to dates with helmet hair and drenched in sweat. And, without a trunk or backseat to store things, I’ve had to embrace being a Backpack-Wearing Adult.It’s complicated things, but it’s simplified things. I’m tethered to the city, but I’m liberated. —Emerson Malone
 


Telfar medium shopping bag — $202 on Telfar (sold out, but $150–200 on Poshmark)The Telfar medium shopping bag is perfect. Many people have extolled Telfar’s virtues and you don’t need me to go into it here, but what I did not know was that the medium bag is the perfect size. It somehow fits absolutely everything I need for all possible situations: my laptop, my water bottle, the old Glossier bag I throw my toothbrush and face wash into when I go to my boyfriend’s place, the giant copy of Dune I for some reason take everywhere with me lately, a bunch of old disposable masks I forgot about — you name it. The handles and straps mean it can be worn or carried in a bunch of different ways without killing my shoulders and/or neck, and it somehow goes with everything I wear. I’ve never really been a purse girl, but I’ve been converted. I haven’t touched my ratty old tote bags once since this baby was delivered. —Addy Baird
 


Getting full coverage car insurance — $XX/month (varies obviously) from HagertyI purchased a classic car in full almost two years ago while we were all stuck at home and public transportation was frowned upon. When I first got it, I was in a rush to get it onto the road and only insured it for liability. In the back of my mind, I knew I should probably get better coverage but kept putting it off. A few months ago, the East Coast got hit with the tail end of Hurricane Ida and experienced extreme flash flooding. My car was supposed to be safe at my mechanic’s, but it turned out that his shop was in an area susceptible to flooding. Long story short, all of his and his customers’ expensive classic cars were destroyed — except for mine. My car just so happened to be on the lift that evening. I took that as a sign to get full coverage because I don’t think I’ll get that lucky ever again. I sleep much better at night knowing I’m covered for its full value if something were to happen to it. —Derek Gardner
 


Homefield Apparel shirts — $32 at Homefield ApparelNot that anyone needs to wear college-themed apparel any more than we already do here in the US of A, but Homefield Apparel has a lot of great retro or retro-appearing logos on T-shirts for a variety of colleges (including, for example, the Naval Academy, North Carolina A&T, and Rice — it’s not just Alabama and Michigan, you know?). The T-shirts themselves are not the sturdiest I’ve ever owned and will run you more like $30 a pop, but they look great and are extremely soft, and frequently the first I reach for when going for a T-shirt. These also fall squarely in the “good gift for sibling” territory, if your sibling is looking for, say, George Washington dribbling a basketball in a ’90s style, or the LSU tiger dunking one. It’s also semi-interesting to compare different schools and get a good sense for which are needlessly tight with what kinds of uses of their branding they’ll allow. —Katherine Miller
 


Old Navy jumpsuits — $30–44 at Old NavyI’m not ashamed to admit that I’m the person that’s usually two to three years behind the curve. So, it wasn’t until this year that I discovered I absolutely adore jumpsuits. My gateway outfit was a hand-me-down from my mother: a neon pink jumpsuit, covered in light pink starfish, that she bought on a family trip to Hawaii in the early 1990s. Since then I’ve gone all in on the fad, most recently buying a couple of styles from Old Navy as a self birthday present: the smocked cami jumpsuit for women in a leopard print and Breathe On cross-front sleeveless jumpsuit for women in purple. (Note that the patterns available are constantly changing.) It’s not uncommon for me to wear both of these, perhaps more than once, in a week. They are soft, flattering, and, of course, have pockets, making them the go-to outfit for walking my daughter to daycare, sitting at home in front of my computer, or meeting work colleagues for drinks at an outside bar. —Zahra Hirji
 


Keeping a dream diary — $24 for BuzzFeed News’s notebook from AppointedMost of my dreams are innocuous and forgettable; these are the ones where I’m reading Slack and scrolling through Twitter, and it hurts my feelings that this is the best my nocturnal imagination can do. But sometimes there are the surreal stream-of-consciousness ones that mold my entire day. Not just the ones where my molars are falling out, but the ones where I’m skateboarding around the White House and running through an unbelievably beautiful meadow and babysitting a gross alien creature. That’s why I started keeping a running doc in my Notes app simply titled “weird dreams lately,” dedicated to the more twisted yarns, which are always a genuine delight to revisit.Chuck Klosterman wrote, “People who talk about their dreams are actually trying to tell you things about themselves they'd never admit in normal conversation. It’s a way for people to be honest without telling the truth.” So if that’s the case, what do I do with these:Nov. 26: Woodward and Bernstein are standing arm in arm on an elevated platform in a nightclub and singing something to the effect of “I ain’t never seen two pretty best friends / It’s always one of them gotta be ugly.”Dec. 11: An earthquake. The foundation of my condo’s building was tipping dramatically toward the street. I was holding onto a table for balance. The cats, Puck and Toby, were freaking out. Puck was standing on his hind legs trying to grab the air with both paws. All we could do was laugh.Dec. 21: I was performing in a play at my middle school at my current age. All the actors started to go off script. I got too comfortable and said the word “motherfucker” and everybody went silent and stared at me.Feb. 2: Someone kept using the phrase “that’s like putting braces on a scorpion.”Feb. 19: Dad and I visited a space museum run and operated by Mike Myers. We watched a video about efforts to extract petroleum on Mars and the voiceover sounded a lot like Dad. He wouldn’t admit that it was him. I asked Mike Myers who did the voiceover and he said it was Dad. —Emerson Malone
 


PigletsOut of all my attempts at mid-pandemic rejuvenation and despair mitigation, visiting a local farm with a bunch of piglets was by far the most effective. Piglets are a lot like puppies in that they are small, cuddly, and curious. But because they are pigs, they are arguably better. Their diminutive grunts and oinks? Their pristinely pink little noses and tiny ever-spinning tails? How ferociously, soothingly adorable. And how gently they pluck a piece of apple from your fingertips! It’s sort of the pig equivalent of a friend’s baby holding your finger. All this stuff makes a visit with piglets a killer pandemic poultice, an experience that will leave you giggling and obliterated for at least a few hours of the 18 months of the miasma of horror, idiocy, and anger we’ve all been living through. —John Paczkowski
 


Fabric face masks — $32 at BagguI struggled for so long to find a mask that not only fit my face but felt cute! These masks have a flap that covers your mouth, chin, and nose so they’re great for glasses wearers, too. I get so many compliments when I wear these! —Nicole Fallert
 


CheekfaceYou know those TV episodes where the plot can’t be resolved because one catastrophe leads to another? It feels like we’ve been stuck in one of those for half a decade, with the finale being isolation from friends and family for almost two years (The dumpster fire got bigger, now we need a bigger dumpster and a book of matches). But with the pandemic easing, I've been trying to get back to being human, and what's been helping me do that is the band Cheekface. (Here, let me explain how breathing works: You suck in and you continue to live).The LA-based trio of Greg Katz, Amanda Tannen, and Mark “Echo” Edwards specialize in tight, talk-sung indie tunes of wry hopelessness and hopeful wryness (It’s your best life if it’s the life that you’re living right now). With their two LPs (2019’s Therapy Island and 2021’s Emphatically No) and a smattering of singles, covers, and B-sides, they balance the boredom of living while the world burns and the joy of simply existing (Sometimes I wonder if there's a single good thing on earth. And then I eat Cinnamon Toast Crunch.). Advertisement     In early October, I was in a (masked, vaccinated) crowd indoors for the first time since the pandemic started, to catch Cheekface when they swung through NYC. It was a needed, personal reminder that crowds don’t have to be a threat. They can be a balm. (I liked it better when you were standing next to me.) —Brandon Hardin
 


Tarot cards — $17 at AmazonOne of the joys introduced to me this year was a new deck of tarot cards I received as a gift from a good friend. We sat on her sofa and each thought of something going on in our lives, drew a card, looked up its meaning, and thought intently about what it reflected about our personal state of affairs. We’ve all just quietly gone through so much in the pandemic. The answers, of course, lay in our interpretations, and the tarot cards can be a vehicle for self-reflection more than anything else. As we come out of a year spent in partial isolation, it was just more fun to do it with an old friend, laughing together and cheering on each other’s realizations made through a beautiful deck of divination cards. The answers we seek all lie in us anyhow, we just need some help getting to them, and a reminder that we’re not alone. —Venessa Wong Advertisement     
 


Used furniture from AuctionNinja.comAuctionNinja is an online estate sale auction site. It’s kind of like eBay, but with items grouped by individual estate sales, so typically a whole house’s worth of furniture and or other belongings. It’s a massive pain to buy stuff there, because you have to pick it up — in person — at a specific time window at the actual house over that weekend, or you forfeit payment! But because it’s such a pain, the prices…. My god, the prices.... They are just sublime. Advertisement     I moved this summer and needed some new furniture. My personal style has always been for vintage or thrift stuff, and with the supply chain issues happening I was hearing horror stories from friends waiting months for a West Elm couch to arrive. I paid under $1,000 for two matching couches in great condition from a fancy home in Greenwich, Connecticut (a friend helped load and move them). This is a site I almost hesitate to recommend because I don’t want too many people to find out about it and jack up the prices. It’s an amazing bridge between the random stuff on Facebook Marketplace/ Craigslist and a curated antique shop. —Katie NotopoulosOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News
"
281,“I've invested too much hope only to be burned. I'm not going to hold stock in the future anymore.”,"


As we head into yet another holiday season marked by the uncertainty and dread of an ongoing pandemic, I’ve been trying to count my blessings. None of my loved ones have died of COVID. I have a job, a cozy home, and my health (physical, if not mental 🥴). In the grand scheme of things, I am absurdly lucky.But I also can’t help but reflect upon everything we’ve missed out on these last two years. Most of what I’ve lost — what we have all lost — is time. Precious, precious time. For me, that’s meant time with my fiancé, who’s only just been able to get back into the US from her native England after a year and a half of travel bans. Other families across the country and around the world have been robbed of time with elderly relatives in the last months of their lives, or the first few months or years with loved ones’ newborns.Soon, we’ll all be a couple of years older than we were when this all began, but it doesn’t necessarily feel that way — in part because certain milestones and accomplishments we might have otherwise reached continue to evade us, and might still for years to come. Advertisement  I wondered how other people might be grappling with these kinds of losses, especially because they’re more amorphous than the chilling finality of death. The social scientist Pauline Boss calls those unclear and often unacknowledged absences in our lives “ambiguous loss”: the result of “an accumulation of heartbreaks that we cannot always recognize,” as Meg Bernhard put it in a December New York Times profile of the emeritus professor. Boss has recently broadened the scope of her work to “questions of societal bereavement” during this time of “atmospheric grief.”Rose Gulati, a 22-year-old living in Toronto, was one of over a hundred people to respond to a BuzzFeed News survey last month about coping with these ambiguous losses. The pandemic began when she was halfway through her third year in university. Now that Gulati is “single, out of school and studying nothing,” she said she feels “robbed” of the time she lost. “Time at university, time with my friends, time to grow into myself. My transition from vibrant, defiant student to stay-at-home adult happened so quickly that I didn’t have time to grieve what I had lost,” she said. “I don’t go to drag shows or protests anymore. I watch TV to amuse myself and stay up late just to feel like I have something to do. The pandemic took away everything that made life fun and worthwhile.”“In a lot of ways, I’m still 20,” Gulati continued. “In others, I’ve lived through the monotony of life and I’m dead.” Advertisement  Death was a recurrent and troubling theme across multiple respondents’ answers. “I feel like I lost two years of my life and now I’m closer to death!” said Juliana Bruno, a 50-something in southern California who works in academia.“I’ve become acutely aware of my mortality and how my time here is truly limited,” Gulati said. “I’ve tried to make peace with death. All of these things that are supposed to come up with life are coming up for me now, because I feel like I’ve lived my life and I’m done with it. The pandemic has turned life into a passive activity of waiting to die. I’m not really alive, I’m just waiting.”Now that the Omicron variant has plunged much of the world into yet another wave of ambiguity and doubt, Gulati is far from alone when it comes to the sense of living in a perpetual state of limbo.“I feel like it's hard to make plans at all now,” said Christina Marfice, 31, a marketing strategist in Chicago. “Everything feels tenuous all the time, like we're constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. I've found it's better for my mental health to make no plans at all than to try to plan things and have them be canceled or changed, so I've been living in this indefinite holding pattern since early 2020. It's like life is on pause right now with no indication of when it might start moving forward again.”“Quite honestly, I can't imagine what my life will be like next August, much less five or ten years from now,” said a 22-year-old student in Utah who asked that their name be withheld from this story for privacy. “I've invested too much hope only to be burned. I'm not going to hold stock in the future anymore.” Advertisement  
 


The pandemic has made it rudely clear that none of us are getting any younger.Many of my fellow millennials, as well as Gen Zers, feel like they’re losing or have already lost the best years of their youth — and the promises that those years were supposed to hold.“I feel like I’m on some sort of time limit to have fun, and that I’m failing to meet that goal before time runs out,” said Becca Lo Presti, a recent college grad living in Vermont who never imagined spending the glory years of her 20s in a pandemic. “I don’t have the time to be carefree or take adventures. I feel 42, not 22.”“I've moved home and turned 30 while living in my parents’ basement — something that I vowed would never happen,” said Allison Weiner, a marketing coordinator in Rochester, New York. “Now I'm stuck playing family game night instead of playing out my ever-dwindling youth.” Advertisement  “I lost out on so much of my young adulthood,” said Holly Seibold, 24, a fiber artist in Tempe, Arizona. “I thought I would be dating and partying while making friends and putting roots down as I figured out what I want to do long term. I’m currently not doing any of those things.”Dozens of respondents also cited dating and relationships as things they’ve missed out on these last two years.
 


“I feel like the pandemic really hindered my romantic life,” said Michelle Vizzi, a 30-year-old lawyer in New York City. “I broke up with my boyfriend in December 2019 and was just starting to date again when the pandemic hit. I dated a little during the pandemic but I just felt like I lost so much time. And then suddenly I was 30. And do you know what no one warned me about turning 30 as a straight woman? That suddenly the number of likes/matches/etc. you get drops significantly. So many guys have their parameters set to stop at 29. I feel like I lost my last 2 ‘good years’ and now I have so few choices. I always thought that by 30 I would be in a long-term committed relationship and now I'm lucky if I get a match on a dating app. It's really depressing.”“I am looking to settle down, find a life partner, buy a house and stop living with my parents,” said Rachel Lalli, 28, who builds homes in Hanover, Massachusetts. “I have little to no social life and have grown very distant from old college and high school friends. I am now left to wonder how and when I will find my person. Will the world be in a better place?”Dating is one of the first pandemic losses that comes to mind for that 22-year-old student in Utah, where coming out, they said, “is still a dangerous endeavor.” Their university doesn’t have on-campus housing. “I've been living in off-campus apartments approved for BYU-Mormon university, pioneer of electroshock conversion therapy, and home to recent homophobic remarks by church leaders about ‘musket fire’ against queer people,” they said. “I haven't gone on a single date since moving here. I expected by this point in my life to have had at least one serious relationship.”Delays in dating have also meant, for many people, delays in starting a family.“Before the pandemic, I had one friend who had a baby,” said Reaganne Hansford, a 25-year-old speechwriter in Washington, DC. “Now, I have at least 10 friends with babies they had during the pandemic. I don’t know if their timelines were accelerated by the pandemic, but as someone who was NOT ready to have kids 2 years ago (and still don’t feel ready) it has made having kids really heavy on my mind lately. I ask myself if I just don’t want to be left behind by everyone else, but it has made me reevaluate what I want out of the rest of my 20s.”Some people — myself included — are questioning whether to have children at all.“I’ve wanted nothing more than to be a mom my whole life,” Lalli said. “But should I be bringing more people into this messed up world? Is climate change going to end us? Is it going to get so bad as to the point where we are all fighting for our lives again? I know it’s hard to say, so I keep living for a better day.”
 


“I've stopped thinking about possibly having kids someday, because it feels so impossible as a female-identifying person to go through that with American healthcare and laws being how they are,” said Jessica Clair, a 28-year-old living in the DC area. “I also can't imagine bringing a kid into this shitshow — that just feels insanely unfair now.”“2020 was supposed to be the year that my husband and I would start our journey to becoming parents,” said Teresa Martinez, 33, who manages a medical office in southern California. “We had previously put those plans on hold due to familial obligations. His grandma got sick and passed in 2018. My father was diagnosed with cancer in late 2018. It took a toll on us to take on additional responsibilities with our families during this time [and] we made the decision to hold off on trying for a few years to focus on our families.”After getting vaccinated, “we considered trying again,” Martinez said, “but we have seen so much in the last 2 years that it made us really stop to think, do we want to subject a child to this world we live in? Broken healthcare system in the US, broken political system, a capitalistic society in which people of average incomes are unable to afford the cost of living, the rampant racism that exists in this world, etc. Is it responsible to bring a child into this world?”It isn’t only the potential for future families that people have given up on. Many who wrote in noted that they’ve given up relationships with current family members over the past two years because of fundamental disagreements about COVID safety.Rachel Friedrick, a 31-year-old writer in Traverse City, Michigan, had her first child, a daughter, in October 2020. “Aside from their initial visit when she was born, we didn’t see family for the first 6+ months of her life, until the family could get vaccinated,” she said. Some family members understood while the decision to keep loved ones away ruptured other relationships completely. “My husband is a pediatrician and saw Covid patients, so we lived in constant fear that he might bring Covid home to our daughter unknowingly. I struggled through an incredibly isolating maternity leave alone, without friends or family, and then returned to my remote work trying to figure out how to balance working with a baby that refused a bottle and wanted to be fed at the breast every 2 hours. The first 6 months of my daughter’s life were some of the most lonely, isolated, and difficult days of my husband and I’s life.“I feel such loss around the entire experience of becoming a parent,” Friedrick continued. “Memories like my baby’s first Christmas only bring up loneliness and pain, especially because of the family relationships that were broken.”“When you work in healthcare and are seeing people dying daily in the midst of a pandemic, it becomes difficult to maintain relationships with people who are spreading false narratives about the ‘plandemic,’” Martinez said. She lost multiple friends and family members due to COVID-19: some of them died of it, and others got swept up in misinformation. “Even when trying to explain the reality of the situation, people choose to not believe,” she said. “Rather than stress myself out trying to show reality, it was easier to just step away from these relationships and focus on my own mental and physical health.”
 


On the flipside, when the future seems uncertain, we can better appreciate how precious time really is. The pandemic has forced many of us to consider how we want to spend our remaining days — because they are limited, and because they are all we have.For many people, that has meant a radical reconsideration of their relationship with work.“My life is more than half over and I fucking wasted it on stupid beliefs that I had to give 110% to ‘the man,’” said Bruno, the 50-something in southern California. “I should have been doing all that for me — not stupid work that wouldn’t even send flowers if I died tomorrow.”“My professional life, which was for a long time the anchor of my twenties, feels pretty stupid and meaningless in the context of pandemic remote work,” said Taylor Broadfoot, 30, who works at a marijuana tech startup in Seattle.For Clair, the pandemic “really reaffirmed that I don't want work to be a core part of my identity,” she said. “I never had huge career aspirations but this has made it even more clear that working 60+ hours a week in a salary position is just not worth it.”“I lost my entire identity,” said Dani Steeves, a 33-year-old event manager in Ontario, Canada. “I didn't realize how intertwined I as a person had become with my job. I lost friends who I had worked with for a decade because at a time when I needed them the most, they were radio silent.” After that, “I am no longer a person who views their future solely in career terms. Now that I have seen I am an expendable asset to a company that I had devoted my life to, my future outlook no longer always involves the career I thought I would never leave.” Advertisement  Without the potential of a career, romance, or parenthood to give us a sense of identity and purpose, what’s left?“In some ways, the pandemic actually helped me become more sure of myself and make more definitive plans for the future,” said Sydney Spaulding, 23, a writer in San Diego. “When going out all the time wasn't an option anymore, it made me really look at myself in the mirror and try to get to know that person better. In a way, that was a positive change that came out of all this.”
 


Barry F. Keaveney, a 75-year-old semi-retired photographer in rural Arizona, is focusing on “finding satisfaction in home alone time: watching better movies, better cooking, updating computer knowledge.” He thinks we’re facing “a dark future with the Covid pandemic, polarized politics, QAnon and Trump haters and liars, real climate threats and a failed Congress to deal with these problems.” He’s coping with the ambiguous losses of the past couple years by “making up for lost time.” That means “going around with my new cameras, taking photos, considering getting back to drone videos but with more new and professional gear.”“I used to want to have everything figured out, but now I am more happy in the moment,” said Maria Natola, a 32-year-old high school teacher in Vancouver. “I know what I need to be content and to feel like I am living a full life, and many of the things I thought I ‘needed’ have turned out to be nice extras that don't make or break my life. It's cliche, but I've learned that it truly is the little things, and if the little things don't make you happy, neither will the ‘big’ things.”“I think I lost my tolerance for bullshit during the pandemic,” said Jeane Emily DuBose, a 26-year-old who works in medical research in Chicago. “I kind of decided that I'm not going to be afraid of things anymore. I decided to start writing the book I'd been thinking about for years but never actually put to paper. I quit grad school. I quit my job and found a better one I'm excited about. I started making dumb TikToks about vintage romance novels because it's something I enjoy. I've spent so much time being afraid and I decided that I don't care anymore.”“I need to make full use of my pause to really do what I want to do next year,” said Gulati, the 22-year-old Canadian who’s been reflecting a lot on her mortality. “I have to sit down with myself and figure out what that even is. I can’t be afraid of the future, as tiresome as it is to live it. The future is happening right now, and I want to make the most of it. I don’t want to let the past two years dictate the rest of my life. I tried to ‘live’ this summer — I slept with more men than deserved it and got too many piercings. I want to rediscover what meaning actually means to me and I want to live it. For real, this time.” ●

282,"The CDC has cut isolation time for people with COVID from 10 days to 5, then 5 days of wearing a mask, regardless of vax status.","


The CDC is shortening the length of isolation time recommended for people with COVID-19, cutting it from 10 days to five, the organization announced Monday.If a person is asymptomatic at the end of the five days, they may end their isolation. The new recommendations also say they should continue to wear a mask for another five days when around other people. Advertisement     ""The change is motivated by science demonstrating that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs early in the course of illness, generally in the 1-2 days prior to onset of symptoms and the 2-3 days after,"" the CDC explained in a statement.The guidance around quarantining after exposure is also changing. Previously, the CDC said fully vaccinated people did not have to quarantine if exposed to COVID-19. But in their Monday announcement, the organization said that would now only apply to people who have received their booster shot.A five-day quarantine, followed by another five days of mask use, is now recommended following exposure to the virus for anyone who is unvaccinated, more than six months out from their last vaccine dose, or more than two months out from getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine without a booster.If the exposed person is unable to quarantine, it is recommended they wear a mask for 10 days when in the presence of others.But even people who have gotten their booster shot should still exercise caution following exposure to the virus. Though they don’t have to quarantine, the CDC said they should still wear a mask for 10 days following the exposure. Advertisement     Regardless of vaccine status, the CDC recommends people get tested for COVID-19 five days after being exposed.The new recommendations come as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has become the dominant strain in the US.“The Omicron variant is spreading quickly and has the potential to impact all facets of our society,"" Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC's director, said in a statement on Monday. ""CDC’s updated recommendations for isolation and quarantine balance what we know about the spread of the virus and the protection provided by vaccination and booster doses.""Walensky said the updated guidance should ""ensure people can safely continue their daily lives.""""Prevention is our best option,"" she said. ""Get vaccinated, get boosted, wear a mask in public indoor settings in areas of substantial and high community transmission, and take a test before you gather.”

283,"He put nature conservation on a scientific footing, battled colleagues who were enraged by his biological explanations of human behavior, and won two Pulitzer prizes — all inspired by ants.","


If any modern scientist can claim to have carried the torch lit by Charles Darwin, it was Edward Osborne Wilson — usually known as ""E.O.""Wilson pioneered the study of biological diversity, adding a theoretical dimension to nature conservation — which had previously seemed more like a moral crusade than a scientific endeavor. He popularized the term ""sociobiology,"" exploring evolutionary explanations of social behavior. And he turned it all into lucid prose, becoming one of the most effective science communicators of his time.Wilson died on Sunday in Burlington, Massachusetts, according to a statement from the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation.Like Darwin, Wilson stirred up a hornet's nest with his evolutionary theories. But in Wilson's case, the most violent attacks against him came not from religious opponents, but from fellow scientists. After the publication of his 1975 book Sociobiology, Wilson was pilloried by the biologists Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould, who accused him of justifying eugenics, sexism, and rampant capitalism. But Wilson gave as good as he got, and emerged from the battle with his reputation intact. Advertisement     
 


Born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1929, Wilson might have studied birds or mammals if not for an accident at the age of 7.


After piercing his right eye with a fishing hook, he didn't seek treatment and later had to have the lens removed. The accident left Wilson with poor distance vision, as he recounts in his 1994 autobiography, Naturalist. But his left eye remained sharp, leading him to focus on what he called ""the little things.""  Advertisement     Ants became his life's work — and led to his interest in biodiversity and the evolution of social behavior. As a Harvard fellow in the early 1950s, he traveled to Cuba, Mexico, and the South Pacific, marveling at the diversity of the ants he observed and speculating on how they could have evolved.Back at Harvard, where he spent his entire career, these thoughts eventually coalesced into The Theory of Island Biogeography, a 1967 book written with the mathematical ecologist Robert MacArthur. Wilson and MacArthur explored how species diverge into new forms on islands, and showed how their risk of extinction is highest if those islands — which can be patches of natural habitat in a human-altered landscape — are small. This idea still dominates the thinking of conservationists, as they strive to expand and connect fragments of remaining habitat to give wildlife a fighting chance of survival.
 


Ants are not only incredibly diverse, but they also boast some of the most complex societies in the animal kingdom.


Ant colonies with thousands of individuals work together to raise the young of a single queen. This had long posed a problem for Darwinian theory: In a natural world dominated by the struggle to survive and reproduce, why would female workers in social insect species have evolved to be sterile? Advertisement     In 1964, the British biologist Bill Hamilton came up with an answer. He argued that evolution is really about the reproduction and survival of genes, rather than individuals. So a gene can spread if it causes behavior that favors copies of itself in an animal's relatives. This ""kin selection"" theory made sense as an explanation for insect societies, because sister ants and bees — thanks to a quirk of their genetics — share 75% of their genes by descent, rather than the usual 50%.Hamilton was a great theorist, but a poor communicator. Wilson packaged the idea for wider consumption and united it with other work explaining the evolution of behavior. The final chapter of Sociobiology briefly discussed these ideas in the context of human society — too briefly, Wilson later admitted.""I should have been more politically careful, by saying this does not imply racism, it does not imply sexism,"" Wilson told the Harvard Gazette in 2011.The chapter enraged left-leaning academics led by his Harvard colleagues Gould and Lewontin, who published a blistering assault in the New York Review of Books invoking the horrors of Nazi Germany. Wilson was aghast, but fought back hard, accusing his critics of misrepresenting his positions. Wilson followed up in 1979 with On Human Nature, which dealt with the evolution of human behavior in more depth, and won the first of his Pulitzer prizes. (The second was for The Ants, published in 1991 with fellow ant guru Bert Hölldobler.)
 


Wilson's interest in human nature also led him to ponder the centrality of religious belief in human societies.


He lost his Baptist faith in his teens, but in his later years tried to find common ground with evangelical Christians in preserving what they view as divine creation and what he called the ""evolutionary epic."" Advertisement     Wilson didn't shy away from conflict. He spent the last few years of his life at odds with many evolutionary biologists after he rejected Hamilton's kin selection theory in a controversial 2010 paper published in Nature. The paper argued that kin selection had little value as a general explanation of sociality, and described insect colonies as ""superorganisms.""This echoed an old idea called ""group selection,"" which argued that social behavior can evolve because it benefits a group of animals, improving their survival over rival groups. In the gene-centric era, this had become a discredited theory. For the author of Sociobiology to embrace it, while rejecting kin selection, stunned his peers.In a subsequent issue of Nature, 137 leading evolutionary biologists signed a letter denouncing Wilson's about-turn. And in a later article in Prospect magazine, Richard Dawkins of Oxford University added: ""For Wilson not to acknowledge that he speaks for himself against the great majority of his professional colleagues is — it pains me to say this of a lifelong hero — an act of wanton arrogance.""Arrogance, or supreme intellectual confidence? History, and the relentless struggle between competing scientific ideas, will be the judge.

284,"Every day, decisions are being made based on rapid COVID tests. How common are false negatives?","


If you’ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately, you may have found long lines, empty shelves, and a frustrating lack of availability in general.This is happening as Omicron is making up the majority of new cases in the country, now about 95% of cases in the US.President Joe Biden recently announced that the US government is buying 500 million at-home COVID tests for the nation.While increased test availability is a good thing, those government-supplied, at-home COVID tests may not be available to request until January and could take months to be distributed. And if you are able to get your hands on rapid COVID tests, a lot of questions remain. How reliable are they? When should you use them? Do they perform differently with Omicron? Advertisement     Here are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests.When should you use rapid COVID tests?Rapid COVID tests are, well, rapidly becoming a way of life in the US. After being absent in the US for much of the pandemic, they are more widely available — and often sold out — in pharmacies and grocery stores as well as online.The pro is that they give fast results — in about 15 minutes, allowing you to make quick changes in behavior if you get a positive result.The con is that they may not be as accurate very early in an infection compared with other tests, like a PCR, that can take a day or more to get results.“Rapid tests are one of the most powerful tools that have not really been utilized in a powerful way in this pandemic,” said longtime testing advocate Dr. Michael Mina, a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer of eMed, a digital platform that facilitates at-home testing. “The government is in a position now where it’s bringing these tests forward, and now is the time to start creating a strategy around how will they be most effectively used,” he said Tuesday at a press briefing.You can take a COVID test for any reason at all, but here are the times the FDA recommends you get tested, even if you have been vaccinated.If you have COVID symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, fever, and other respiratory virus symptomsHave been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed case of COVID for a total of at least 15 minutes. (If you are unvaccinated, get tested right away; if you are fully vaccinated, get tested within five to seven days after exposure, according to the CDC.)If you took part in high-risk activities, including any time you couldn’t socially distance as recommended, such as when traveling, in crowded indoor places, or attending large gatherings or mass eventsMany people who are asymptomatic are now getting screening tests for COVID at work, school, or before or after travel or events.Although vaccines, especially when combined with a booster, are likely to protect against hospitalizations and death due to the Omicron variant, “we know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who were vaccinated,” CDC chief Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing on Wednesday. “These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others.”Regardless of vaccination status, you should wear a mask in public indoor settings. Walensky encouraged people to take at-home COVID-19 tests before gathering indoors “to help protect you and your family and friends who may be at greater risk of COVID-19 or severe outcomes.”How many different at-home COVID tests are there?There are now (at least) 11 over-the-counter antigen tests, which are the rapid tests that you can buy, take yourself, and generally cost about $20 to $35 for two — if you can find them.An antigen test detects proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can be picked up with a nasal swab.Keep in mind that no test is perfect. Any given medical test is measured by its sensitivity, or how good it is at picking up actual cases and not generating false negatives, and specificity, how good it is at ruling out people who aren’t sick and not generating false positives.Here are some of the at-home antigen tests that have been approved via the FDA’s emergency-use authorization:BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self TestiHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid TestFlowflex COVID-19 Antigen Home TestBD Veritor At-Home COVID-19 TestCareStart COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test/On/Go COVID-19 Antigen SelfTestSCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-TestInteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid TestCelltrion DiaTrust COVID-19 Ag Home TestQuidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 TestEllume COVID-19 Home TestThere are also over-the-counter molecular tests that are similar to PCR and can detect the virus earlier than an antigen test, but they cost more, Mina said. They include Detect, Cue Health, and Lucira, which can be done at home, as well as other molecular tests that are done in doctor’s offices.“Rapid molecular tests are slightly more sensitive but they are a lot more expensive,” Mina said. There are also fewer of them available. “It’s a much more difficult technology to build than a rapid antigen test,” he said.Are rapid COVID tests accurate and reliable?In general, yes. But you should know that false negatives are more likely to occur early on with rapid tests than with laboratory tests, like PCR.And it’s important to note, a small new study suggests that you can spread the virus in those early days if you are getting a false negative on a rapid antigen test.The study, which is not yet peer reviewed, included test results from 30 people out of hundreds involved in workplace outbreaks in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in December 2021. The people were fully vaccinated, many with boosters.The research team, led by epidemiologist Blythe Adamson, compared nasal swab rapid antigen tests to saliva-based and nasal-swab-based PCR test results. They found that at least four people had transmitted the virus during the time they had a false negative on a rapid test.While it’s “alarming” that the rapid tests didn’t always detect a high viral load, the study is getting a lot of attention and manufacturers will be working to update their tests, Adamson told BuzzFeed News.“FDA is paying close attention and I think manufacturers are ready to try to adapt and be agile,” she said. “So I think it will move quickly.”False positives are much less common. However, the chances of a false positive can vary by brand, ranging from one in 150 tests to one in 5,000, said Mina.That said, if your rapid test gives a positive result, you should assume you probably have COVID and isolate until you follow up with another type of test, like PCR.Rapid tests are about 30% to 40% less sensitive than PCR tests, and they are more accurate in people with symptoms than without symptoms.In one study, a popular at-home rapid test had a sensitivity of about 35% in asymptomatic people and 64% in people with symptoms when compared with PCR, but was around 100% accurate when it came to people who tested positive for COVID, whether or not they had symptoms. In the study, there were only a handful of false positives, all in asymptomatic people — but 47% were false negatives compared with PCR.These are still good tests! It’s not fair to compare rapid tests you can do at home in 15 minutes to a lab-based result that might be more accurate but takes a day or more (often many more) to get a result, Mina said. You may just need to keep all that in mind when taking a rapid test and know that taking multiple rapid tests is part of the strategy.“The test is very good when it’s positive, but when negative may frequently give you a false negative result,” said Dr. Stanley Weiss, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey.If you get a negative result, follow up with additional rapid tests in a few days to see if it becomes positive, especially if you have reason to believe that you were exposed or infected. Wait at least 24 hours for your next test, according to the CDC, but retesting a few days later can help you feel comfortable that a negative result is a true negative.Mina recommends that if you start having symptoms, assume you have Omicron and self-isolate. Take your first rapid test 24 hours after symptoms start and test again two to three days later.When interpreting and making decisions based on a test result, it’s a good idea to take into account a person’s history of vaccination, mask use, exposures to others, and their general likelihood of actually being COVID positive, Weiss said.Can rapid tests detect the Omicron variant?Yes, that seems to be the case, although the FDA recently announced that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive to Omicron than the Delta variant.It makes sense that a variant might change the reliability of the tests used to detect the virus and the FDA is asking manufacturers to test their products to make sure they work against Omicron and future variants.The FDA has identified a few PCR-based tests that don’t and have recommended that labs don’t use them.If you do have COVID symptoms, can it now take longer for tests to show a positive result than at the beginning of the pandemic?Yes, according to Mina. That’s because early in the pandemic, humans had not been exposed to the virus previously and symptoms — which are a sign the immune system recognizes and is fighting the virus — started later in the timeline of infection.Now that millions of people have either had COVID, been vaccinated, or in some cases both, symptoms generally start sooner. (And it’s clear that you can get COVID two or more times.)“You're going to become symptomatic potentially within a day after exposure because your immune system kicks in so early,” Mina said. He also noted that’s why COVID symptoms have changed and now include congestion and runny nose. “That’s your immunity working,” he said.Is a lateral flow test the same thing as an antigen test?Not exactly. A lateral flow test is a specific type where you dip a piece of paper in a liquid and after a few minutes one line appears — a positive control to show the test is working — and another line appears if the test is positive.While all rapid antigen tests currently on the market for COVID are lateral flow tests, not all lateral flow tests are COVID tests. For example, pregnancy tests also work in this way but use urine rather than a nasal swab for testing.Can a rapid test protect you from getting sick?Not really. Rapid tests are more about protecting other people, not making sure you don’t get the virus. (That’s what vaccines, masks, and social distancing are all about.)However, when people get tested before going to work, a party, school, or traveling, it helps protect everyone. (Although it also helps you get treatment sooner, which is important because almost all effective treatments for COVID are more likely to work the sooner they are started.)Rapid testing is particularly good to help stop superspreaders of the virus, Mina said.“For somebody who’s really spewing out tons of virus and is very likely to infect a lot of people, then the tests are more likely 95% or 98% sensitive for those individuals,” he said.

286,“It’s just something to watch that’s mindless and doesn’t stress you out.”,"


Every year during the holiday season, 33-year-old Christina Vineyard and her mom, Chris Caron, looked forward to their favorite tradition of watching Hallmark Christmas movies together. Vineyard, an attorney in Birmingham, Alabama, started watching the popular made-for-TV films because her mom was obsessed with the picturesque, fictional small towns, the Christmas-themed storylines, and the predictable happily-ever-after endings.This is Vineyard’s first Christmas without her mom — both of her parents died in the past year, her dad of a heart attack and her mom of breast cancer — and she hasn’t been able to bring herself to watch a Hallmark Christmas movie from start to finish yet. Advertisement  “It’s just hard, I miss watching them with her,” Vineyard said. “It was just something that we could do together that we bonded over, we always connected over it.”Vineyard and her mom recorded all the same movies on their DVRs, downloaded the Hallmark Movie Checklist app, and had even planned on attending the inaugural Christmas Con in New Jersey this December before they found out how sick Chris was. They loved watching the movies for the same reason millions of people tune in to the Hallmark Channel every holiday season: “It’s just something to watch that’s mindless and doesn’t stress you out.”
 


“It’s not political,” Vineyard added. “It’s something somebody can watch and just be happy about, something that can take your mind off the world for a little bit.”Vineyard posted a version of her story in a private Facebook group called Hallmark Christmas Movies that her mom invited her to join before she died. After sharing with the group, which is more than 22,000 members strong, Vineyard received nearly 500 likes and almost 250 comments. Someone is even sending her a package of goodies they picked up at Christmas Con a couple weeks ago.“At first I thought, Well, I’m kind of being silly posting in this group, but they didn’t make me feel silly. They make you feel like, ‘It’s okay, we’re here to cry with you.’”This Facebook group isn’t just a safe space for dedicated Hallmark fans (also known as Hallmarkies) to post about their obsessions with holiday films. Vineyard’s story about her parents is one of many Hallmarkies have shared about how they lean on Hallmark Christmas movies to heal from surgeries, cope with grief, and feel a sliver of hope and joy in a world that can otherwise seem dark and disheartening.“People need to feel good. They need to feel positive,” said Michelle Vicary, the executive vice president of programming and network publicity for Crown Media Family Networks, which owns the Hallmark Channel. “There’s so much good television that is dark, edgy, and fantastic. But in the huge spectrum of the human experience, things can also turn out okay. Life can be good and life can be positive, and people need that too. That’s where we come in and that’s where our brand comes in and delivers on an emotional experience that says, ‘You know what, things are going to turn out okay, and you’re good and life is good.’”
 


While the Facebook group is representative of a rabid fan base, its 22,000 members are only a tiny portion of the tens of millions of people who tune in to the Hallmark Channel during the holiday season. In 2019, the network has already hit record-breaking numbers since the annual Countdown to Christmas programming kicked off on Oct. 25, with 40 million unduplicated viewers having already watched holiday programming across all of Hallmark’s channels, including Hallmark Drama’s Home for the Holidays and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries’ Miracles of Christmas.People also look to Lifetime’s annual slate of Christmas movies, and other networks, like Freeform and now even Netflix, come out with new holiday movies every year. But the ratings for Hallmark Christmas movies speak for themselves, showing how the channel has cornered the market on holiday romantic dramedies.“We’ve had nearly 10 million people set reminders about upcoming movies on the checklist app, we’ve had 40 million people watch one of our services to date, and we still have so much to go before Christmas,” Vicary told BuzzFeed News. “We had 85 million people watch us last year and we’re already halfway to that before Thanksgiving. That is as mainstream as it gets.” Advertisement  The Hallmark Christmas movie empire has a wide-ranging audience (with most of its viewers being women between the ages of 25 and 54), but when it comes to its onscreen representation, the vast majority of its films lack diversity in race, ethnicity, and sexual identities. The channel has been criticized for its all-straight and mostly white Christmas movie casts; with all of its increasing content over the years, there has never been an LGBTQ couple at the center of a Christmas movie, and non-white characters are few and far between.
 


“We are much like the rest of the industry. We are making strides to correct for that, and we have great movies this year that address diversity,” Vicary said, pointing to Patti LaBelle’s A Family Christmas Gift, A Christmas Miracle starring Tamera Mowry-Housley, and A Christmas Duet with Chaley Rose and Rome Flynn. “I think that there’s still a ways to go, so I would say to our critics, thank you for continuing to come with us on this journey as we correct for that as the industry has.” Advertisement  Loyal viewers look forward to watching their favorite classics and excitedly anticipate new movies starring Hallmark’s “Christmas queens,” like Candace Cameron Bure, Autumn Reeser, and Lacey Chabert, who have built careers and personal brands around their involvement in the films. Hallmark’s Christmas movies have also cemented their place in popular culture with parody sketches on Saturday Night Live, mentions by late-night television hosts, and even a float in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.Hallmark feeds this fandom with merchandise, its checklist app, and this year, an inaugural Christmas Con event in New Jersey. It even has its own publishing division.But the movies didn’t become a cornerstone of the Hallmark brand overnight. The G-rated, holiday-themed romantic dramas have grown into a phenomenon because people want an escape from the less idealistic realities of their lives and the world around them, and because Hallmark saw the potential in early viewership numbers.
 


The Hallmark Channel originated in 2001 when it rebranded from the Odyssey Network, a cable channel that aired religious programming. In 2002, it aired its first-ever Christmas movie, Santa Jr. Original holiday movies continued to air through the years, but then the success of The Christmas Card in 2006 prompted the network to consider focusing on holiday programming. “Countdown to Christmas” was born a decade ago and features Christmas movies every weekend from the beginning of November — and now starting at the end of October — until the end of December.The popularity of the films has skyrocketed over the last decade. In 2015, 62 million unduplicated viewers tuned in to Countdown to Christmas, growing to 70 million in 2016 and 72 million in 2017. The rise in viewership inspired an increase in original Christmas movies on the channel. In 2010, there was a jump to 12 original films, and then to 16 in 2015. The following year, Hallmark bumped that number up to 19. Cut to 2019, when the network will air 24 new holiday films.“We can’t give people enough,” Vicary said. “I call it ‘the Hallmark effect’ that we’re having on people right now. When you come to us, you’re going to feel a little bit better about the world and about yourself not just from watching a show, but because of the entire brand experience.” Advertisement  And those are just the numbers for original films. From right before Halloween until New Year’s Eve, the network will show a total of 40 Christmas movies, airing a combination of the 24 new films and fan favorites from past years. Meanwhile, Hallmark is already in production on its slate for 2020 and planning for 2021.“We are Christmas all the time,” Vicary said.
 


While some of the made-for-television films have higher production values than others, they all have similar formats, and they always provide viewers with happy endings. Superfans are rarely surprised by the plots and can often guess what’s coming next for the characters onscreen. And yet, millions of people can’t get enough. These films provide a simple joy to people who want to tune out the rest of the world, especially during the holiday season. Advertisement  Jennifer Johnson, a 42-year-old 911 operator from a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia, has been a longtime Hallmarkie and uses the checklist app to keep track of her progress.Johnson’s affinity for the movies even inspired her to compare her life to a Hallmark Christmas movie three years ago, when she took a part-time retail job during the holiday season. While working two jobs to make ends meet and pay off her bills, Johnson said she developed a crush on a coworker. The two ended up falling in love and dating for a couple of years before breaking up and staying friends. It wasn’t necessarily a happily ever after, but Johnson said her real life mirrored the things she loves about Hallmark’s Christmas movies: a bit of joy amid some darkness, all taking place during the Christmas season.“Hallmark Christmas movies always have a strong female character who are never really looking for love, they always have other things going on, but they end up falling in love,” Johnson said. “And I felt like that was me. I felt like I was that strong female working to make ends meet … Hallmark Christmas movies to me are like the modern-day fairy tale.” Advertisement  As a 911 operator, Johnson said her job is incredibly stressful, and at the end of a long day at work, the movies are “absolutely an escape.”“The last thing I want to do is come home and watch a police drama or anything that remotely relates to reality because I get enough of that at work,” Johnson said. “I deal with enough of reality on a day-to-day basis.”

288,Here's how TikTok is bringing food trends to a delivery app near you.,"


This is an excerpt from Please Like Me, BuzzFeed News’ newsletter about how influencers are battling for your attention. You can sign up here.Hey,My name is Ade Onibada, and I’m a social news reporter for BuzzFeed from London. You may have previously read my newsletter hot takes like when I challenged Khloé Kardashian on that viral photo we weren’t allowed to talk about, or more recently, Black TikTok creators taking a stand against the platform in a boycott. Advertisement     Whether it was entertainment, home renovations, beauty tutorials, or restaurant reviews, 2021 was the year that turned TikTok skeptics into believers, as evidenced by the platform reaching 1 billion global users monthly back in September.You only need to scan the hashtag #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, which presently has 7.4 billion views, to see how the app has also influenced our consumer habits (it’s the sole reason I picked up the infamous Kat Von D Good Apple foundation balm).Over on #FoodTok, the cooking community on the platform responsible for introducing national treasures like Tabitha Brown to the world, simple recipes gripped audiences and now TikTok is cashing in.Rather than having to cook a viral food trend themselves, customers will be able to order for delivery from a new venture called TikTok Kitchens, announced this week in Insider. In partnership with Virtual Dining Concepts, the company plans to launch 300 ghost kitchens — the name used for restaurants that exist purely for delivery apps and don’t have storefronts — to bring fans a taste of the dishes creators on the platform popularized.Items including the infamous baked feta pasta, pasta chips, and the smash burger will be available in the first menu, launching in March, and will change quarterly.
 


Like many on TikTok, I saw Amy Wilichowski make pesto eggs — add pesto to a pan, fry eggs in delicious basil-oil-nut paste — so naturally, I too made pesto eggs.The 25-year-old from Boston makes no claims of being the creator of the recipe, but she did say that she was contacted by TikTok and offered $5,000 for her pesto eggs to be included in the new initiative. Advertisement     “I essentially signed a contract saying I was OK with them using my idea as long as I got credited for it,” Wilichowski told Please Like Me. “How it was worded was that a version of my pesto eggs will be included in TikTok Kitchens.”As the company attempts to further cash in on its online dominance with a real-world experience, you have to wonder: Who is going to want to order pesto eggs via a food delivery service about nine months after they were first introduced to the concept?Wilichowski certainly doesn’t know, noting: “That’s not something I would personally want to order on a food delivery app — the yolk is probably cold, it might harden. A sunny-side egg isn’t something you order on Uber Eats.”But she’s expecting TikTok Kitchens to make delivery-friendly pesto eggs, and she thinks her fellow foodies are due to win big, with both money and attention.“I think it’s an amazing idea because I feel like you have all these people who love making food and creating food that are going to get to be in the spotlight with this,” Wilichowski said.The registered dietician and cooking enthusiast dreams of one day owning her own restaurant, and if TikTok is true to its promise, greater things could be on the horizon for creators like her.The company is reported to be putting part of its share of the profits from this venture into supporting creators.In a strange development, when I reached out to TikTok for clarity on which other food content creators had been tapped, a spokesperson called the campaign announcement “premature” and said that things were “still very much in the planning stages.”How the company will unravel the question of who these recipes belong to and if a trending recipe can exist outside of the trending moment is yet to be determined, but I suspect those are the details you figure out when you’re “still very much in the planning stage.”
 


While TikTok is trying to cook us dinner, British journalist Symeon Brown is turning up the heat on the influencer economy in his upcoming book Get Rich or Lie Trying, which I was able to get an advanced copy of since I’m lucky enough to know him IRL.Brown has previously reported on Instagram’s self-styled finance bros, dubbed the “wolves of Instagram,” who routinely promote risky financial products, and use their social media to show off a lavish lifestyle and recruit their unassuming victims.There’s never been a shortage of criticisms of influencers, but a quick search for literature on the broader industry is more likely to turn up suggestions of how you too can become an influencer and transform your basic social media profile into a money-making vehicle while unlocking the girlboss that lies dormant in you.Given that 86% of young Americans reportedly want to become social media influencers, Brown asks the question: “Do they know what they’re letting themselves in for?”Beyond the success stories and household names that have dominated digital culture and carry clout capital, there is a long line of influencers-in-waiting constantly repackaging themselves against a backdrop of financial insecurity and rabid competition.LA YouTube pranksters, OnlyFans creators, dropshippers, the list goes on, and Brown introduces it all while interrogating the dark side of the attention economy.“When the lockdown happened, everyone on my feed was trying to make a buck online,” Brown told me. “My timeline was filled with pyramid schemes, dodgy crypto coins, or friends desperately trying to grow their social media followings to join the growing ranks of digital hustlers.”Money wasn’t the only factor though. “The pivot to influencer is as much about the new capital of internet popularity as it is about pervasive economic precarity,” Brown said. “The book was really trying to tell the story of an ambitious generation who feel shortchanged, disillusioned, and instead of beating the system, believe they have to join it by any means — get rich or lie trying.”Till I can figure out what viral meal I can make to earn a quick $5,000, I’ll meditate this festive season on Brown’s words and wonder how influencers will handle the third year of a global pandemic.Happy holidays,Ade

290,"“I can’t say I’m unhappy about this extension,” one woman told BuzzFeed News about Biden delaying the student loan payment deadline, “but it’s hardly enough for the millions of borrowers suffering.”","



 


When the COVID pandemic first struck, Johanna Daile, a third-year student studying history and psychology at John A. Logan College in Carterville, Illinois, knew they would have trouble concentrating in virtual classes. Having already accumulated $58,000 of debt over three years of college, they decided to temporarily quit school during the pandemic to focus on paying back their loans.But the pandemic continued — and got worse. Daile, then an assistant manager at Dairy Queen, relocated to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, to be near family in September 2020. They transferred to another Dairy Queen location, working the same position for less pay. The 24-year-old switched jobs a few more times before finding their current position at Kay Jewelers.Because they did not graduate, Daile wasn’t able to get their loans deferred, and going back to school isn’t possible without taking out even more loans. Their payments are up to $750 per month — over half of their paycheck. They want to resume their education, but the risk of taking on even more debt severely limits their options, Daile told BuzzFeed News. Now their goal is to return to school by 2025, if they are able.Student loan debt is an overwhelming burden shared by over 40 million Americans. It can follow people throughout their lives and lock them out of significant milestones like buying a home or, in Daile’s case, obtaining a degree. Advertisement     Under the CARES Act, student loan repayments were paused, and the federal student loan interest rates were set at 0% as of March 2020. In August this year, a month before the pause was set to expire, President Joe Biden pushed the deadline to resume payments to Jan. 31, 2022.As COVID cases surged this past month, the president on Wednesday announced that he would extend the pause to May 1, 2022. But Biden — who promised on the campaign trail to forgive $10,000 in student loan debt per borrower — has not indicated that he will cancel student debt outright, as progressive lawmakers have demanded, a move that would provide immense financial relief to millions of Americans.In his announcement of the extension, Biden acknowledged the difficulties that over 40 million borrowers have faced during the pandemic.“Now, while our jobs recovery is one of the strongest ever — with nearly 6 million jobs added this year, the fewest Americans filing for unemployment in more than 50 years, and overall unemployment at 4.2 percent — we know that millions of student loan borrowers are still coping with the impacts of the pandemic and need some more time before resuming payments,” Biden said in his Dec. 22 statement.Biden also promised that the Department of Education would offer support programs in the meantime and to help borrowers make payments come May 2022. But many borrowers told BuzzFeed News the extension doesn’t remotely solve the dire financial issue of $1.7 trillion owed in US student loan debt (including federal and nonfederal loans).“I just wish that it could help those who cannot afford to finish their education and those with private student loans because it was their only choice,” Daile said. “Adults in [the] upper-middle class and upper class can survive, but lower-middle class to low class, we are barely surviving with our payments.”
 


Student loan debt is just not a problem for millennials, according to Alan Collinge, founder of StudentLoanJustice.org, a group that advocates for total cancellation. More than half of all borrowers are over 35 years old, according to Department of Education data from 2020. Older people owe more than younger people, even though they may have borrowed less money initially years ago, Collinge said in the group’s response to Biden’s extension this week.BuzzFeed News reached out to members of the “Student Loan Justice” Facebook group, where borrowers share their stories and support one another. Many of them reacted to Biden administration’s recent extension with deeply personal stories.Kristina Allen, 52, lives near San Francisco and has one more online class to earn a bachelor’s degree in nursing from Regis University. She initially took loans out when she began studying to become a registered nurse as her twin daughters attended college. She graduated in 2008.
 


“I was a single mom in poverty, and I desperately wanted my twins and their little sister to have a better life,” Allen said, adding that her three daughters are all college graduates now. “My granddaughter doesn't know what hungry is, so the cycle of poverty stopped.”Over the years, Allen has paid off $90,000 in loans but still owes about $75,000; her initial loan was less than half that amount. Between 2015 and 2016, around her third year of the bachelor’s program at Regis, Allen defaulted on her federal loans and was charged exorbitant interest and fees. She‘s also subjected to a wage garnishment, which means a percentage of her disposable income is being withheld until her loan is paid off or considered not in default. One-quarter of her pretax income has been garnished since 2017 until the first pause in loan repayment came during the Trump administration, she said.Biden’s announcement of a loan repayment extension came as a relief. But once payments restart in the spring, Allen believes she’ll have to “drop her dream” of a master’s degree to focus paying off her loans with the wage garnishment.“Retirement? A home of our own? Not even a thought,” Allen, who said she has lupus and a related blood clot disorder, told BuzzFeed News. The repayment pause has given her a much-needed financial break to afford care for her husband, who has end-stage cancer, as well as address her own health issues she’s neglected. But, Allen said, she can’t afford to move closer to family and friends in New England; she needs her current work-provided health insurance to pay for her husband’s chemotherapy, support herself, and pay the loans.“I'd like to work less and take care of my own health, but I can't, because of my loans,” Allen said.Like Allen, Michael Goolsby, a 56-year-old who works at a Walmart in Fernley, Nevada, said Biden’s new deadline will postpone his wage garnishment; he told BuzzFeed News that, since 2019, 15% of his paycheck has been withheld to pay off his loans. Goolsby has a bachelor’s and master’s in history from Colorado State University; when he finished his master’s in 1991, he had $25,000 in student loan debt.The following year, he was told he faced a default. As a result, his school would not release his transcripts to potential employers, he said. He accepted an offer in early 1994 to consolidate his debt under a Sallie Mae program, which required him to take out a $36,000 loan. But multiple payment deferments and defaults only compounded his debt, causing him to fall behind no matter how much he worked, he said, ultimately leading to a wage garnishment. He said he’s trying to keep other debts down so he can eventually declare bankruptcy.His student loan debt now stands at more than $100,000, he said.“I did many things over time for a job, from driving a truck, managing a fast-food restaurant, working on an assembly line, being a paralegal for a San Francisco law firm for six years, working in IT doing technical support for 15 years, and then driving a cab and leaving California for Reno, Nevada, because that's where the jobs are nowadays as I work towards retirement, which may not even be on my 65th birthday in 2030,” Goolsby said. “But here I am.”
 


Justin Schanck, 43, a teacher in Macon, Georgia, said he owes $80,000 in loans from his combined graduate and undergraduate degrees.“I went to grad school to try and better my life and increase my income, only to add on more loans,” he told BuzzFeed News. Schanck said he blames himself for not thinking about the cost of a graduate degree, “but this predatory lending system certainly did not help.”Not using his hard-earned money to pay off his loans during the pandemic has allowed his family to “reinvest” in his community, he said. They put a new roof on their house to stop a ceiling leak and have been determined to shop from local businesses.“Once the payments start again, that money will essentially be taken away from the local economy,” Schanck said.Yirzely Villanueva, 27, of Canyon Country, California, said she feels both “relieved and stressed'' by the extension. She told BuzzFeed News she has over $40,000 in debt from a master’s degree in teaching from the University of Southern California. She said she’s happy that interest is paused for now and she can pay back “exactly” what she borrowed.“My loan is 60% of my savings and so I'm stuck,” she said. “I either pay off my loan and stay broke, or wait and be in debt indefinitely.”As a Mexican American woman, Villanueva said she feels like the “deck is already stacked” against her when it comes to taking out loans for a home or a car. “With my luck, I'm scared once I hit ‘pay’ [my student loans] will be canceled.”She said the extension makes her wonder why borrowers aren’t being allowed to just pay back their loans without interest.“I feel like I'm just stuck in a horror movie waiting for the ‘interest monster’ to get me,” she said.
 


Like others, Lyndsey Summers, a 31-year-old in Portland, Oregon, said the extension is not enough. “I can’t say I’m unhappy about this extension, but it’s hardly enough for the millions of borrowers suffering,” Summers told BuzzFeed News.She said she owes nearly $75,000 from her bachelor’s degree in communication media from Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania. She’s had trouble qualifying for public loan forgiveness and said she “struggles to get by” given her loans and her salary as a journalist. She said it’s been difficult trying to talk to the government and her loan servicer, with long hold times on the phone.“It is the servicer who works with borrowers, and when you ask them for specific information, they point to the school,” Summers said. “The schools don’t have to keep records, by the way, for longer than 5 years — at least according to my institution. I wanted to see an itemized receipt for how my loans were applied to my education. I have no idea if I’ll get an answer. It would have been nice to be notified that records would be destroyed.”Although state schools are “supposed to be more affordable,” Summers pointed out, it wasn’t for her. “I just want to be able to buy a home and get ahead.”Amy (who asked that BuzzFeed News only use her first name for privacy), 55, is a former teacher in Louisiana. She said she originally borrowed $46,000 when she started her undergraduate degree in 1997; after “faithfully” paying off the loans for nearly two decades, she still owes $30,800.
 


“I owe almost as much now as I borrowed, even after 20 years of payments!” Amy told BuzzFeed News. “I have resigned to the fact that I will never in my lifetime be able to pay them off. I will take them to my grave.”Amy said she has applied for teacher forgiveness programs in the past but has always been denied. “I really thought President Biden would follow through with his promises to help Americans such as myself that have been taken advantage of by a predatory loan system,” she said. “It looks like I was wrong.”
 



"
291,The media allowed misinformation to frame “debates” about trans identity and race in education. That has to change.,"


Earlier this month, British media once again platformed a talking point pushed by anti-trans activists. The Sunday Times, among other outlets, ""reported"" on a backlash to a hypothetical scenario in which a sex offender might choose to identify as a woman. That an imaginary notion was elevated into a news item speaks to the entrenched anti-transness of British media.But then Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling tweeted the article, further elevating the narrative; she became a trending topic on Twitter, promoting a link between transness and sexual violence. US media covered her tweet as a controversy that implied there might be a real threat posed by trans self-determination. It might be too obvious to state, but there isn’t. In fact, there is actually an ongoing epidemic of violence against trans women, and no such pattern of trans women committing violence against cis women or anyone else.This was, however, the latest point of panic in a wave reacting to the so-called transgender tipping point of visibility. And Rowling in particular has chosen to make herself the face of this backlash. Advertisement  Just last year, she publicly targeted clinics where trans youth receive lifesaving gender-affirming treatment, turning trans bodily self-determination into a story about the supposedly threatened safety of cis children. She has also mocked evolving public health language that includes trans men and nonbinary people, hijacking that recognition to create a story about the supposed erasure of cis women.Like fellow billionaire Peter Thiel, she has even reportedly deployed her money and power to try to silence criticism. And yet all the while her anti-trans campaigning is generally characterized by the media as “controversial” “views”: not part of an explicit agenda, but an ongoing human interest mystery chronicled as a perplexing personal evolution.Rowling’s status as a celebrity billionaire affords her extra protection and the benefit of the doubt while also helping to amplify her talking points. But it’s specifically because she speaks as a white woman with “concerns” about the safety of women and children that her anti-trans framing is accepted on Twitter and treated by the media at large as worthy of debate. Advertisement  Never explicitly framed as a misinformation agent who might merit deplatforming, Rowling is a symptom of the current media ecosystem, in which disinformation about minority identities is accepted as legitimate controversy.This scenario comes into play whenever powerful people, institutions, or political organizations raise public concerns about the protection of majority groups, especially white women and children.In fact, two of the biggest, seemingly unrelated, culture war stories this year were propelled by a similar reframing of misinformation as legitimate debate. These so-called controversies were supposedly about trans people, especially trans girls and women, and teaching history, known as the critical race theory debate.Both were part of political backlashes that came in response to increased visibility for minority groups: increased representation of trans people in media and public debate about gender and the Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of the murder of George Floyd.Framed largely by right-wing activists and think tanks as human interest issues about fairness in sports and classrooms, they circulated into national legacy media — including publications like USA Today, CBS, The Atlantic, and the New York Times — through first-person opinion pieces by mothers of cis athletes raising fears about trans inclusion or human interest reports featuring on-the-ground stories of white moms airing complaints about supposed radical ideas being introduced in schools. Advertisement  Whatever the content of the reporting or articles, in platforming these issues through the “concerns” of cis and white people, mainstream media helped distort what constitutes legitimate perspectives for coverage, and in doing so sidelined the actual difficulties experienced by marginalized communities, including Black and trans youth.Ultimately, this kind of coverage raises deeper questions about news organizations and who decides the perspective of “culture war” journalism.
 


There’s a long history in the US of setting the terms of debate by centering media narratives around the well-being of white women and children. It’s usually associated with anti-Black and anti-gay right-wing activism and can be traced back to anti–school integration campaigns in the ’60s, through “save the children” anti-gay campaigns in the ’70s, and even the coverage questioning how children would fare under marriages between same-sex couples in the aughts.Right-wing activists used similar framing to introduce the so-called controversy over “critical race theory.” Attempts to eradicate histories of race in the US are nothing new. As recently as 2011, activists attempted to ban ethnic studies and Mexican American studies curricula in Arizona. But “ethnic studies” simply doesn’t have the polarizing — or “concerning” — ring necessary to stoke a national panic about existing curricular offerings like studying civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Advertisement  The term “critical race theory” was perfect for right-wing campaigns, though, because, as one activist told the New Yorker this summer, to “most” Americans it “connotes hostile, academic, divisive, race-obsessed, poisonous, elitist, anti-American.” So a long-term campaign to dismantle any talk of race and history in schools was rebranded as a crusade against critical race theory, even though that term actually refers to a graduate-level theory about the intersections of law, culture, and structural racism that has nothing to do with elementary history in classrooms.
 


The idea of the country as race-obsessed and race discourse as destructively divisive was already percolating in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests, especially after George Floyd’s murder.Outlets like the New York Times and the Atlantic dedicated valuable resources to reporting on the supposed excesses of anti-racism. These “nuance” stories by white journalists included one about a Black father’s school board campaign against anti-racism. In the Times, there was a story about a Black student who made a supposedly false accusation of racial profiling at Smith College. Even attempts at self-reflection centered whiteness and painted anti-racism as an elitist concern; a story about the Times’ own newsroom racism was used to highlight how privileged white high schoolers now felt entitled to call out racism.Right-wing think tanks, like the Manhattan Institute, promoted that precise notion online and in legacy media to activate parents into believing anti-racism was out of control. Quotes from concerned moms further stoked these fears: “They are making my son feel like a racist because of the pigmentation of his skin.”The idea of “talking about race” wasn’t necessarily new to many Black and brown parents for whom discussing the realities of inequality and existing in a white world isn’t an “option” in the same way. Yet outlets including CBS and the Atlantic picked up that framing too, feeding into the sense that radically new ideas were suddenly being introduced with headlines like, “When the culture war comes for the kids,” and “How young is too young to teach kids about race?” (The latter headline was changed after a backlash.)As the November elections neared, news stories about suburban or small-town parents battling over school curricula started popping up as well. The framing of these battles through reported human interest stories, rather than, say, misinformation explainers, suggested that these were newsworthy grassroots issues that spoke to broad parental fears rather than a vocal minority stoking social media disinformation.To some degree, the stories discredited the panic about race education in schools by pointing out the organizations and dark money groups (like the Judicial Crisis Network) who helped fund these campaigns and including voices of supporters of existing curriculums. But they still promoted the idea that these battles represented two equal sides of inflamed national feelings, rather than a strategically invented controversy and well-funded top-down disinformation campaigns.Ultimately, the timing and framing of these stories about race and education highlight that they were not deemed newsworthy because of concerns of the community members at the center, Black parents and youth, or the massive ongoing inequality around race and class that still permeates public schools. Instead, they helped reframe debate to center white parental anxieties.
 


In many ways, this same scenario — misinformation platformed as debate — has been playing out in the coverage of trans people, long before J.K. Rowling seized the moment as a major anti-trans voice. Newsrooms lacking in trans journalists had been framing trans existence through “concerns” that trans people were incapable of deciding their bodily self-determination on their own.This type of clueless question about how young is too young for children to know their gender, coming from outside the trans community, was epitomized by a now-infamous 2018 Atlantic cover story. It explicitly addressed imagined anxious white parents with the (misgendering) headline, “Your child says she’s trans...she’s 13.”The story and its cis panic about trans identity as some kind of trend among teens was later completely debunked by other news outlets. Since then, gender historians have shown the long history of trans children, studies have confirmed that trans children are just as certain about their gender as cis teens. The Atlantic never officially apologized for the story’s framing, including misgendering and outing the cover model. (The writer, however, has since been placed on watch lists for anti-LGBTQ journalism).
 


In the real world, all trans people are not white and not middle class and have little access to healthcare even if they can find an affirming clinic, especially when most insurance companies refuse to cover such care. Trans people struggle not with identity itself, but with an anti-trans world that restricts access to resources for transition and features gatekeepers who set rules and timelines on cis terms. And unsurprisingly, November’s elections saw right-wing activists promoting a new wave of bills blocking access to healthcare for trans people. As GLAAD pointed out, that Atlantic cover story was used in a legal brief filed by seven state attorneys general in a federal lawsuit seeking to roll back existing healthcare access for trans people.This year, right-wing activists expanded their “concern” to sports. And it wasn’t an accident they set that arena as a location to invent debate. Like classrooms, sports are imagined by white Americans as a neutral space of meritocracy, and right-wing think tanks purposely promoted that setting for human interest stories about fairness.Publications including USA Today and the Economist took the bait, uncritically platforming first-person pieces by white mothers and white athletes airing out concerns about maybe having to compete against trans girls. The misinformation spread by cis athletes about hormonal or strength differences was ultimately debunked.But real questions about meritocracy, including around race and class inequality, did not even get folded into these chronicles, revealing that narratives were about the protection of supposedly endangered young white women. This becomes clearer when considering that the surveillance regarding testosterone levels has primarily targeted cis Black women athletes.Given the minority status of trans people in society at large, it’s unsurprising that trans athletes never even materialized in most states where the bills were being pushed. Yet even positive human interest pieces about trans athletes were reactive ones in which trans humanity was rendered visible only in terms of the wave of cis fears.As with the CRT coverage, the focus on questions about youth transition or sports isn’t actually about the struggles of trans people at all, which include disproportionately high rates of housing insecurity and under or unemployment.The sidelining of actual trans issues in order to debate imaginary fears does, however, speak to broader systemic problems with media and the way that trans people circulate as objects of coverage for cis people rather than subjects of their own reality. Even media attempts to cover anti-trans activism have turned into debates between cis women about transness through controversies about trans exclusionary radical feminists (TERFS).That moniker itself, recently used to describe Rowling, platforms anti-trans activists within the context of feminism and has lent legitimacy to their efforts, portraying bigotry as some kind of newfangled intellectual exercise over the meaning of feminism or queer community. In fact, anti-transness is part of a long history of class and racial exclusions in feminism, both in media and, most importantly, in the real world, where trans identity has been made into a scapegoat for anger about inequality more broadly.
 


It’s unquestionable that the CRT and trans “debates” have been pushed into the media by right-wing activism and conservative politicians through strategic waves of anti-CRT and anti-trans bills. They’re even timed to purposely inflame conservatives and rally the base for elections.But at this point, it’s too easy to see anti-trans and anti-Black concern-mongering as just an issue of right-wing misinformation. After all, these framings are accepted for coverage via the editorial judgments of majority white and cis newsrooms.So-called culture war issues are where the media allows itself maximal editorializing on behalf of cis white “anxieties” and fears about a changing world. But the terms for what becomes a culture war story are not decided by the public. Instead, they are decided in newsrooms that don’t mirror reality but certainly help shape it.American newsrooms are even whiter than the country as a whole, and it’s in that context of media echo chambers that “critical race theory” is repackaged as controversial. Most Americans believe the history of slavery should be taught, for instance. And after the 2021 November election, polls showed that even the idea that critical race theory drove elections was overstated.Similarly, trans rights are actually not “controversial” in the US population at large. But trans journalists are woefully underrepresented in newsrooms. It’s predictable that cis journalists talking to each other about transness results in stories that home in on and magnify cis debates about trans identity. This dynamic sidelines the potential richness of good faith exchanges within the trans community about the complexity of existing in a cis world. Advertisement  Current thinking about misinformation is focused on anti-science or partisan campaigns that exist in the social media ether. But there are other important questions, like the way the media feeds into misinformation by platforming sources that reframe debate outside the terms of the communities these “debates” actually affect.
 


“Partisanship” is still the favored term in journalism for talking about media “balance.” But considering editorial judgment through partisanship simply recreates existing power imbalances by focusing on issues about race, class, and gender only if they’re legible through the lens of Republican vs. Democrat. It would mean something quite different if corporate media held itself accountable to the communities it covers rather than political parties.Categorizing questions about ethical coverage through partisanship issues also helps ignore uncomfortable realities about news capitalism, like the fact that newsrooms need to make a profit and stories are often packaged for advertisers and imagined white readers.Financial incentives are a major reason why it’s hard to wean media off engaging with misinformative framings to capture cis and white readers, which still constitute a majority of the public. After all, these panicked stories feed engagement for Twitter, Facebook, legacy media, and new venture capitalist corporate platforms like Substack.It’s not an accident that in all the race and trans backlash stories, class is invoked not to call out how white middle- and upper-class perspectives shape newsrooms (including through media CEOs). Instead, it is invoked to imply that anti-racism or trans rights are somehow an “elitist” concern. This framing takes pressure off the publications themselves to engage with these issues as a labor concern in their own newsrooms. But divorcing stories about class and identity from the real world and existing power structures is a distortion. Framing and context shouldn’t only be dictated by cis white fears and concerns.Still, there have been some changes by newsrooms around the framing of stories to acknowledge power imbalances in the real world. The Verge has updated its policies for giving big tech companies anonymity as background sources for articles. Some news organizations are questioning the uncritical use of police sources when ascertaining the truth of events. Cis and white “concerned parents” might be less obviously identifiable as problematic sources, but it’s a powerful category of people due for a similar reckoning.Tellingly, after a backlash to the white framing of its “how young is too young” CRT story, CBS changed the headline — not to, say, “White Parents Are Finally Having to Grapple with Questions Others Routinely Do.” Instead, it was replaced with a nonclickbait-y mouthful: “Documentary explores debate over how and when race should be taught in schools.”That shift of the framing to “debate” is the customary way mainstream media dodges any pressure about “taking sides.” But platforming “both sides” implies we live in an already equal world. We don’t. And that’s a fact. ●

292,"The card features the first photo of the Sussexes' daughter Lilibet ""Lili"" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor.","


The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, aka Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, on Thursday shared the first image of their daughter, Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, in a family portrait featured on their official Christmas card.The photo shows the family of four laughing as Meghan holds her daughter in her arms. Six-month-old Lilibet, nicknamed ""Lili,"" is the Sussexes' second child. Their son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, was born May 6, 2019. As the Christmas card photo shows, Archie has inherited his father's distinctive red hair. Advertisement     ""This year, 2021, we welcomed our daughter, Lilibet, to the world. Archie made us a 'Mama' and a 'Papa,' and Lili made us a family,"" Harry and Meghan said in their card.""As we look forward to 2022, we have made donations on your behalf to several organizations that honor and protect families — from those being relocated from Afghanistan, to American families in need of paid parental leave.""According to the card and a statement from Harry and Meghan's charitable entity, the Archewell Foundation, the couple made contributions to: Team Rubicon; Welcome.US; Human First Coalition; Humanity Crew; Paid Leave For All; PL+US; and Marshall Plan for Moms.""Wishing you a happy holiday season and a prosperous New Year, from our family to yours! As ever, Harry, Meghan, Archie, and Lili,"" the Sussexes signed the card.
 


The picture was taken by photographer (and Polish prince) Alexi Lubomirski, who also took the couples' official engagement and wedding photos.On Thursday, he shared the family portrait to his personal Instagram with a caption about his experience shooting the Sussexes.""This is one of those rare and special projects, that one is fortunate enough to be a part of,"" he said. ""To be able to continue the story of this family whom I first photographed as an engaged couple, then on the day of their wedding, as a married couple and now seeing their love manifest into two beautiful children, has been a delightful honour."" Advertisement     ""To be trusted by your subjects enough, to open themselves up and have their connection documented and translated into an image, is one of the greatest gifts a photographer can have,"" Lubomirski wrote. ""This day with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex was one such joyous experience, and one that I feel extremely privileged to have been invited to capture.""
 


This year's picture is different from the family's 2020 holiday card, which was a stylized image of Harry, Meghan, and Archie with the family's rescue dogs, Guy, a beagle, and Pula, a black lab.“The original photo of the family was taken at their home earlier this month by The Duchess’s mother,"" a Sussex spokesperson told People at the time. ""The small Christmas tree, including the homemade ornaments and other decorations, were selected by Archie, and the tree will be replanted after the holidays.”Harry and Meghan have carefully guarded their children's privacy since moving to the United States in March 2020. They successfully sued a paparazzi agency for taking drone footage of their son, Archie, in the home where they first stayed in California, winning a settlement and an apology from X17, the company that took the photos and made them available for sale.In the couple's bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey in March, Meghan talked about how scared she was to pose for pictures with Archie in front of the world's press soon after he was born, the way that her sister-in-law has done with each of her three pregnancies.""I was very scared of having to offer up our baby,"" she said. The Sussexes would wait until two days after Archie's birth to appear before cameras with their son.
 


No longer working members of the royal family, Harry and Meghan have been able to keep their daughter away from the media for the first six months of her life.Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born June 4 at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in California and weighed 7 pounds, 11 ounces. She is named after her great-grandmother, the Queen, and her paternal grandmother, Diana, Princess of Wales.On June 6, Harry and Meghan released a personal statement alongside the news of the birth of their child.""On June 4th, we were blessed with the arrival of our daughter, Lili,"" they said. ""She is more than we could have ever imagined, and we remain grateful for the love and prayers we’ve felt from across the globe. Thank you for your continued kindness and support during this very special time for our family.""

294,"Soup dumplings, yes please ","


2021 was our second year of working from home and the year we really ramped up our home cooking efforts. How’d we do it? Ordering frozen soup dumplings by mail, fancy pizza ovens and grills, and an unassuming, but incredibly effective herb preserver.These items were independently selected by staff and except where noted, they spent their own money on it. Just so you know, BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them. Oh, and FYI — prices are accurate and items in stock as of the time of publication.
 


Traeger Ironwood pellet grill — $1,400–$1,600 at TragerThe Traeger Ironwood pellet grill is hands down the best thing I have tried this year largely because it is responsible for so many exquisitely smoky meals but also because I am a huge barbecue dork and this may well be the holy grail (Traeger loaned BuzzFeed a grill to review). I have yet to cook a bad meal on this thing, and I have cooked more than a few of those in the past on our former grill (RIP) — despite, say, setting multiple overnight alarms to check the grill temp on a 32-hour brisket. It’s hard to explain the catastrophic despondency and frustration of discovering that a brisket you have obsessively babied with techniques painstakingly sourced from 50 different BBQ subreddits looks and tastes like the bottom of an old flip flop. But the Traeger pellet grill has, for me, made that a thing of the past. Instead of charcoal, it burns pellets methodically fed to it by a temperature-controlled auger that capably holds a slow-and-low smoke for as long as you need it to (and has a special “super smoke” feature). And it has nailed everything I’ve cooked on it — chicken, ribs, brisket, pork shoulder, sausage — in a way that’s often inspired “this is your best INSERT FOOD HERE yet” accolades from family and friends. Honestly, I wish I’d saved up (it is not cheap), gritted my teeth, and bought this a few years ago. —John Paczkowski
 


Shipment of frozen soup dumplings from Xiao Chi Jie — $39.95 at Xiao Chi JieThis Seattle-based restaurant will mail you a packet of 50 frozen soup dumplings (xiao long bao) that you keep in your freezer and then cook drunkenly when you come home late but want to reward yourself with the most delicious food known to man.For the uninitiated, soup dumplings are humanity’s greatest achievement. You bite the top off, sip out the delicious filling, then consume them with the sauce of your choice. Incredible.These ones are filled with either pork, shrimp and pork, or chicken. Of course, they also sell the accompanying sauces. There’s the classic vinegar, as well a chilli crisp oil that deserves to be studied and a ginger and scallion umami source which I want to bathe in. They also sell bamboo steamers if you need one.They even offer a VIP Dumpling Program where they’ll mail you packets every month if you want, which is a truly spectacular idea for which they deserve to make a fortune. —David Mack Advertisement  
 


Tomato pieI had never heard of tomato pie until this summer. If you had asked me if tomato pie was a thing, I suppose I would have said yes? I don’t know. Life before tomato pie is all a blur. Here’s what I remember: going to a farmers market on the way home from a weekend at a rental upstate, being overwhelmed by the produce selection, and almost doing what I always do when overwhelmed by farmers market produce, which is buy some token non-produce item (a baked good, honey, soap) and leave, but then my husband said, “What if we buy a bunch of heirloom tomatoes and make a tomato pie?” It was such a sure-footed plan, offered up as though we had ever made a tomato pie before, that there could be no response but to buy those tomatoes and make that pie. I would provide a recipe, but I actually just googled around and cobbled together a few. The gist is this: You cut up the tomatoes and drain them a bit, you layer them in a pie crust with basil, and then you top it off with a mozzarella/mayonnaise mixture that doesn’t taste mayonnaisey once you’re done. Then you bake it. It’s basically like a fresher, tomato-first take on pizza, and it’s the best possible solution to late-summer farmers market decision fatigue. —Sam Henig
 


The Ooni Koda 12-inch pizza oven — $319 at Williams Sonoma, BloomingdalesI lusted after this pizza oven for several years before I finally bought it, and when I did buy it, it was as a Christmas gift for my dad. But playing with his forced me to pony up for one of my own. It was just too good.Here’s why:It gets really hot — 950 degrees hot. There are things for which a regular household oven is simply not hot enough, and they are where the Ooni shines.It does more than pizza! Throw in a cast-iron skillet with broccoli, or asparagus, or brassica steaks, or actual steaks, and you’ll have a fantastic meal ready in just a few minutes. Seriously: There are so many applications here. Kebabs! Naan! Branzino!The pizzas are fantastic. Truly better than any I’ve had at a restaurant. Your edges will get a bit singed, and that is not bad. I prefer a quick prebake of the crust (with continuous rotation for an even bake) before adding sauces and toppings. For an unconventional but delicious white pie, roast a big head of garlic, mash it, and whisk it into a bechamel with some fresh sage. Sub this for the tomato sauce and top with your choice of veggies. —Emily Baker-White
 


Ayako & Family Hanabi plum jam — $16 at Ayako & FamilyI choose to believe that jam can be classified as tech because my body is a machine and food makes it work. This summer, I was expecting to make up about 50% of my food intake with fruit. But for whatever reason, I couldn’t get the fix I needed; almost all the stone fruit I ate was grainy and tasteless, not at all the sunshiny flavor I craved. So I decided to make up for it with fancy jam in the fall and winter. When I say fancy, I mean that this stuff is $16 a jar. But Alessandra Gordon, a second-generation jam-maker, makes the headiest preserves from plum varieties I’ve never heard of. This jam is not at all too sweet; one spoon of the rich, dark Hanabi Plum jam on yogurt tastes like something I’d pay $15 for at a really, really nice brunch place. It’s basically saving money. Plus, once you consider that the company’s base wage is $18 per hour and the staff is all people of color and/or queer, the price feels more than right. —Estelle Tang
 


Anova steam oven — $599 at AnovaMy wife tersely refers to the Anova Precision Oven as “another of your unnecessary kitchen gadgets.” And yet, she has eaten, with great gusto, the cooked-to-perfection focaccia I’ve made in it. She has also eaten the baguettes I made in it during a baguette marathon that had me baking bread every two days for over a month. And that pork shoulder slow-cooked for 12 hours in a sous vide steam bath? She ate that too. Same thing with a *shockingly* good pizza. So sure, it’s unnecessary, and yes, it is perhaps reckless to spend $599 on an oven that cooks with steam when you already have a real oven. But steam makes for better bread crusts, and cooking sous vide gets foods at the perfect temperature pretty much without fail. And this thing kind of does it all — air-frying and baking, included — and it does it well, and you can run it from an app on your phone. If my kitchen and bank account were both larger, I’d probably buy one. (Anova loaned BuzzFeed an oven to review.) —John Paczkowski
 


Honey-Can-Do herb preserver — $12.69 at AmazonAfter years of watching cilantro and basil rot in the fridge, I finally broke down and bought an herb preserver. My husband and children were highly skeptical, but the cilantro was fresh and green a full TWO WEEKS later. I enjoyed fresh cilantro on three separate dinners (if you’re wondering: guacamole, butter chicken, Vietnamese tofu, and pork). It fits perfectly in the door of the fridge, and at only $13, it’ll pay for itself in a couple of months easily. —Dao Nguyen
 


The Original Baking Steel — $119 at Baking SteelLook, I am fully aware of how ridiculous it must seem to be endorsing a $119 kitchen gadget that is essentially a piece of steel plating pulled off an aircraft carrier, but this thing has proven to be an incredible ally when it comes to baking bread, pizza — anything with a crust, really. The Original Baking Steel is just that — 16 pounds of it. And because steel retains and conducts heat more efficiently than other materials, it can pizzeria the hell out of your kitchen. The Baking Steel’s creators claim it can function as the “equivalent of a 900° wood-fired oven despite being in your 500° home oven.” I have no idea whatsoever if this is true. What I can say is that the bread and pizza I have cooked on it definitely looked and tasted like it, which is all that matters, really. —John PaczkowskiOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

295,"In some corners of the internet, it’s not “no.” It’s “naur.”","


I’m Australian, so I’m used to “shrimp on the barbie” and “a dingo ate my baby” jokes. I’ll even laugh politely if you gesture at my cutlery and say, “Call that a knife?” But this year, a new Aussie gag entered the fray, courtesy of the internet. Instead of the usual Steve Irwin impressions, my American friends started ribbing me for the simplest and most unexpected particularity: the way I pronounce the word “no.” Apparently, I say it “naur”; if I’m being really feisty, I say it “naurrrrrrrrrr.”In 2021, “naur” became a meme, thanks to the alchemical meaning-making of the internet. Viral tweets and TikToks spread the joke like Vegemite on toast, and before long, it was appearing in places Crocodile Dundee himself never ventured. In April, video footage of a gigantic outdoor swing went viral — you can hear a person loudly saying “no” in an Australian accent — when someone retweeted it with the disbelieving caption “i cant they really say ‘naur’ LMFAOOOO.” Various “naur” jokes ensued: “Naur” became a topic of conversation on Botched. Fans of the musician Mitski dubbed her hit song “Naurbody,” and people imagined what it would be like to get a marriage proposal rejected Down Under. (This joke about Normani — I won’t spoil it for you — is my favorite example.)In another timeline, the joke would have ended there, relevant only to Australians and people who like to be mean to Australians. But it didn’t. Advertisement  
 


Even before “naur” became a main character on social media, people were attempting Australian mimicry online. Actor Brian Jordan Alvarez got attention last year for his shockingly on-point version. TikToks riffing on an antipodean kids’ TV show called H2O: Just Add Water made the rounds a couple of years ago, making fun of how the performers pronounced one of the characters’ names: not Cleo, but Cleourrrrr. Advertisement  Suffice it to say, the algorithm was primed for further iterations. One of the earliest viral “naur” tweets was this, a proto-Joycean tragedy in miniature from 2020 about Iggy Azalea. “Iggy is in the house crying like naur....naur.... naur carti naur,” it reads. Like many online artifacts, it is almost impossible to understand without additional context. When I called its author, 24-year-old fashion consultant Chris Bridges, they said its popularity was “really random.” Bridges had dashed it off in the early hours of Christmas Day last year after seeing a tweet by the Australian rapper criticizing Playboi Carti for apparently choosing not to spend the holiday with their son. “I was just, like, bored in my house, trapped with my family. I really wanted to go out. So I was just on Twitter, drunk, tweeting,” Bridges said. “I tweeted it and I went to sleep. And I woke up the next day, and everyone was laughing.”Bridges wasn’t the first to popularize the spelling; they had seen it on Tumblr. Their tweet was a dig at Azalea and her accent, but they said they’d had some practice because of an Australian friend they like to rag on, albeit in a more loving way. “We make fun of her accent relentlessly,” they said. “Saying weird stuff she would say. I kind of got hooked on the way she would say ‘no,’ like, naur. It really sent me.”In June, Chicago-based comedian Seynique Smythe tweeted a photo of n, a, u, and r Scrabble tiles. When I DM'd Smythe to chat (“naur,” she responded at first, swiftly following up with “jk”), she said that the photo came from a real game she’d played. Her hand had made her “desperate” — when she saw the letters, she thought to herself, Can I play this? But the reason the meme had resonated at all was a pop culture reference. “I used to love the Australian show Saddle Club when I was a kid and I remember there was a character named Lisa who always said ‘no’ like that,” she said. “So when I first started seeing the meme around, it stood out because it was like, ‘OMG, other people have noticed this.’” Advertisement  
 


Typically, when people who aren’t Australian attempt the accent, they don’t do a very good job. This has resulted in horrid interpretations, like those in the “Bart vs. Australia” episode of The Simpsons and Robert Downey Jr.’s in Natural Born Killers.But the Australian accent isn’t uniform across the country. Sydney-based dialect coach Victoria Mielewska has worked with Kate Winslet, Liev Schreiber, and Elisabeth Moss on perfecting their Australian diction. “Australia is such a melting pot — there are so many different accents. It's hard to actually say [any] is the absolute one,” Mielewska said. But generally speaking, there are common elements that are difficult to imitate yet tempting to lampoon. As former director of the Australian National Dictionary Centre Bruce Moore laid out in the 2007 book Talking and Listening in the Age of Modernity, they include a nasal quality, flat intonation, and a drawl. Advertisement  “If you're British or American, a lot of your accent is based on musculature in the mouth,” Mielewska said. “They're very muscular accents. When you go into Australian, you really relax the tone and the soft palate. So it's actually asking [non-Australian] actors to undo what is inherent and habitual with their own accent. And that's why it's so hard ... you have to have a certain amount of vulnerability, and allow that exposure of this new accent to come through.”“Naur” is an unusual instance of non-Australians actually managing to sound Australian, albeit in an exaggerated way. So what accounts for the way Australians say “no”? Mielewska said the word actually “has a fairly tight musculature” compared to other Australian-accented words. To get “that unique Australian sound,” she said, the lips round toward the end of the word, and the tongue bulks up to make that “r” sound. Her tips for nailing it are to put “no” and “ur” together, stretching out the sounds, and not to stay on the same note throughout the word. “Be definitive about it,” she said.Crystal Abidin, an associate professor of internet studies at Perth’s Curtin University, said that online jokes about Australian accents have been around for much longer than, say, TikTok has. “[The letters] ‘n’ and ‘o’ becoming like a 12-letter ‘no’ was definitely one of the viral things I saw on Australian Tumblr from as early as 2008, 2009,” she told me. “But I would say the mainstreaming of Australian vernacular, in general, really took off internationally on Facebook pages.” One category of early Facebook memes compared Australia to other countries, usually in a self-deprecating way. “Like, ‘China has Phoenixes; we've got bin chickens.’” Advertisement  
 


The repository Know Your Meme recognized “naur” with its own entry in July 2021. According to Google Trends, “naur” hit its peak online in late September. While the accent jokes kept coming, “naur” began to be used on its own, as a cartoonish, emphasized version of “no.” How did it make the jump? As linguist Gretchen McCulloch puts it in her 2019 book Because Internet, a meme “isn’t just something popular, a video or image or phrase that goes viral. It’s something that’s remade and recombined, spreading as an atom of internet culture.”In this case, “naur” spread further still thanks to K-pop fans who noticed that stars like BlackPink member Rosé and Stray Kids’ Bang Chan and Felix, who all have Australian roots, pronounced it that way. “The ‘naur’ meme has received a lot of acknowledgment, reciprocity, and feedback from the K-pop stars themselves,” said Abidin, who added that BlackPink members have used it playfully with each other during interviews. All of this has the effect of entrenching it as part of the relationship between fandom and stars. “It absorbed into K-pop, transcended fandom, and is known by the stars too, which really has a major effect in disseminating the visibility of the meme to a larger, broader international audience as well.”Now, it basically seems to be an accepted word for Gen Z on TikTok and Twitter. That probably wasn’t an organic outcome, Abidin said. “It is often the case that on platforms, especially like Twitter, this kind of meme that has only a very niche social capital becomes a mainstay of the platform, even if nobody understands it. It goes out of its silo, takes on a life of its own, and it becomes ingrained as part of pop culture in general. And this has to do with K-pop fans strategically trying to groom algorithms into registering what they do as trends.”I’d dreamt up a theory, shoddily constructed around the cultural prevalence of Hemsworth brothers and K-pop stars like Rosé, that the accent was coming into its own. But maybe not. Unfortunately, it seemed like my accent had become part of the landscape not, as I’d hoped, because of some global agreement that the Australian accent was a mellifluous joy, heretofore unappreciated, but because 1) people were making fun of it and 2) there had likely been a concerted digital effort.Embarrassed about the wishful thinking, I figured that I was predisposed to think fondly of the meme mostly because I was an expat, nostalgically pining for the sounds I grew up with. But it had also seemed to mark some kind of change in how other people saw the Australian accent. It used to be the butt of the joke rather than something that could bring a bunch of different people together, and this was the first time I could remember non-Australians using it to communicate and laugh with me, rather than just wielding it at me.Were locals enjoying the gag as well? Abidin reminded me of the concept of “cultural cringe,” an all-Australian skepticism toward homegrown cultural products, which might well apply to a joke that made fun of the way most of us talk.But according to Michelle Rennex, a senior writer at Australian culture website Junkee and one of the first people to cover the “naur” meme, that wasn’t the case. “No Aussie is actually offended by anyone coming up to us and saying ‘naur,’” she told me via email. “The good thing about Australians is that we know how to take a joke.” Rennex said she loved the meme; her favorite iteration is this reference to the Saw movie franchise. “I often make my accent extra thick to get my point across. It’s common for Australians to make fun of the different types of Aussie accents. But while we might not all normally say naur in such a thick accent, there’s definitely a trace of naur in all of us.”Honestly, I love “naur.” It may seem bizarre to contemplate it so seriously, but I really do think about it all the time. Maybe that’s because it is so ridiculous, an utterance that instantly clears my brain and turns me into an Australian Girl Doll: no thoughts, just naur.Yet it’s obvious why this otherwise trivial meme has stuck with me all year. I live in New York and thanks to the various travel complications caused by COVID-19, I likely won’t see the Southern Hemisphere for some time. I’m homesick and grateful to have my national identity recognized and played with while I’m so far from home, even if it’s because of something as quotidian as the way I speak. “People enjoy listening to it, and people are fascinated by it,” Mielewska told me, before she said something that made me feel really happy and, well, heard. “It’s welcoming, it’s open, it’s personable. I think people really warm to the Australian accent a great deal.” ●

296,"Things that save you money, make you smile or look good, or just are fun? That’s a life hack, baby.","


Many days it seemed like just making it to the end of 2021 was the ultimate life hack. These are some of the tips that got the staff of BuzzFeed News through it. From the best place to buy jumpsuits (Old Navy, seriously), the Peloton coach that got us through it (Jess King), the sublime experience of keeping a dream journal, or just….

Peloton coach Jess KingThree days into my Peloton trial and about 10 minutes into a ride that was clearly way too difficult for me, I was seconds away from giving up. And then, I swear to you, at the very moment I was going to step off the bike the instructor, Jess King, looked me dead in the eyes and said something like “Don’t you DARE. Don’t you dare give up. You can do it.” I don’t know why, because I am typically cynical about things like feeling the person in a workout video stream is speaking to me, specifically, but I listened and stayed on the bike. And I did do it. And six or so minutes later, when King told me to lean to the right if I was going to puke, I did that, too. That was more than 50 pounds ago. And while diet and mindfulness had a lot to do with me getting healthy, so did Jess King. Because she kept me biking, daily. How did she do that to an older guy in the worst shape of his life? Distraction. With the exuberance of a trick-or-treating kid in their best costume ever or the happiest person at a rave, King is fantastically, endlessly distracting — with or without the live DJ that sometimes accompanies her. She rides the bike like it’s a horse and her steady stream of direction is encouraging and surrealistically instructive. “Pretend you have gills in your armpits!” “Nipples over knees.” “Breathe through your back.” “Oops, I meant add 5.” “Here comes the shitshift!” And, yes, “Puke to the left.” She is the only coach who consistently makes me forget about my own discomfort long enough to keep exercising regularly. And to be clear, the discomfort is real, because King is a very good trainer — she’s just giddy and comfortably ridiculous enough to distract you from it. —John Paczkowski Advertisement  
 


Getting rid of your carAfter I moved to LA, I acquired a collection of business cards and notes that people left under my windshield wipers or in the driver’s window that basically said, “hey your car is a dump, let me buy it.” Then I moved to a neighborhood notorious for having the worst possible street parking in the city, and my problems escalated. My catalytic converter was stolen. Then I paid a lot to replace it and cover other repairs. Then, about a month later, it was stolen again. Then I paid a lot to replace it again and cover more repairs. Then I installed an anti-theft mechanism, surrendered, and handed the keys over to my dad and let him drive away with it. Advertisement  I bought my bike for $200 on Craigslist a decade ago and have probably spent five times that much on upkeep since then, which is still a fraction of how much it cost to own a car. I’d already relied on my bike for most trips, and the car had become redundant. I was only moving it once a week to repark and avoid tickets on street-sweeping days.I figured ridding myself of this turbulent beast would simplify my life. And it has. Now everything I own on this planet is inside my little shoebox apartment. I immediately stopped paying for gas, for parking, for tickets, for oil changes, for brakes and tires and catalytic converters, for Geico, for the AAA membership, for the little sticker on the corner of the license plate. But it’s also made getting groceries a drag. And getting anywhere takes a little longer when you’re on bike and public transit. And I’m rolling up to dates with helmet hair and drenched in sweat. And, without a trunk or backseat to store things, I’ve had to embrace being a Backpack-Wearing Adult.It’s complicated things, but it’s simplified things. I’m tethered to the city, but I’m liberated. —Emerson Malone
 


Telfar medium shopping bag — $202 on Telfar (sold out, but $150–200 on Poshmark)The Telfar medium shopping bag is perfect. Many people have extolled Telfar’s virtues and you don’t need me to go into it here, but what I did not know was that the medium bag is the perfect size. It somehow fits absolutely everything I need for all possible situations: my laptop, my water bottle, the old Glossier bag I throw my toothbrush and face wash into when I go to my boyfriend’s place, the giant copy of Dune I for some reason take everywhere with me lately, a bunch of old disposable masks I forgot about — you name it. The handles and straps mean it can be worn or carried in a bunch of different ways without killing my shoulders and/or neck, and it somehow goes with everything I wear. I’ve never really been a purse girl, but I’ve been converted. I haven’t touched my ratty old tote bags once since this baby was delivered. —Addy Baird
 


Getting full coverage car insurance — $XX/month (varies obviously) from HagertyI purchased a classic car in full almost two years ago while we were all stuck at home and public transportation was frowned upon. When I first got it, I was in a rush to get it onto the road and only insured it for liability. In the back of my mind, I knew I should probably get better coverage but kept putting it off. A few months ago, the East Coast got hit with the tail end of Hurricane Ida and experienced extreme flash flooding. My car was supposed to be safe at my mechanic’s, but it turned out that his shop was in an area susceptible to flooding. Long story short, all of his and his customers’ expensive classic cars were destroyed — except for mine. My car just so happened to be on the lift that evening. I took that as a sign to get full coverage because I don’t think I’ll get that lucky ever again. I sleep much better at night knowing I’m covered for its full value if something were to happen to it. —Derek Gardner
 


Homefield Apparel shirts — $32 at Homefield ApparelNot that anyone needs to wear college-themed apparel any more than we already do here in the US of A, but Homefield Apparel has a lot of great retro or retro-appearing logos on T-shirts for a variety of colleges (including, for example, the Naval Academy, North Carolina A&T, and Rice — it’s not just Alabama and Michigan, you know?). The T-shirts themselves are not the sturdiest I’ve ever owned and will run you more like $30 a pop, but they look great and are extremely soft, and frequently the first I reach for when going for a T-shirt. These also fall squarely in the “good gift for sibling” territory, if your sibling is looking for, say, George Washington dribbling a basketball in a ’90s style, or the LSU tiger dunking one. It’s also semi-interesting to compare different schools and get a good sense for which are needlessly tight with what kinds of uses of their branding they’ll allow. —Katherine Miller
 


Old Navy jumpsuits — $30–44 at Old NavyI’m not ashamed to admit that I’m the person that’s usually two to three years behind the curve. So, it wasn’t until this year that I discovered I absolutely adore jumpsuits. My gateway outfit was a hand-me-down from my mother: a neon pink jumpsuit, covered in light pink starfish, that she bought on a family trip to Hawaii in the early 1990s. Since then I’ve gone all in on the fad, most recently buying a couple of styles from Old Navy as a self birthday present: the smocked cami jumpsuit for women in a leopard print and Breathe On cross-front sleeveless jumpsuit for women in purple. (Note that the patterns available are constantly changing.) It’s not uncommon for me to wear both of these, perhaps more than once, in a week. They are soft, flattering, and, of course, have pockets, making them the go-to outfit for walking my daughter to daycare, sitting at home in front of my computer, or meeting work colleagues for drinks at an outside bar. —Zahra Hirji
 


Keeping a dream diary — $24 for BuzzFeed News’s notebook from AppointedMost of my dreams are innocuous and forgettable; these are the ones where I’m reading Slack and scrolling through Twitter, and it hurts my feelings that this is the best my nocturnal imagination can do. But sometimes there are the surreal stream-of-consciousness ones that mold my entire day. Not just the ones where my molars are falling out, but the ones where I’m skateboarding around the White House and running through an unbelievably beautiful meadow and babysitting a gross alien creature. That’s why I started keeping a running doc in my Notes app simply titled “weird dreams lately,” dedicated to the more twisted yarns, which are always a genuine delight to revisit.Chuck Klosterman wrote, “People who talk about their dreams are actually trying to tell you things about themselves they'd never admit in normal conversation. It’s a way for people to be honest without telling the truth.” So if that’s the case, what do I do with these:Nov. 26: Woodward and Bernstein are standing arm in arm on an elevated platform in a nightclub and singing something to the effect of “I ain’t never seen two pretty best friends / It’s always one of them gotta be ugly.”Dec. 11: An earthquake. The foundation of my condo’s building was tipping dramatically toward the street. I was holding onto a table for balance. The cats, Puck and Toby, were freaking out. Puck was standing on his hind legs trying to grab the air with both paws. All we could do was laugh.Dec. 21: I was performing in a play at my middle school at my current age. All the actors started to go off script. I got too comfortable and said the word “motherfucker” and everybody went silent and stared at me.Feb. 2: Someone kept using the phrase “that’s like putting braces on a scorpion.”Feb. 19: Dad and I visited a space museum run and operated by Mike Myers. We watched a video about efforts to extract petroleum on Mars and the voiceover sounded a lot like Dad. He wouldn’t admit that it was him. I asked Mike Myers who did the voiceover and he said it was Dad. —Emerson Malone
 


PigletsOut of all my attempts at mid-pandemic rejuvenation and despair mitigation, visiting a local farm with a bunch of piglets was by far the most effective. Piglets are a lot like puppies in that they are small, cuddly, and curious. But because they are pigs, they are arguably better. Their diminutive grunts and oinks? Their pristinely pink little noses and tiny ever-spinning tails? How ferociously, soothingly adorable. And how gently they pluck a piece of apple from your fingertips! It’s sort of the pig equivalent of a friend’s baby holding your finger. All this stuff makes a visit with piglets a killer pandemic poultice, an experience that will leave you giggling and obliterated for at least a few hours of the 18 months of the miasma of horror, idiocy, and anger we’ve all been living through. —John Paczkowski
 


Fabric face masks — $32 at BagguI struggled for so long to find a mask that not only fit my face but felt cute! These masks have a flap that covers your mouth, chin, and nose so they’re great for glasses wearers, too. I get so many compliments when I wear these! —Nicole Fallert
 


CheekfaceYou know those TV episodes where the plot can’t be resolved because one catastrophe leads to another? It feels like we’ve been stuck in one of those for half a decade, with the finale being isolation from friends and family for almost two years (The dumpster fire got bigger, now we need a bigger dumpster and a book of matches). But with the pandemic easing, I've been trying to get back to being human, and what's been helping me do that is the band Cheekface. (Here, let me explain how breathing works: You suck in and you continue to live).The LA-based trio of Greg Katz, Amanda Tannen, and Mark “Echo” Edwards specialize in tight, talk-sung indie tunes of wry hopelessness and hopeful wryness (It’s your best life if it’s the life that you’re living right now). With their two LPs (2019’s Therapy Island and 2021’s Emphatically No) and a smattering of singles, covers, and B-sides, they balance the boredom of living while the world burns and the joy of simply existing (Sometimes I wonder if there's a single good thing on earth. And then I eat Cinnamon Toast Crunch.). Advertisement     In early October, I was in a (masked, vaccinated) crowd indoors for the first time since the pandemic started, to catch Cheekface when they swung through NYC. It was a needed, personal reminder that crowds don’t have to be a threat. They can be a balm. (I liked it better when you were standing next to me.) —Brandon Hardin
 


Tarot cards — $17 at AmazonOne of the joys introduced to me this year was a new deck of tarot cards I received as a gift from a good friend. We sat on her sofa and each thought of something going on in our lives, drew a card, looked up its meaning, and thought intently about what it reflected about our personal state of affairs. We’ve all just quietly gone through so much in the pandemic. The answers, of course, lay in our interpretations, and the tarot cards can be a vehicle for self-reflection more than anything else. As we come out of a year spent in partial isolation, it was just more fun to do it with an old friend, laughing together and cheering on each other’s realizations made through a beautiful deck of divination cards. The answers we seek all lie in us anyhow, we just need some help getting to them, and a reminder that we’re not alone. —Venessa Wong Advertisement     
 


Used furniture from AuctionNinja.comAuctionNinja is an online estate sale auction site. It’s kind of like eBay, but with items grouped by individual estate sales, so typically a whole house’s worth of furniture and or other belongings. It’s a massive pain to buy stuff there, because you have to pick it up — in person — at a specific time window at the actual house over that weekend, or you forfeit payment! But because it’s such a pain, the prices…. My god, the prices.... They are just sublime. Advertisement     I moved this summer and needed some new furniture. My personal style has always been for vintage or thrift stuff, and with the supply chain issues happening I was hearing horror stories from friends waiting months for a West Elm couch to arrive. I paid under $1,000 for two matching couches in great condition from a fancy home in Greenwich, Connecticut (a friend helped load and move them). This is a site I almost hesitate to recommend because I don’t want too many people to find out about it and jack up the prices. It’s an amazing bridge between the random stuff on Facebook Marketplace/ Craigslist and a curated antique shop. —Katie NotopoulosOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News
"
298,The newest Marvel movie had one of the biggest opening weekends in history. Does it live up to the hype? (Spoilers ahead.),"


The smashing success of Marvel’s latest superhero vehicle, Spider-Man: No Way Home, had two of our critics curious: Is it actually any good?Turns out, they vehemently disagreed. But sometimes that’s more fun, right?Below, Shannon Keating and Elamin Abdelmahmoud hash it all out: Is Tom Holland’s Homecoming trilogy a welcome expansion upon the existing Spidey-verse, or just a depressing cash grab? What can millennial nostalgia tell us about the Tobey Maguire–helmed series, which kicked off nearly 20 years ago? Does the deployment of the multiverse in No Way Home actually make any sense? And, finally, should you see it? Advertisement     Elamin Abdelmahmoud: In Toronto, where I live, new COVID restrictions due to the spread of Omicron require movie theaters to refrain from selling popcorn, candy, and drinks. Which is to say: They require movie theaters to refrain from selling joy. So what would make anyone go to the theater under such unfulfilling conditions? This weekend, the answer was Spider-Man: No Way Home. Audiences turned up in droves for the movie, helping it pull in the third-biggest opening weekend of all time worldwide, and the second-biggest of all time in the US. That’s not a pandemic-era record. It’s an all-time record. I was among these people. I put on a fresh KN95 and settled in for what I was sure would be a lesser movie experience. But it was not.No Way Home, reportedly the conclusion of Tom Holland’s tenure as Spider-Man (or…is it?), is one of the most satisfying entries into the franchise, perhaps second only to Into the Spiderverse. That’s because of its sheer scale and ambitious plot — in No Way Home, Holland’s Peter Parker attempts to fix the consequences of his actions through a time spell from Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), but his plan goes terribly wrong when the spell becomes unstable and starts pulling in Peter Parkers/Spider-Men from alternate universes (aka Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man and Andrew Garfield’s Spider-Man) and all the villains they’ve fought, too.Describing a film as “satisfying” can read like shorthand for “fan service,” which has become a lazy way for franchises with big, passionate fandoms to elicit excitement without putting in the effort to write films that offer something unique. No Way Home does deliver big fan-servicey moments — when Garfield showed up, there were audible gasps in the theater — but the devastating emotional center of the film makes it far more than a simple play on nostalgia.In this iteration, after Holland’s Peter suffers a catastrophic loss, the multiverse Spider-Men show up not just to help him on his quest but to redeem themselves, too. By the time we meet Maguire’s Peter, he’s a Spider-Elder who has reckoned with his Spider-Doubts and found purpose. Meanwhile, Garfield’s Peter is rudderless and lonely, having lost himself in his Spider-Duties. These two Spider-Men share touching moments (“No, you are amazing, and I need to hear you say it,” Maguire’s Peter says to Garfield’s; Garfield’s Peter can’t quite get there, but he’s overwhelmed with gratitude to be seen). Together, all three Peters unite to resolve the central question that the previous movies have been circling but not quite answering, which is: What is Spider-Man for? Ultimately, the answer is a poignant and simple one: to help us understand and better deal with grief. That’s why No Way Home is good, actually. Shannon, what do you think? Advertisement     Shannon Keating: Totally agree that Spider-Man is about understanding and dealing with grief! But I’m not sure I agree about how well No Way Home deals with those themes.After watching No Way Home this weekend (in Mexico City, where COVID cases are currently decreasing), I went home and binged the three Tobey Maguire iterations. The first, Spider-Man, came out in 2002 (!!!!) when I was 10 years old. Almost 20 years ago. Wild. Those movies are obviously big millennial touchpoints; Maguire will always be my Spider-Man, I think. There’s a certain grittiness to the trilogy that I appreciated even as a kid.Spidey’s origin story is a dark one, but before my rewatches, I had forgotten just how dark. In Spider-Man, when Peter holds his murdered Uncle Ben’s hand, it’s not a beautiful or poetic moment; Ben is grimacing with pain and anguish. It’s pretty horrible. Then we have all of James Franco’s daddy issues with the incredible Willem Dafoe — my introduction to both actors were their roles as Green Goblin and son Harry Osborn — and the unhealthy and eventually murderous ways Harry channels his confusion and his grief.The Maguire movies are also lovely tributes to New York City. Spider-Man doesn’t just save New Yorkers; New Yorkers have his back, too. In the first movie, a proud and rowdy group rains detritus upon the Green Goblin when he’s trying to kill Kirsten Dunst’s Mary Jane and a cable car full of people, one of them yelling, “You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!” In Spider-Man 2, after Spider-Man stops Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) from plunging a subway train into the river, he passes out from exhaustion and the passengers gently lift him into their arms, set him down, and promise not to reveal his identity — his mask had come off during the fight.This is all to say that I didn’t get a lot of those big, emotional beats from No Way Home, even with that one significant and sad death. I’m sure my millennial nostalgia is a part of that — an unwillingness to accept this new version of an old, beloved character. But I don’t know, man. Advertisement     First off, No Way Home is just…doing a lot. The multiverse is a fun concept, and it’s cute to see all these different Spider-Men united in brotherhood, but I think I preferred it when Spider-Man hewed closer to that gritty New York realism. No Way Home, though it does have its darkness, feels very Disney: shiny, wholesome, sexless.
 


This could just be a me problem, but the logic of the movie also escaped me. When Holland’s Spider-Man is trying to rehabilitate the villains from other worlds, I couldn’t stop thinking: Why are you making gigantic, fundamental changes to universes that are not your own??? We all know how tweaking things in time and/or space can have disastrous consequences! What’s going to happen when these men who were supposed to have died go home and are alive and, I guess, also nice now? Holland’s Spider-Man says multiple times throughout the movie that these guys are not his problem, which we are supposed to judge as callousness, because his Aunt May and the movie overall insist that they should be his problem. But why exactly is that the case, especially when the other Spider-Men have already dealt with them sufficiently back at home? I guess it’s a bummer that they had to die in their original universes, but as Dr. Strange says, that’s their fate. Leave the complications of other universes alone!That brings me to my confusion about what the movie is trying to say about being a good person, which I’d love your thoughts on, Elamin. I found it pretty goofy on both a thematic and practical, logistical level that all the Spider-Men could create perfectly calibrated antidotes that would turn their respective villains back into regular men, at which point they would seemingly be worthy of redemption. While I appreciate that idea, and would be very interested to see more superhero movies take on ideas around justice and restitution — especially if we have to live in a world where most movies are superhero movies, ugh — I felt like No Way Home handled it all so clunkily. Advertisement     Something I admired about 2002’s Spider-Man is that the Green Goblin wasn’t evil just because he accidentally zapped himself with jacked-up superpower juice or whatever. Norman Osborn was already a power-hungry capitalist, making oodles of money by providing the military with horrifying weapons of mass destruction. He was also an asshole patriarch who was sexist toward Mary Jane and emotionally tortured his son, which in turn led to Harry’s own descent into supervillainy. This is a bad guy! Who dies, remember, in a botched attempt to murder Peter.Not to say that Norman isn’t deserving of restorative justice — I think we all are, supervillains included — but still, it felt pretty reductive to erase these specificities in favor of promoting the idea that all the bad guys were only or mostly bad because of the way they acquired special powers. Superhero movies work best when they’re allegories for our real-life structural problems, and No Way Home’s kumbaya approach felt kinda basic and bogus to me. I know this is a movie for children, but still!EA: OK, not only is it a movie for children, it’s also a movie about children — I’m really compelled by the way that Holland plays the idealism of Peter. His “I can fix it” attitude, his desire to just resolve the matter in the simplest way (“Let’s just make the bad guys good!”) is the most kiddish thing about him, and that’s what drew me in. In his world, he’s trying to apply the morality lessons of helping everyone, and he immediately realizes he can do that with the technological tools he has access to — tools that perhaps the other Spider-Fellas didn’t. And what’s more, they work. He’s seen evidence of this. Changes to other multiverses be damned, there’s good to be done here!That’s not to say this viewpoint isn’t challenged — he suffers some serious consequences for trying to maintain his little-kid attitude and his Pollyannaish energy, and he’s faced with a personal crisis. I mean, Holland is ready to kill in this film, before the Spider-Elders offer their perspectives and bring him back from the edge. Advertisement     What unites all the Peters is that moment where they rally around the idea of great power/great responsibility. They realize they all have this in common, but it applies differently in each of their lives: Maguire realizes that his angst over the responsibility that he’s been given is not for nothing; Garfield concludes that he is his Spider-Brothers’ keeper; and Holland realizes that there is a cost to his idealism, but it is worth preserving.One thing that I think is elegant about this film is the way it handily settles the debate between who is the “best” Spider-Man by saying: Actually, all of them deal with different tragedies, and you can’t compare them but you can resolve them, so each finds some closure.SK: You’re totally right that Holland’s can-do Peter feels appropriate, especially due to his age! As much as I didn’t love this movie, I am a little bummed that Holland’s time as Spider-Man is allegedly coming to an end — I’m genuinely curious to see how his idealism would evolve over time.The Spider-Elders hyping each other was obviously fan service, in a way that probably would have delighted me more if I were more of a real fan, as opposed to someone who isn’t that attuned to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But I do really like that idea, Elamin — that this movie is weighing in on the debate about who’s “best” by sharing the love.OK, OK, I’m starting to give the movie more credit than I did initially. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend people who aren’t MCU fans drop into this one — especially in our era of Omicron — but catch it on an airplane in a few years? For sure. ●

President Joe Biden once again urged Americans to get vaccinated and condemned anti-vax misinformation on Tuesday afternoon, as the Omicron variant of COVID-19 spreads rapidly ahead of the holidays.The president said that unvaccinated people have “good reason to be concerned,” while those who are vaccinated and boosted are far less likely to be hospitalized or become seriously ill.While telling vaccinated Americans that they should not panic, Biden addressed the 70.6 million Americans who are completely unvaccinated on Tuesday in strong terms, telling them that their choice not to get the shots “can be the difference between life or death” for anyone they have contact with. Advertisement     “Your choice is not just about you. Your choice affects other people. You're putting other people at risk, the loved ones, or friends, neighbors, strangers you run into. Your choice can be the difference between life or death. The longer the virus is around the more likely the variants from that may be deadlier than the ones before.”Biden also directly cited former president Donald Trump, who told supporters on Monday that he has had a booster shot of the vaccine, despite having driven anti-science rhetoric and downplaying the pandemic during and after his time in office.""I got my booster shot as soon as they were available, and just today former president Trump announced he had gotten his booster shot. Maybe one of the few things he and I agree on.""The White House’s plan to contend with the crisis involves increasing federal support for overrun hospitals, making testing more accessible to Americans, and increasing vaccination resources.Biden went on to blast the spread of misinformation on social media and conservative cable television, where anti-vax rhetoric has thrived throughout the pandemic.“Look, the unvaccinated are responsible for their own choices. But those choices have been fueled by dangerous misinformation on cable TV and social media,” he said. “You know these companies and personalities are making money peddling lies, and all that misinformation that can kill their own customers and their own supporters. It's wrong. It's immoral. I call on the purveyors of these lies and misinformation to stop it. Stop it now.”Biden said 1,000 military medical personnel will be deployed to help hospitals around the country cope with an increase of COVID-19 patients, and that hundreds of ambulances and staff will be available to transport people from overcrowded hospitals to medical facilities with open beds.“I don’t think anybody anticipated that this was going to be as rapidly spreading as it did,” Biden said, responding to a question on Tuesday about whether the government failed to prepare for how quickly demand for tests has increased in recent days.The federal government has purchased 500 million at-home rapid tests, which people will be able to order online starting in January, the president said, in addition to the 50 million they announced earlier in December as part of their pre-Omicron winter plan. Federally run testing sites will also be set up, starting in New York City this week, and expanded to other parts of the country where local health authorities request assistance. Advertisement     Biden plans to continue using the Defense Production Act to assist manufacturers in producing COVID-19 tests to keep up with demand.“We should all be concerned about Omicron, but not panicked,” Biden said in his speech.“The best thing to do is to get fully vaccinated and get your booster shot,” he said. “And no, this is not March of 2020. Two hundred million people are fully vaccinated. We’re prepared. We know more.”

KYIV — Falling snow clouded Marta Yuzkiv’s line of sight as she moved in formation with seven other fighters down a narrow road. Rifles at the ready and communicating with hand signals and whispers, they scanned their surroundings for the enemy stalking them in the nearby bushes.Then, without warning, an ambush came from behind the pine trees. A Russian team of saboteurs gunned down four of Yuzkiv’s comrades. She dropped to the ground. But within seconds, she was shot and killed, too. Advertisement     The fighters weren’t actually dead. The ambush was part of a series of war games held Saturday — on the grounds of an abandoned factory outside Kyiv — by veteran instructors overseeing a ragtag group of Ukrainian volunteers.Russia is massing some 100,000 troops and military equipment around Ukraine, possibly mobilizing 75,000 reservists to join them, and threatening its neighbor with another large-scale attack unless the Kremlin’s demands for the US and NATO to abandon support for Kyiv are met. And fighters like Yuzkiv fear they could soon find themselves engaged in guerrilla warfare with highly trained soldiers under Moscow’s command.“I know for sure that I will not leave Ukraine [if Russia invades]. I will not live under occupation. I will resist,” Yuzkiv, a 51-year-old doctor, wife, and mother of three who prefers gardening to unconventional warfare training, told BuzzFeed News. “I am a compassionate, empathetic person, but…” After taking a beat, she finished: “I would kill [to protect my country].”
 


The war games involving civilian volunteers demonstrate the lengths to which Ukrainians are prepared to go if President Vladimir Putin decides to attack. Such a move would be an attempt to alter the country’s increasing alliance with the West and could spark a land war of the likes not seen in Europe since 1945. A poll done this month by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that more than 50% of Ukrainians — some 20 million of them — are ready to resist in one way or another if Russia launches a new invasion, while more than 33%, or roughly 13 million people, would be willing to join in armed resistance.Thousands — from Kharkiv in the east to Lviv in the west — in recent months have joined the forces, which are composed of about 80,000 volunteers in 25 separate brigades, or one for every region of Ukraine as well as the country’s capital city. They gather to train one day each weekend.The fighters are civilians from all walks of Ukrainian society, including IT workers, bankers, doctors, taxi drivers, schoolteachers, shopkeepers, and more. They don hunting attire and mismatching uniforms from army surplus stores. Some of them wear sneakers better fit for the fashionable streets of downtown Kyiv than the battlefield. And not everyone has a working rifle. In fact, several wielded cardboard cutouts of Kalashnikovs at Saturday’s training.Technically, the forces fall under the command of the Ukrainian military, essentially making them part of the country’s reserve army. But that doesn’t mean the military provides them garb and gear, although officials have suggested that defense force troops could eventually be given arms from the country’s stockpile. For now, they are forced to purchase everything on their own.But what they lack in equipment, they make up for in determination.
 


Dmytro Ternovskiy, a 39-year-old physical therapist for the Kyiv Arsenal soccer club, is originally from eastern Donetsk but fled the Russia-controlled city for Kyiv in 2016. He told BuzzFeed News that he had seen firsthand how Russian warlords seized his city and brought death and despair to residents there. He joined the territorial defense force to help make sure the same doesn’t happen to Kyiv and because he was ashamed that he didn’t take up arms to fight off the Russians in 2014.“It was very embarrassing that I was not with [Ukrainian fighters] then,” he said.Ternovskiy is trying to make up for that mistake. He’s already spent nearly $4,000 USD on uniforms, a bulletproof vest, boots, an assault rifle, cartridges, ammunition, and shooting practice.Vasyl Hryhoryuk, a 28-year-old entrepreneur, has him beat. He said he’s put more than $10,000 into his own fighting kit, which includes an AR-15 assault rifle and a Zbroyar Ukrainian-made sniper rifle. “If the dudes come from [Russia] and try to tell me how to live on my land, fuck them,” Hryhoryuk said with an air of bravado as he showed off his AR-15.Hryhoryuk goes to a shooting range once a week and CrossFit and stretching courses twice a week. Every Saturday, he shows up at the abandoned factory grounds to train with his fellow defense force fighters in Kyiv.Hryhoryuk has some past military training; he was conscripted into the Ukrainian army in 2011, at a time when it was “wildly underfunded.”“Things are different now, These are professionals,” he said of Ukrainian soldiers. He hopes the defense forces will soon be as prepared and lethal.The Biden administration, NATO officials, and the central government in Kyiv have all said they don’t know whether Putin has made a decision to invade Ukraine for a second time since 2014. But the increasingly ominous messaging from Moscow has them all on edge. Intelligence has suggested that an attack could come in late January or early February when tanks would be able to roll quickly over frozen ground. Advertisement     In recent days, Russian officials have warned that Moscow will respond “militarily” if the US and NATO don’t back out of Eastern Europe and pull support for Ukraine — which officials in Washington and Brussels have said will not happen. On Tuesday, Putin clearly delivered that threat himself.“If our Western colleagues continue the obviously aggressive stance, we will take appropriate retaliatory military-technical measures and react harshly to unfriendly steps,” he told Defense Ministry officials in Moscow. “Do they think we’re going to stand by and watch?”President Joe Biden as well as the UK and other NATO countries have either said explicitly or implied that they would not deploy forces to Ukraine if Russia invaded. Instead, as a senior Biden administration official told reporters Friday, they are prepared to enact “economic and financial measures, and we are prepared to consider a number of things that we have not considered in the past, and the results will be very profound on the Russian Federation, but I’m not going to go into details.”Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he wishes the US would be more explicit in what it’s willing to do so Kyiv would be better positioned to defend itself if an invasion came to pass.
 


“We know how to fight this war. Our soldiers have been fighting it for seven years,” Kuleba told BuzzFeed News in an interview last Tuesday. “But what our American and other partners can do is help Ukrainian soldiers fight this war. Which is strengthening our capabilities, supplying us with respective defensive weapons and military technologies now.” Advertisement     Specifically, he named American air defense and anti-missile systems as items topping Kyiv’s wish list.Ukraine’s army was demoralized and in miserable shape after decades of neglect when Russia invaded here in 2014. The country of roughly 40 million people had only an estimated 6,000 battle-ready troops. Volunteer battalions backed by oligarchs and crowdfunded by civilians filled the void but couldn’t completely repel the more powerful Russia-backed separatist forces.Today, Russia continues to occupy Crimea and control a swath of territory in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which are combined about the size of New Jersey. Separating them from the rest of Ukraine is a 250-mile maze of trenches and bunkers from which the Ukrainian military and Russian-backed separatists wage a war of attrition that has killed more than 14,000 people since spring 2014.After years of Western help, Ukraine’s army is now one of the largest in Europe, boasting 255,000 active-duty soldiers, 900,000 reservists, and some 90,000 paramilitary members. Washington has provided $2.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine’s military over the past seven years, according to the White House. Among the types of assistance are Javelin anti-tank missiles, Humvees, communication systems, and counter-battery radars, as well as military training.But Ukraine’s army is still not strong and experienced enough to defeat Russia if Putin unleashes the might of his military, which has over 1 million active-duty personnel and powerful ground, navy, and air forces, analysts say.As part of its preparation efforts, Kyiv is testing air-raid sirens in the capital this week and reviving many of its nearly 5,000 bomb shelters, which include its central metro stations that were built on the orders of the Soviet leadership in the wake of World War II hundreds of feet underground. (The city also published a map showing the location of the shelters inside schools, spas, bars, residential buildings, and elsewhere.) The facilities could hold more than 2 million of the more than 4 million Kyiv-area residents for several days — but not long term.Ukrainian news outlets have published stories about packing survival bags. The independent Hromadske news site painted a scenario for readers in which “the Ukrainian armed forces are resisting, but the Russians are using aircraft, rocket-propelled grenades and [other heavy weapons]. The front line is rapidly approaching your city… What to do in such circumstances?” Advertisement     Stick tape to the window of your home to protect against flying shards of glass during artillery attacks, it said. And gather personal documents, cash, medications, as well as supplies, like bottled water, nonperishable food times, matches, batteries, flashlights, an ax, condoms, and more.And then there are the Territorial Defense Forces, made up of motivated and patriotic Ukrainians like Yuzkiv, as well her husband and oldest son.Training the fighters are some of Ukraine’s more experienced veterans. Among them is Serhiy Filippov, 60, who went by the call sign “Sedoy,” meaning “gray,” for the silvery locks that frame his grizzled face. He was a major in the Donbas Battalion, a volunteer fighting force that helped turn the Russian-backed separatist tide in 2014 and 2015.
 


“These guys are motivated. They come to learn and they are ready to be the first to die for this city,” Filippov said.

Fiction
 


That So died so young and suddenly certainly adds to the eerie sense of promise and potential in his posthumous debut collection, but rest assured, So knew he was going to be a star and this collection proves it. From the first story about two sisters working at a donut shop and speculating on the customer who comes in late at night to a virtuosic screenplay rendering of a family wedding with secrets unearthed to the gut-wrenching final story based on So’s mother’s family history — the writing is electric and original. —Tomi Obaro
 


Those familiar with Rooney’s last two books, Normal People and Conversations with Friends — both since adapted for the screen, and both hailed as landmarks of millennial fiction (whatever that really is) — will find more classic Rooneyisms in Beautiful World: deceptively simple sentences that are a real pleasure to read, skinny, pale, and brooding characters figuring out adulthood in modern Ireland. This time, we meet Alice, a young Irish novelist, whose long emails exchanged with best friend Eileen reflect her anxieties and ambivalences about literary fame, modern culture, impending social collapse, and the role of religion in their lives.These emails, placed interstitially as chapters throughout the novel — which is otherwise written in a distant third person — are the only times we can really get in these womens’ heads. To some readers (at least, some of the friends I’ve had feverish debriefs with after we devoured the book), the emails are self-indulgent drags; I know at least two people who skimmed them. But I found the letters, loving exchanges between friends with (in typical Rooney fashion) major class differences and positionalities, to be lovely, moving, and even profound.To the extent the book is “about” anything, both Alice and Eileen have love interests; to me, though, they’re the least interesting bits. I loved spending time in Rooney’s characters’ heads — they’re frustrating and funny, petty and loving, fallible and human. —Shannon Keating Advertisement     
 


Though Swamy’s debut novel examines the lack of agency for mothers in 1960s and '70s Bombay — her protagonist’s struggles are equally relevant today. Vidya’s young life is defined by her mother’s mental illness and eventual suicide. Vidya’s mother was deeply unhappy with motherhood and the ways in which society controls women’s actions. After her mother’s death, Vidya vows never to have children and to devote herself to Kathak dancing instead. Dance feels like breathing for Vidya, but when she becomes pregnant later in the novel, she struggles with how to balance her art with motherhood. Swamy’s immersive and vivid writing comes across beautifully in Sneha Mathan’s narration of the audiobook. —Margaret Kingsbury Advertisement     
 


This novel follows a 9-year-old Syrian boy, Amir, who has washed up as the sole survivor of a refugee boat that sank near a small island. He’s rescued by Vӓnna, a local teenage girl, who seems to feel her own kind of displacement even at home. The chapters alternate between Amir’s life before getting to the island and the journey he and Vӓnna take toward safety. In a little more than 250 pages, El Akkad manages to write a book about family, masculinity, migration, language, humanity (or a lack thereof), and innocence. Every word feels essential, and every chapter is quietly devastating until you reach the novel’s conclusion, a chapter that I’m confident every reader will remember for the rest of their lives. The story is brutal but compassionate, one that humanizes migrants so often stripped of their humanity as soon as they become “migrants.” Advertisement     El Akkad is infuriating because his prose is perfect, and his characters are more vivid than some people I know in real life. It’s devastating and, at times, hopeful, and even when his characters act without compassion, El Akkad always rights the ship back toward tenderness. What Strange Paradise cements El Akkad as one of the best writers alive today: clairvoyant, heartbreaking, and exceptional. —Scaachi Koul
 


Although it’s been classified as historical fiction, when it comes down to the heart and soul of this beautifully written debut novel by Robert Jones Jr., it's a love story at its core. Jones explores the forbidden romance between two enslaved boys — Isaiah and Samuel — in the Deep South, who find solace and safety in one another, despite their circumstances and the negative forces trying to tear them apart. Darkness becomes their best friend — the only time when they feel secure enough to strip away from their reality and come together as one. Told from multiple perspectives, Jones seamlessly intertwines names and themes from the Bible with the merciless treatment of enslaved people to bring readers a story that’s equally uncomfortable as it is alluring. The multiple narratives can feel a little overwhelming at first, but it quickly becomes clear how these vivid characters and their various perspectives illuminate this tale. I appreciate how honest Jones is with his writing, because even during those graphic moments where I would’ve preferred to shield my eyes from the atrocities Isaiah and Samuel were subjected to, I ultimately knew how important it was for these truths to be told. It’s a powerful telling of a resilient love that will leave you starving for more. —Morgan Murrell Advertisement     
 


I nearly didn’t finish this book. Not because I found fault with the writing — Lockwood is a brilliant, hilarious, and truly original writer. But in mid-2021, when I first picked it up, I was interested in escaping the increasingly dystopian internet landscape, and I wasn’t sure if a fictionalized account of a woman achieving social media fame in something deemed “the portal” would offer me the kind of escapism I craved. Indeed, in the first half of the book, Lockwood’s narrator sinks further into the portal’s bizarro world of endless jokes and strange images as a dictator takes over and climate collapse looms. A little too on the nose for me! Advertisement     But just when I was about to set the book aside, something changed. The narrator receives two texts from her mother, asking her to come home — something has gone wrong with her sister’s pregnancy.What unfolds throughout the rest of the novel is nothing short of astonishing. Lockwood has fictionalized a true tragedy from her own family’s life, and the way she imbues her irony-pilled narrator with an ever-greater knowledge of what is good and right in true in an increasingly dark and chaotic world frequently brought me to tears. I’ve never read anything like it. —Shannon Keating
 


The poignant and poetic vignettes that comprise Somebody Loves You are at first startling in their interplay between fantasy and reality, but while Ruby’s child perspective may lend itself to the whimsical at times — and especially in the beginning — her narrative is steeped in the reality and traumas of life as a South Asian girl in England. When Ruby begins elementary school, she chooses to become silent, observing the world instead of letting her voice impact it. In Ruby’s small day-to-day observances, the reader sees a mother’s mental illness unfold, the devastating impact of a neighbor’s racism, and the fraught bond between sisters unravel and weave back together again. Lovely, funny, and heartbreaking, this liminal glimpse into a child’s life is unforgettable. —M.K. Advertisement     
 


In what might be a queasy premise in the hands of a less capable writer, Peters tackles the bogeyman of detransitioning and queer parenting in this thoughtful novel about an unconventional trio. Reese is a trans woman in her mid-30s who wants to become a mother and is feeling somewhat rudderless in a series of dead-end jobs with dead-end boyfriends. Ames, formerly known as Amy before he detransitioned, has just gotten his boss, Katrina pregnant. He reaches out to Reese, whom he dated before he detransitioned, to see if she might be interested in coparenting. It’s a premise that feels a little unbelievable, but it’s really a way for Peters to dig into the backstories of Ames and Reese, their relationships to themselves and their gender identity. Peters is so observant and shrewd about race, class, and intersectionality; she writes movingly about the ways sex can be used to disassociate. It’s a book I spent a long time thinking about after I read it. —T.O. Advertisement     
 


When an apothecary begins to secretly dispense poisons to help liberate other women who have been wronged by the men in their lives, things take a turn for the worse — that was the short synopsis I read about this book before officially diving in and it had me hooked! Once I actually cracked it open, it didn’t take long for me to become completely enthralled. Penner takes readers on an unforgettable adventure, traveling through time between the dark alleys of 18th-century London with Nella and her hidden apothecary shop to modern-day London with aspiring historian Caroline, who stumbles upon one of Nella’s old vials. While the story initially presents itself as a murder mystery, once you peel back the layers, it quickly unfolds into a tale of women reclaiming their agency and their sense of self. It was amazing to see women protagonists learning to put themselves first, despite the people they would have to leave behind in the process. The way the author weaves together the intricate historical details, while also remaining true to the social norms of those time periods, does not go unnoticed. The writing was compelling, fun, and with just the right amount of imagination to keep me engaged from beginning to end. —M.M.
 


It seems odd to call a book delightful when it tackles such decidedly undelightful topics: the pandemic, a ghost haunting, an indigenous woman wrongfully accused of a crime and sentenced to 60 years in prison, police brutality, the entire year of 2020. Yet this novel, with its spiky yet warm main character and homage to the world of bookselling and reading, is an utterly delightful read that doesn't shy away from 2020's misery and uncertainty. Much of the novel takes place in author Louise Erdrich's bookstore, Birchbark Books. When Tookie is released from prison after a much shorter sentence than she originally received, she begins working in the bookstore. She also reunites with the man who arrested her and the two marry. Shortly before the pandemic, a frequent customer, Flora, dies and begins haunting the bookstore, particularly Tookie. Flora was the kind of white woman who longed to be indigenous and frequently invented ties to the indigenous community, although she also donated to the community. At first, her ghost is content to wander amongst the shelves, idly flipping through books, but when the pandemic hits, the ghost becomes more sinister. Sentences in multiple forms play an essential role in the novel, from prison sentences to favorite sentences from books. While the novel does meander from its ghostly plot, the bookish odes and conversations, as well as Tookie's family life, are such a joy to read that the reader will hardly mind. The novel is likely to become the book to read about the pandemic. —M.K. (From ""25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down"")
 


In 2015’s The Sympathizer, Nguyen’s Pulitzer Prize–winning debut novel, an unnamed spy documents the hypocrisies of the Vietnam War from his unique vantage point as a half-French, half-Vietnamese double agent. He’s embedded in a South Vietnamese operation based in California, while secretly working on behalf of the Communist North Vietnamese. After surviving torture in a reeducation camp, the spy sets sail for France on a refugee boat with Bon, one of his best friends and fellow South Vietnamese soldier, who doesn’t know about the spy’s Communist past.And that’s where The Committed picks up, as our unnamed protagonist joins Bon in a seedy drug-selling operation. In his spare time, he reads theorists like Fanon. Part action-packed thriller, part trenchant critique on myriad evils of imperialism, The Committed is an incisive and thought-provoking read. —T.O.
 


Mina, a physician who grew up in Beirut and is the trans daughter of a Syrian mother and Lebanese father, receives an invitation from a nurse friend to come to Lesbos to offer her medical and translation services. Her brother Mezan, the only member of her family she still speaks to, will meet her there as well.Written in short chapters and addressed to an unnamed acquaintance who, like Alameddine, is a gay Lebanese writer, Mina oscillates between her own memories: meeting her wife, Francine, her decadeslong estrangement from her family, and the stories of refugees on Lesbos. She meets a Syrian family whose wife and mother, Sumaiya, has advanced cancer and doesn’t want her children to know. Mina watches venal white volunteers ask for selfies and European journalists make racist assumptions about the people they interview. The refugee crisis has become the kind of slowly unfolding calamity that can invite a lot of overwrought trauma porn; Alameddine resists that temptation here, opting for nuanced and insightful reflections on ordinary people trapped in horrific circumstances often caused by the countries whose asylum they now seek. —T.O.

Like the best of Toews’ novels, Fight Night deals with weighty subjects — suicide, aging, illness, and mortality — with a keen sense of humor. Swiv, a spunky 9-year-old who has been suspended from school, writes letters to her absent father. The letters are mostly about her grandma, a chronically ill firecracker who loves to rile her daughter, Swiv’s mother, who is a struggling actor pregnant with a baby they’ve all dubbed Gord. When Swiv and her grandmother leave their Toronto apartment to visit relatives in Fresno, California, Swiv learns more about her family’s true fighting spirit. Like Toews herself, Swiv comes from a family of Mennonites, a minority Christian sect with strict gender roles for its dwindling populace. Her aunt and grandfather killed themselves and the shadow of that loss haunts both her grandmother and her mother, but they both cope, or fight as Swiv puts it, in different ways. As a narrator, Swiv is charming and hilarious, her grandmother even moreso. I laughed and cried reading this book; I can’t think of a higher endorsement. —T.O.

I think this is the essay collection I recommended the most this year. Miller, known primarily for his poetry, is just so smart and thoughtful and nuanced about all things, especially race and class and queerness. Experimental in form, his essays range from explorations of race and class in his native Jamaica to the surprising alienation of visiting Kenya and Senegal as a Caribbean man to the community of Black queer boys who he hangs out with in Kingston. Just a lovely, thoughtful read. —T. O.
 


An extension of the 2018 New Yorker essay of the same name, the book is part eulogy for her late mother and part love letter to Korean food and culture. Zauner (who fronts the indie-rock band Japanese Breakfast) writes with sobering clarity about her depression, her mother’s cancer diagnosis, and the food they ate together, with the titular Korean American supermarket at its core. She shares in elegant prose her experience growing up with a dual ethnicity and longing to feel at home; Oregonians, in particular, will enjoy reading about her upbringing in Eugene and her countless local references. It’s an evergreen tale of grieving, coping, and exploring the culinary palates that make up Zauner’s vibrant world. Like a home-cooked meal, this one should be savored. —Emerson Malone
 


It takes a talented writer to make a nonfiction book feel like a sweeping, multidimensional novel, but Keefe accomplishes it in his excellent Empire of Pain. Keefe, a New Yorker staff writer, follows the trail of the US opioid epidemic all the way back to the root, unraveling how one family caused massive amounts of heartache and destruction.It’s remarkable how Keefe is able to distill such a complicated story into one that really comes down to just a few people: the three Sackler brothers; one company, Purdue Pharma; and one drug, Oxycontin. In his telling, each brother is ambitious and hungry for attention and fame, but none as much as oldest brother Arthur, who Keefe paints as an almost maniacally ambitious man who set the stage for generations of his family to pursue money in the pursuit of literally anything else. Each subsequent cast of Sackler relatives, the cold and calculating Richard Sackler of the next generation, and the hypocritical and out-of-touch David Sackler of the next, shows how money and power can rot a family tree to its core. Keefe is able to so intimately describe each Sackler he profiles it almost feels like you are reading a transcript of their own inner monologues, a remarkable feat.Ultimately, this is a book about how a few misguided and greedy people can cause an outside amount of damage on the world and impact far more lives than they ever could have imagined. Isn’t that the perfect read for 2021? —Stephanie McNeal Advertisement     
 


In this memoir, Miller deftly tackles her life with Crohn’s disease while dissecting how the medical community treats people with chronic illnesses — especially women — and giving advice for those living with a chronic illness. Her writing moves from raw and sometimes grotesque bodily details to outrage at a US medical system that consistently fails the chronically ill and disabled community. Miller’s narrative is not that of a person who wants their story to be pitied. Rather, it’s an up-close glimpse into Crohn’s and the ways any body, not just Miller’s own, can revolt, and it’s a call for change in the medical community. As a reader with chronic illnesses, I found myself intensely relating to Miller’s impotent frustration at her body as well as her descriptions and advice about medical PTSD and the ways illness can trigger past traumas. —M.K.
 


When’s the last time a performance truly touched you? I mean, stopped you in your tracks, left your mouth agape, opened up your soul-type of performance? Abdurraqib, an occasional BuzzFeed News contributor, describes these euphoric instances of music and dance with such detail and elation, it almost feels like you’re listening to a friend pour their heart out about a night that changed their life. From televised dance marathons and blackface to Merry Clayton’s iconic background vocals on the Rolling Stones song “Gimme Shelter” to the Beyoncé effect, Abdurraqib not only speaks poetically of the impact these productions had on him, but also the historical and cultural significance they’ve played in society throughout the years. I found myself taking a deep dive on YouTube after every chapter, just so I could feel a slither of what he was chronicling. One of the most remarkable things about Abdurraqib’s love letter to Black performance is the unapologetic and brazen way he delivers his perspective while also dousing readers in the nuances of that same topic. And although art is subjective, he affirms just how liberating it can be.—M.M.
 


Radtke looks at the US’s unique brand of loneliness and the myriad ways we as a culture suppress it; it can weaken your immune system, make you hypervigilant, take years off your life expectancy, and perforate your reality. She considers what it means to be alone from an anthropological, biological, and pop cultural perspective; she asks what we can learn about longing and alienation from Emily Dickinson, Princess Diana, Don Draper, or Yayoi Kusama. The core American tenet of rugged cowboy individualism has unraveled into an epidemic of loneliness. The illustrations of Seek You are stunning, a complement to the sobering thought exercise in understanding one’s solitary position in the universe. —E.M.Read an excerpt here.
 


Donald Antrim’s newest memoir, One Friday in April, has stuck with me since I first read it earlier this year. With exceptional clarity and tremendous self-compassion, Antrim methodically recounts the moments that led up to committing himself to a psychiatric hospital for several months and the harrowing experience of trying to find the help he needed to bring himself back from psychosis, including treatments of ECT. It’s the clearest account of bringing oneself back from the brink of mental collapse I can remember. It’s also a masterwork of empathy. (Disclosure: Donald Antrim was my professor at Columbia University in 2009.) —Karolina Waclawiak
 


Chicago journalist Dawn Turner charts the divergent paths of three little girls — her younger sister Kim, her childhood best friend Debra, and Dawn herself — in this powerful memoir. Growing up together in a housing complex in 1970s Bronzeville, Turner is an ambitious student, while her younger sister Kim skips school and mouths off to their mother. Debra, meanwhile, is a class clown, who, as she ages, becomes more interested in partying and drugs. While Turner goes on to become an accomplished journalist, Kim, who has an alcohol addiction, dies of a heart attack at only 24, while Debra is eventually imprisoned for killing a man. How these girls — who grew up in the same building in a working-class neighborhood once famous for its Black luminaries but besieged by institutional neglect, violence, and drug addiction — had such different life experiences is the central question of this book. Turner provides no easy answers while passing no judgment. —T.O. (From “25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down”) Advertisement     
 


Albert Samaha’s Concepcion is probably the most satisfying first-gen immigrant memoir I’ve read in recent memory. As he reaches the age his mother was when she migrated to the US from the Philippines, Samaha investigates his mother’s beliefs that led her here, their family history, and whether a life in America was worth it after all. Samaha, who is half Filipino and half Lebanese, charts not just his family’s immigration story, but the story of countless others who came around that time too. Part-memoir and part-journalistic venture, Concepcion is both a time capsule about a family’s hopes and desires, as well as a history lesson for those who don’t know much about US immigration, Spanish colonialism, and the legacy of imperialism. It’s a personal story that only a reporter could write. (Full disclosure: Samaha is an editor at BuzzFeed News, and I also wrote a blurb for his book before its release.) Advertisement     The book is, at once, informative but approachable, heartbreaking but hopeful. It doesn’t matter where your family is from, where they ended up, or where you think you belong — Concepcion speaks to the inherently human desire to build something better. —Scaachi Koul (From ""25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down"")●

There were plenty of predictable new tech things in 2021, like the latest iPhones or laptops. These are some of the weird, fun, or just useful things we tried out and actually recommend — from e-bikes to a cheapo phone stand, guitar pedals, and even a ’70s-style role-playing game.These items were independently selected by staff and except where noted, they spent their own money on it.

AirPods Max — $549 at AppleLook, Apple’s AirPods Max are some expensive headphones — like months'-worth-of-groceries expensive (Apple loaned BuzzFeed a pair to review.) And let’s be honest, your current earbuds probably sound pretty great and have more daily use cases. But if you feel you need over-ear headphones, the AirPods Max are a really good choice. They pump out clear, gloriously rich sound with solid separation. I am no audiophile, so I’ll not belabor this with “omg a unique magnesium cone!” minutiae. What I will say is that these headphones adeptly handled everything I threw at them, from the most annoyingly quiet Sufjan Stevens to colon-rupturing Swedish math metal. And they nailed the low note on Beastie Boys’ “Shake Your Rump,” which is the bass metric all headphones should be judged on. Beyond this, they’re thoughtfully designed, though their precious little charging purse is a bit much. So, yeah, if you’re intent on purchasing some high-end headphones, you’re not going to go wrong with these. But also: Groceries are a fun thing to have. —John Paczkowski Advertisement  
 


Casper Glow Light — $116 at CasperIt’s a very nice ambient light. You spin it to make it brighter or dimmer, which is both fun and handy. I use it as a bedside light and also as mood lighting in the living room when I watch TV at night. Then I can shut everything off and go to the bathroom or back to bed using just this light, which makes me feel like I’m in an old-timey movie using a candlestick. Convenient and pleasant! —Shannon Keating Advertisement  
 


Apple AirTags for my TV remote and rubber remote case — AirTags: $29 for one or $99 for four at Apple. Case: $7.99 at Amazon.The remote is by far the worst part of the older-model Apple TVs. It’s somehow super slippery in your hand and so light it feels hard to control. It’s super thin and small, the perfect size for losing between couch cushions. The newest 4K Apple TVs come with an improved remote, which is sold separately for $59, but that’s way more than I want to spend.So instead I put one of these rubber covers on my current remote. It makes it grippy and easy to hold, and the bright color is easy to find, which was great until my toddler decided it is her most coveted toy. Finding the remote very quickly became a daily, sometimes hourly issue. Either my daughter had run off with it, or an adult had hidden it from her to prevent that from happening. Advertisement  So I AirTagged the remote. The case has a special slot to accommodate Apple’s little item-tracking device. The “Precision Finding” feature in the iPhone’s Find My app makes it easy to find lost things like TV remotes with a visual tracking feature that approximates how far away an item is. And the extra weight the AirTag adds to the remote feels nice in the hand. If you’re only ever going to track a TV remote, you might consider Tile’s cheaper tracking device, but if you’re an iPhone person prone to misplacing more than one item (I wanted one for my keychain as well as my husband’s keys and one to stick in our car for the times I forgot where I parked), then the AirTag four-pack makes a lot of sense (Apple loaned me AirTags for review, but I liked them enough I bought my own.) —Katie Notopoulos
 


Janome 2212 sewing machine — $199 at AmazonAt some point last winter, I developed an itch for making things with my hands. I dreamed of becoming a DIY person, and that dream wore out my credit card. I bought paint, canvases, 10 balls of yarn, knitting needles, embroidery hoops, a hot glue gun that’s still sitting in my drawer, unopened. And in my frenzy, I also got a sewing machine, a Janome 2212 that Google led me to believe was “an easy sewing machine for beginners.”To my great surprise, it was not easy. Sewing machines have too many knobs and too many labels, too many sections to thread your string through and around, and yet are so finicky that you have to wonder why we’ve gone to the moon but can’t make a simpler, more efficient machine for sewing. It’s a messy and frustrating hobby, and it will fill up your room with scrap fabric and half-finished projects. I’ve lost entire days using this thing. I’ve made dresses, I’ve altered sweaters, and I’ve watched hours of YouTube tutorials explaining what the hell a French seam is and how to sew a zipper on. You have to follow instructions and be patient, two qualities I don’t care for. None of the clothes I’ve made have ever come out well; there’s always a loose thread somewhere and wonky stitching. But it’s also, somehow, meditative, and when you’re out in a dress you made and someone asks where it’s from, you get to say, “Thanks, I made it. Just don’t look too closely.” —Clarissa-Jan Lim
 


RadRover 6 Plus electric bike — $1,999 at Rad Power BikesI can’t afford the RadRover 6 Plus electric bike, but I was lucky enough to try it (Rad Power Bikes loaned BuzzFeed a bike to review) and, yes, I liked it. Loved it, actually. And I say that as someone who has never quite understood the electric bike phenomenon. But after this bike took me to a favorite fishing hole at 22 mph and then off-roaded me up a poorly maintained trail right to the water without requiring really anything of me or my rickety knee, I get it. I am not a bike expert. My last bike was stolen, and the one before that was a trashed Huffy Thunder Road. But I found the RadRover to be pretty amazing, though it is quite heavy and built like a small motorcycle. Great ride, good battery life, and very easy to use — even for e-bike Luddites like me. —John Paczkowski
 


Plasma Coil guitar pedal — $350 from Third ManThough you undoubtedly know Jack White best for his guitar work in bands like the White Stripes and the Raconteurs, he's doing some equally amazing things with Third Man Records, an independent label and, most importantly for the purposes of this review, a purveyor of a guitar pedal called the Plasma Coil. This is an apt name for a pedal that distorts the notes you play on a guitar by expressing them as a electrical discharges *you can see* courtesy a xenon gas–filled tube. Designed by Gamechanger Audio, the Plasma Coil literally amplifies audio signals to 3,500 volts. It sounds as badass as it looks — like a 50-pound wasp nest. It’s pretty much lightning in a box and an absolute blast to play. And if you dig the Plasma Coil, it’s worth noting that a few of Third Man’s other pedals are equally impressive, including the Bumble Buzz, (a sick fuzz box) and the Triplegraph (a digital octave pedal with individual octave-up and octave-down channels that make your guitar sound like a noise in a science fiction movie). —John Paczkowski
 


The Fantasy Trip: Legacy Edition role-playing game — $119 at AmazonSince I was (a) locked down at home and (b) no longer commuting, I had extra hours and nostalgia for the role-playing game of my adolescence — a criminally simple and fun one called the Fantasy Trip. Popular for its single-player adventures back in the 1970s and perfect for the pandemic era, the game was revived two years ago by its original designer in a legacy edition. A throwback to the mayhem-flavored era of pen-and-paper games, the easy but elegant rules allow for intriguing match-ups against monsters represented by cardboard square game pieces that evoke the era when light beer was new. Anyone who’s bored stiff at the thought of learning the latest gaudy Dungeons & Dragons rules but wants to bump off a band of bugbears, or who’s middle-aged enough to try to entice (force) your kids to do so with easy-to-learn rules, might give it a shot. I managed after a few tries to get my band of paper bravoes through a death test dungeon after a few weekends of on-and-off playing, and it has been a solace on rainy weekends ever since. In a nice mixture of old and new, I now play it over Roll20.net with an old high school buddy now living in Germany. —Dan Vergano
 


Lamicall metal phone stand — $9.99 at AmazonIn 2021, this became an essential part of my workstation. It allows my phone to act as a second screen (technically a third screen, since I already use a laptop plus a monitor). I previously had a flat wood stand that held the phone in a way that completely covered its speakers and microphone, making it impossible for video calling. This metal style also allows you to charge while on the stand. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Anker Nebula Cosmos 4K projector — $699 at AmazonWho needs a TV when any flat surface in your home is a screen? Anker’s Cosmos projector is remarkably good at playing movies on bare white walls with a clarity of picture and sound that will satisfy most everyone but AV aficionados. With Dolby Digital Plus 360° theatrical audio and a sharp 1080p resolution, a 900 ANSI Lumen autofocus display that can be recalibrated almost instantly and sharpened with the press of a button, the Cosmos solidly and accurately plays everything from home movies on a bedroom wall to Aliens on a bedsheet in your backyard.

LectroFan white noise machine — $45 at AmazonFour mammals live in my home, and we all need our beauty rest. The busy New York City block we live on poses challenges: barflies late at night, trash trucks first thing in the morning, and every other imaginable city noise in the hours between. That’s why we swear by white noise machines. My wife and I share one. My 18-month-old falls asleep to one.

Facebook Portal Go — $199 at PortalYes, there’s an irony that despite everything that BuzzFeed News has reported about Facebook over the past few years, I am recommending a Facebook product. If you want to feel truly pure about not supporting Meta, Facebook’s new parent company, well, go ahead and delete your Instagram account. It probably makes more money off showing you ads than the company would off a hardware purchase. I’ll wait.The truth is, the Portal is a great video chatting device. The smart camera follows you around the room and can accommodate more than one face at a time. It’s great for connecting distant grandparents and small kids, particularly the rechargeable Portal Go, which can be carried from room to room. My kid loves taking Grandma out into the yard to show off his toys and adventures. Advertisement     When I first tested the Go (Facebook loaned BuzzFeed a Portal to review), my one big complaint was that there was no way to fully disable the “Watch Together” function during a call, which can be an issue if you want to control the videos your kids watch. Meta’s head of VR and Portal promised to fix this. So starting in December, you can block Watch Together completely during calls. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Vilo mesh Wi-Fi routers — $70 for three at AmazonYou may have heard of this “mesh Wi-Fi” thing from your friends who have bigger houses and more tech smarts than you. The Vilo is the mesh router for everyone else. The idea is that instead of one crappy router you stash under your bed, you evenly space three futuristic white bricks throughout your house. As you walk from room to room, you’ll always have a clear, strong Wi-Fi connection. Why would someone who lives in a small Brooklyn apartment need three Wi-Fi routers? The obvious answer is: Why the hell not? Vilos are about $70 for three and surprisingly attractive for a router. By comparison, a fancy mesh system from Google is $349. Wirecutter’s “budget pick” is still $130. I loathe spending money, but these guys just make sense. —Scott PhamOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

303,"Richard Trask, who had been the public face of the high-profile investigation, was fired by the FBI following his July arrest. He is one of three agents in the Whitmer kidnapping case whom the government will no longer call as witnesses.","


The FBI agent who was the public face of the investigation into the alleged plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer pleaded no contest Monday to a misdemeanor charge of assaulting his wife earlier this year.Richard Trask, who was fired from the FBI after the July 18 incident, was sentenced to time served — two days in jail following his arrest in a grocery store parking lot after he fought with his wife in their home at the end of a night that featured a visit to a swingers party. Advertisement     Trask’s wife, appearing in Kalamazoo County court via Zoom, read a statement in which she speculated that her husband might have been drugged with the date rape drug GHB at the party or had an adverse reaction to mixing prednisone and alcohol. “This man has served and protected you for the past 20 years and the prosecution has chosen to crucify him unnecessarily,” she told the judge.In his own statement, also delivered via Zoom, Trask told the court, “I cannot recall any details of the night but I do take responsibility.” He added, “As a result of this situation, I’ve lost the only career I’ve ever known.”Trask’s legal troubles are among many complications for federal prosecutors pursuing kidnapping conspiracy charges against five men accused of plotting to spirit Whitmer away from her vacation home last fall.Trask was the agent who signed the affidavit that supported the men’s arrest on Oct. 7, 2020, and he later testified in federal court in favor of keeping the men locked up. Because he no longer works at the bureau, the government will no longer call on him to testify at the trial in the case, scheduled to begin March 8. Advertisement     Two other FBI agents central to the case, Jayson Chambers and Henrik Impola, will also not be on the Justice Department’s witness lists. They were the handling agents for a key informant, known as “Dan,” who infiltrated an armed extremist group whose members developed the plot.In August, federal prosecutors said that Chambers would not be a witness at trial. The announcement came five days after BuzzFeed News revealed that he had incorporated a security business in 2019 that was linked to an internet troll.Then on Friday, prosecutors said that Impola, who has been accused of perjury in an unrelated case, would not be called either. Although prosecutors have denied that the allegations have substance, the issue came up again in Michigan state court on Monday, where a hearing had been scheduled to review claims of entrapment by three defendants in a case closely tied to the kidnapping plot.In addition to the five federal defendants, a sixth pleaded guilty in January and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution. Eight additional men have been charged in Michigan state court for providing material support to terrorism, for a total of 14. Both federal and state prosecutors deny they entrapped the men. “We believe we have proof beyond a reasonable doubt of their guilt and will be presenting it at trial,” Assistant Attorney General John Pallas stated in Jackson County court Monday.But defense attorney Andrew Kirkpatrick, who represents Paul Bellar in the state case, said that the impeachment allegations against Impola could undermine the government’s case. “His credibility is absolutely at issue with this court regarding any entrapment motions,” Kirkpatrick told Judge Thomas Wilson. He and attorneys for two other defendants said that in light of Friday’s news, Impola would not be a witness and they needed additional time to review information about the government’s internal inquiry into the perjury claim.Kirkpatrick said he would subpoena the FBI for that information, and at his request, Jackson County judge Thomas Wilson granted an adjournment on the entrapment issue until late February.Impola referred requests for comment last week to the FBI, which declined to comment.In the same hearing, Wilson denied a motion by the Michigan attorney general to reinstate charges against Bellar and two other defendants of making terrorist threats. Those charges had been dismissed by a lower court in March. Advertisement     Wilson similarly rejected a request by the defense to overrule the district court and dismiss all charges, while granting a request to reduce bond for Joseph Morrison, the founder of the organized militant group Wolverine Watchmen, to $5,000 from $150,000. Morrison is expected to be released before Christmas. He has been in jail for 438 days.

304,Tucked in a library branch in Manhattan is the Picture Collection — a repository of about 1.5 million images available to the public.,"


The picture collection consists of exactly what you might think — visual information from magazines, postcards, clippings, and photographs collected by the New York Public Library’s staff since 1915. From Singapore to silver mining, Oklahoma to olive oil, there’s a folder containing a century's worth of photographs for nearly everything. For visitors and artists, one of the most appealing things about the Picture Collection is that it’s one of the few spaces left available to us that is untouched by algorithms.Some of the library’s most popular collections are costumes (for fashion designers) or New York City (for people who are curious about the place where they are living or visiting). “I like the subjects that are a little bit conceptual,” said Jessica Cline, the supervising librarian of the Picture Collection. “You maybe have a visual in your head when you think of [a] word, but there’s not a standard representation for it — like wind, or noise.” Earlier this year, the library decided to move the stacks to request only, prompting outcry from the photography community. The library changed its plans collection remains circulating and browsable. Advertisement  
 


When the collection began a century ago, someone might have come to the library to find information on, for example, owls. In addition to the books and the encyclopedias available, the picture library served as a visual repository — remember, no Google image search. A person would make a request and a librarian would put a folder together of clippings or images that they would find and pass it on to the seeker. Advertisement  “It became a really popular service,” said Cline, who notes that the practice was not uncommon in other libraries in the area. The physical location of the Picture Collection has changed, but to this day, about 1.5 million pictures are organized into 12,000 folders by subject. You can find a folder for highly visual events like avalanches and swimming pools, as well as things like junk, kidnapping, labels, and lampshades.“The Picture Collection was formed in response to public demand, guided and shaped by the public's requests and their hunger for images,” said artist Taryn Simon, whose work is currently hanging within the branch of the library that houses the archive. “Going into that long history that has shaped American culture was like going down a rabbit hole.”The collection at the New York Public Library wasn’t the first in the country, but it has become one of the most loved and most enduring archives thanks in part to a radical and largely overlooked woman named Romona Javitz. Javitz, who took over at age 26 in 1930, was passionate about serving the public’s desire for images, “prioritizing access over preservation,” writes Joshua Chuang in the introduction to The Color of a Flea’s Eye by Taryn Simon, a book and portable representation of the Picture Collection. Advertisement  
 


“Artists use the collections endlessly,” Cline said. Andy Warhol stole hundreds of images from the collection surreptitiously — ironically, you can now request to view them in his archives by appointment. Warhol had a boyfriend who worked at the collection in the 1950s, and Cline said that artist would come and take images out of the collection that he later used in his art. “There was a retrospective at the Whitney a couple of years ago, and they had one of our Picture Collection pictures there hanging in the exhibition; you could see our little stamp on it and everything,"" Cline said. Advertisement  Despite discouraging outright theft, the collection encourages artists and creatives to come to use it for all purposes. The librarians interact with artists and the public on the collection’s Instagram account, too. “I wanted people to see how others actually use the collection, and it’s been a huge success,” Cline said.Simon has been inspired by the physical collection for over a decade. Simon’s art is vast and ambitious — and each project can be radically different from the next. Her work in the past has included performance, sculpture, and photography — from installation The Cold Hole to Contraband, where she went behind the scenes at John F. Kennedy International Airport to photograph contraband seized on international flights.In 2012, Simon and the artist Aaron Swartz built the website Image Atlas, which allows visitors to type one word into the search engine, like “candy,” “woman,” or “hope,” and see what the results would look like for the word in different languages on local search engines. “You can see all the comparative ways in which visual material is categorized,” Simon said, “and it made me think of the Picture Collection, which is the manual version of what we were exploring and something that precedes all of these capabilities [on the internet].” Advertisement  
 


Simon returned to the Picture Collection for her new work, The Color of a Flea’s Eye, which has become both a book and an exhibition at the library that is up through May 2022. “[Taryn] really worked hard to bring it into the library,” Cline said. “It’s basically her love letter to the Picture Collection and to the library. She really wanted it to be seen here to interact with the collection.”Simon’s work mimics the folders at the library, with pictures of the collection’s folders of veils, men, “rear views,” and smell. “It's a tricky thing to describe, but that's part of its beauty, that it's about touching and being,” Simon said. “The picture library is like a living organism.” Advertisement  Her works hang in a room alongside paintings that have been in the library since its very founding, with the overall effect encouraging the viewer to think about the space as an installation as a whole. “It's a shrapnel of imagery that's then captured and organized, but ultimately abstract with these accidental juxtapositions that come from that,” Simon said. “It's a tricky thing to describe, but that's part of its beauty, that it's about touching and being. You can discover all these things that aren't on Google. It's a different way of functioning, how it makes the brain work.”

As shown in the short clip, Kim appeared to ignore the fan and instead walked straight past, remaining silent.

Advertisement     “This is so misogynistic. I don’t see people doing this shit to Kanye.

306,"A Theragun, sunscreen, and the Revlon One-Step made life a little nicer.","


2021 was stressful. No kidding. The staff here at BuzzFeed News have some recommendations for what they tried at home over the last year that they actually loved and helped make life a little easier. Things like a Theragun for sore muscles, fancy face wash, a cheap dupe for fancy sunscreen, and the best workout headband for short hair. Perhaps the strongest recommendation is that two separate people tried out and swear by acupressure mats for headaches and stress.These items were independently selected by staff and they spent their own money on it. Just so you know, BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them. Oh, and FYI — prices are accurate and items in stock as of the time of publication. Advertisement  
 


Acupressure mat — $19.47 from AmazonI get really bad headaches periodically and generally bounce between over-the-counter medications, none of which seem to make a dent in the pain. Earlier this year I asked a neighbor with migraines if he’d had any medication successes recently, and he said, “You know what has helped? This.” I expected the link would go to some newfangled headache medicine or perhaps an herbal remedy, but instead it went to this truly odd product, a yoga mat crossed with a medieval torture device rendered in crisp white plastic spikes Somewhat inexplicably, it does in fact seem to help my headaches, and it also causes me to fall into a weird deep sleep within moments of lying down on it. (Warning: Set an alarm; I recently conked out for two hours on this thing, and my back was aflame when I finally woke up.) I have found it comforting to know that when the pain gets bad, I can just lie down on my bed of piercing plastic nails. —Sam Henig Advertisement  
 


Theragun Prime — $299 at Macy’sYou know what I got into over the pandemic? Running. Really original, I know. But between the stress of the lockdown and the stress of being a new father, I needed a consistent and mindless physical release. Advertisement  You know what happens when you run regularly? Your whole lower body starts to hurt. I tend to be skeptical of shortcuts around pain. I don’t really think you can trick the body. And if you do, I think you tend to pay for it later. But a few months after I did my first loop around Prospect Park, wracked with calf and hip pain, I caved and ordered a Theragun. Yes, a Theragun. That loud and heavy percussive massager that looks like a sex toy for German ravers.The thing works. You stick it where it hurts and then it hurts less. Doesn’t get much simpler. There are lots of things I don’t like about it. It costs too much, and when I lie on the couch blasting the tension out of my quads, my wife will sometimes cruise by and ask, “Pleasuring yourself again?” To which I say, 20 miles a week may strain my knee, but words will never hurt me. —Joe Bernstein
 


Contoured sleep mask — $18.99 at AmazonLet me start by being really honest: I cannot function with less than eight hours of sleep. I know there are a lot of freaks out there who are proud to sleep like five hours a night or whatever, but I am not like you. Sleeping is my favorite — and incredibly vital!! — hobby, so you know you can trust me, and I'm here to tell you to get this contoured sleep mask made of memory foam. It has changed my sleeping life in a way no other product ever has. The second night I used it, I slept straight through my alarm and got a full 12 hours of deep sleep, which was terrifying for the purposes of my alarm’s quality, but fantastic for my mind and body. It's pitch-black in there, but the contouring means you can open your eyes even in the mask, plus you can keep the blinds open and let the sunshine in to help you wake up once you take it off — but not a moment earlier. I also find the soft memory foam to be sort of like an extra pillow just for my eyes, and the act of putting it on when it's time to sleep keeps me off my phone and tells my brain it's time to shut shit down. I love her. —Addy Baird
 


La Prairie foam cleanser — $90 at Neiman MarcusA few years back, a Very Nice person gifted me with some travel-size products from a Swiss company called La Prairie. I knew nothing about the brand. They seemed nice. A small tub of something called skin caviar, a refining lotion, and the one standout: a tiny tube of foaming face cleanser. It smelled great — a faint hint of peppermint, maybe? (It’s pink, so maybe my brain filled in that scent on its own.) It was unlike any cleanser I had used before. It rinsed away in seconds (no soapy feel) and left my face feeling weirdly super clean. I have dry skin, and it never felt like this particular product was drying it out more — rather, it was the opposite. Really, it wasn’t like any other facial cleansing product I’ve tried (and I’ve tried lots). I only needed a tiny bit, and it lasted forever. When I ran out of all these cute little products, I had a bit of a shock. This stuff is expensive! As in, some of the products are $200-an-ounce expensive. (Ahem, $180 sunscreen, anyone?) Anyway, I was like, Welp that’s nice, now where’s my favorite Neutrogena cleansing gel? (It’s also a great product.) However, this year I found the La Prairie foam cleanser for $90. I know, that’s a LOT for a face wash. But it’s a 4-oz. tube (which, BTW, is huge by beauty product standards), and it’s lasted for months — it may even last a year. I don’t generally spend that much on beauty products, but this is the rare item that seemed like it would be OK for a fancyish gift or an occasional splurge. [Editor’s note: We found this for cheaper on Amazon, but the reviews for the seller said that it may be expired or counterfeit, which is not uncommon for high-end skincare products on Amazon or other reseller sites.] —Theresa Tamkins
 


Acure Curiously Clarifying Shampoo — $5.99 at AmazonI have combination hair and exercise a lot, so finding the perfect shampoo has been a lifelong journey. Acure is affordable, smells great, has a vegan formula, never dries out my scalp, and has kept my hair feeling shiny from my roots to my tips! —Nicole Fallert
 


Revlon One-Step Dryer Brush — $34.88 on AmazonIt takes less than 10 minutes for me to dry my long, thick hair with this dryer brush. It doesn't dry out my hair or scalp — and is loved by many of my friends with different hair types from curly to straight. —Nicole Fallert
 


Larq self-cleaning water bottle — $95 at LarqI don’t know about you but I am really bad about washing my water bottle. Frankly, it just doesn’t cross my mind often enough, and then I realize it’s gross and I’m embarrassed and avoid dealing with it. This is probably something I should address in therapy, but until then, there’s the Larq self-cleaning water bottle. Yes, $95 is a ridiculously high price for a water bottle — but if there were a water bottle worth such a price tag, it would be this one. Not only does this thing clean itself with a UV light inside the lid, but it is also able to filter water (with two different settings based on how much filtering the water might need). And thanks to some sort of god-tier insulation, it keeps my water cold as hell. My previous main water bottle was a giant 42-oz. Hydroflask, which was literally giving me shoulder problems from carrying it around. The Larq bottle is 17 oz., which means I’m filling it up often but also that it fits perfectly in my bag. —Addy Baird
 


Intake Breathing nose magnets — $67 from Intake BreathingI have a garbage septum that has robbed me of clear and easy breathing for decades. It interferes with my sleep, makes exercising annoying, and on occasion humiliates me in meetings or public gatherings when I suddenly realize I have unconsciously begun pulling on my cheek to stretch open a nostril. It sucks. And, yes, I should have it fixed surgically. But instead of doing that, I have relied on a bucket full of pharmacy-shelf flop-nostril countermeasures. Breathe Right's little nose strips, nostril dilators, I’ve tried them all. They have all helped to some extent, but none have given me the throw-the-windows-wide nostril opening relief of Intake Breathing’s nose magnets. These things improve on the concept of nasal strips by turning them into an inflexible and *magnetized* nose bridge that then attaches to little metal-filled bandage-y things you stick on your nostrils. Ridiculous, you say? Ridiculously ingenious. Because they are not flimsy, and they rely on the POWER of magnetism instead of the power of adhesive athletic tape, Intake opens up your airways and keeps them that way without falling off your face. Yes, I look like I have a Transformer on my nose when I'm wearing it. But I can breathe without feeling like I’m suffocating, and that’s all that matters. —John Paczkowski
 


Shakti Mat — $69 at ShaktiThe Shakti Mat is a modern-day bed of nails. It is a deeply weird synergy of BDSM and meditation — but once you get over the initial pain, it is incredibly relaxing. I have no idea how or why it works. But it was definitely more fun than the pandemic. —Tom Warren
 


Innisfree SPF 36 daily sunscreen — $15 at AmazonI’m old enough to have observed the frightening reality of sun damage and have been scared straight into assiduous sunscreen application. I previously tried and liked Supergoop’s “Play” everyday SPF 50 sunscreen, but at $22 it’s kind of pricey. So I looked for some cheaper options, and the closest dupe for Supergood was from K-beauty brand Innisfree for $15. It has the same texture that is moisturizing and light, “dewy” without being sticky. I have dry skin, and I don’t love the matte finish that La Roche-Posay, Neutrogena, and Sun Bum’s face options have. —Katie Notopoulos Advertisement  
 


Harry’s deodorant — $5 at Harry’sDo you sweat more than you’d like? Profusely, perhaps? Are you tired of spending $12-plus on “clinical-strength” over-the-counter antiperspirants that smell like your grandmother? Then check out Harry’s sweat control solutions. The company, which started out as a subscription shaving outfit, now makes a line of delightful deodorants. The scents are interesting and not at all cloying (goodbye “baby powder,” hello “stone” and “redwood”), the “enhanced sweat control” version works just as well as anything you’d buy from BIG DEODORANT, and it only costs $5. —John Paczkowski
 


Temple Tape sweatband – $8.95 and Temple TapeLike so many other people over the last year and change, my hair grew out a lot. Like, *a lot.* But when it came time to reenter society and get a haircut, I wanted to keep some of the volume I had picked up over lockdown. My new barber made it happen (Masako, you’re seriously the best) but three weeks after any cut, it’d run into a problem. My longer hair would start getting in the way at the gym or on a run. Some buffs I had on hand before the pandemic worked fine when I was home, but I didn’t want to be wearing some handout covered in corporate logos all the time. Enter Temple Tape headbands, which I found while looking for a headband brand I could order outside of Amazon. They’re durable, keep my hair up and sweat out of my eyes, and come in a bunch of simple colors. They’re even based in Brooklyn so I get to say I’m supporting a local business.I feel like headbands are having a moment. They’re ubiquitous on college and pro football sidelines and even Drake sported one while boxing. The appeal is easy to understand. They’re functional, but they’re also so fun to wear that I have a headband on during all my workouts now, even if I got my hair cut the day before. —Eric MorrowOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

307,"A Marine discussed the viral photo he took of a movie theater in Kentucky destroyed by a tornado: ""I haven’t been able to find one word to describe everything.”","


After flying home from Chicago on Saturday, Shawn Triplett drove straight to where most of the damage was. A tornado had struck his hometown of Mayfield, Kentucky, a day before, killing at least 76 people — including 12 children — across the state and destroying most homes and buildings. Triplett, a Marine with a truck full of recovery equipment, wanted to do anything he could to help.“It’s a cliché thing to say, but in the Marine Corps, there’s this saying that Marines run toward the gunfight; they run toward danger,” Triplett told BuzzFeed News. “I had that mentality turned on. I was ready to go. ‘Let’s do something right now.’” Advertisement     He first went to a volunteer center, where he met Liam Kennedy, a photojournalist from Bloomberg. Triplett offered to escort him around town so he could take photos. That’s when the two discovered the destroyed theater.
 


“I ended up in the back of the theater, and it was just real sobering,” Triplett said. “It was the first time that day that we had a chance to just stand there and take it all in, and we weren’t even talking. We were just taking it in and taking a break.” Advertisement     Triplett pulled out his iPhone to snap a photo for his own memory. He didn’t think much of it until a few days later when he posted a series of his photos to Reddit. The photos show the empty theater, the town from eight stories high, crushed mail trucks, and the sun setting over piles of debris. As of Friday, the post has more than 157,000 upvotes.
 


“I just stood there, staring off and just letting all the emotions, you know, they all hit you at once,"" Triplett said. ""I haven’t been able to find one word to describe everything.”The pair also found a tall building across from the town's courthouse, where they climbed up to the eighth floor so they could see the town from a bird's-eye view.“I’ve seen plenty of war zones,” Triplett said. “I’ve seen just absolute destruction, what bombs and gunfire and things can do, in my years of the Marine Corps, and I’ve never seen anything with that much destruction.”Triplett is happy for publications to use his photos because he wants to draw more attention to the toy drive he is putting on for the kids who lost everything in the tornado right before Christmas. While he was in a church’s gym that was serving as a shelter, he walked around and overheard a son crying to his mother about losing his Christmas.
 


“It just broke me in half,” Triplett said. “I lost it. I don’t know all the variables of their story. They’re at a shelter. They probably lost their home, maybe they lost their jobs, maybe they lost their actual Christmas. I don’t know. It was just too much for me. That statement just split me in half.”Triplett began reaching out to his friends on social media and raising money for a toy drive. A GoFundMe fundraiser has surpassed $45,000 as of Friday. He said every dollar will go to toys, even if he loses money in gas and wrapping paper.
 


Looking around Mayfield, Triplett said, he's reminded of the Mister Rogers quote, “When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.’”“Every time I go back into town, I’m not paying attention to the destructive mess that I saw on the first day,"" Triplett said. ""I’m paying attention to, wow, everybody’s coming together.""

308,Facebook groups dedicated to fighting wind turbines are cropping up all around the country — and tearing small communities apart.,"


Bad vibrations abound. Many of them are obvious: We can sense them, measure the damage they do, try to counteract or avoid them. Others exist in a range outside the limit of normal human perception. Most of us go about our lives oblivious to these. But sometimes a person gains a new kind of awareness, one that gives form and name to the hidden forces in the air, in this country, at this moment. Such a person may become obsessed, tormented, desperate. Such a person may feel obligated to act.Erik and Chantelle Benko live in rural Sidney Township, Michigan, about 45 minutes northeast of Grand Rapids. They moved there in 2016, to a ramshackle ranch on 40 rolling acres, where they planned to breed American quarter horses and set up an equine-assisted psychotherapy practice. Getting the place in shape took several hundred thousand dollars, they said. But it was worth it to raise their two boys in a place where people knew each other and treated each other with respect, where kids got the first day of hunting season off from school, where you couldn’t pump gas without making friends with the clerk. The first night in his new home, the sky was so clear, Erik Benko said, “you felt like you could reach out and grab a handful of stars.”One day in October 2020, a post on the Facebook page for the Sidney Township Neighborhood Watch seized the Benkos’ attention. Jeffrey Lodholtz, a member of the township planning commission, had published a screenshot of a text message from Jed Welder, a local farmer and township trustee. Like hundreds of rural and agricultural communities across the country, Sidney Township, open, gusty, and short on cash, was receiving interest from a wind energy company. Wind farms can bring municipal tax benefits, construction jobs, and payments for fallow or devalued cropland. The planning commission was considering a new law to set standards to encourage development. Advertisement  “Have a vested interest in this project,” Welder wrote. “I’ve already gotten my first check.”“There are multiple things that need to be changed before we can just implement it,” Lodholtz responded.“So how long before you think we can get this thing signed!?” Welder asked.Wind energy companies lease land from individual owners and pay royalties based on the electricity generated by the turbines they build there. As Erik Benko read it, a township trustee was pressuring the planning commission to approve a development for his own profit. Other members of the Facebook group saw it this way, too. The comment section filled up with dozens of residents — dozens being a significant number in a township with a population of roughly 2,500 — outraged over this “vested interest.” Advertisement  For the Benkos, the post was a window onto a world they didn’t know existed: self-dealing and cold. A big corporation, Apex Clean Energy, had been skulking around their new home “in the shadows,” as Erik Benko said he came to realize, “wining and dining township officials” and making plans for the land. The Benkos began to educate themselves, and what they found was infuriating.“If you google some of those terms,” Erik Benko said, “this whole seedy underbelly opens up.”
 


The Benkos learned that turbines were nearly as tall as the Washington Monument, with 160-foot-long blades. They learned the turbines produce a mechanical hum that never stops. They learned there were people around the country, in communities just like theirs, who claimed, with ever-more-distressing certainty, that turbines destroyed their property values, kept them up at night, made them sick, gave their children epileptic seizures, caused their farm animals to miscarry, drove them insane. These anecdotes weren’t supported by medical evidence, necessarily, but they were so numerous — it seemed to the Benkos that so many people couldn't all be wrong. The Benkos pictured the huge blades that were already cutting through the air in neighboring Gratiot County, the farms below dark under their long shadows. It was unnatural, wrong. And if the people on Facebook were right, a corporation had been conspiring with the government to erect these steel monsters all around the county. (In a statement, Apex said, “For the Montcalm Wind project, and many other projects in our portfolio, Apex Clean Energy uses a community-based lease that guarantees equal treatment to all people.” It said Michigan had clear rules about whether local officials should recuse themselves over a “vested interest.”) Advertisement  “We felt like we were going to lose our entire life,” Chantelle Benko said. “Everything we worked night and day for.”
 


The Sidney Township neighborhood watch page was a place where a post about a lost dog ordinarily made for big news. The admin told the angry commenters to knock it off. But there was so much energy; it needed a place to go. Erik Benko knew that something had to happen. Someone had to act.On Oct. 29, the Benkos started a Facebook community page to raise awareness about — and fight — the development of wind energy in their area: “Montcalm County Citizens United.” Over the past year, it has grown into a political force in the area, joining a national network of such pages, all dedicated to organizing against wind energy projects at the local level.Like higher-profile local battles over mask mandates and critical race theory, disagreements over wind policy have become intensely antagonistic and frequently hysterical. But unlike those issues, opposition to turbines isn’t neatly polarized along red–blue lines: It often pits conservatives against conservatives and liberals against liberals. Nor does it revolve around a once-in-a-generation event, like a global pandemic. Instead, it’s elemental — quite literally, in the air. In this sense, it may offer the purest example yet of the power of social media to warp local politics in 2021, to make a single emotional issue stand in for and subsume all others. For the future of civic life in the United States, Montcalm County is a dark forecast of the way the winds are shifting.
 


The first industrial wind turbines in the United States started spinning in the early 1980s in California. Early wind farms were built far from people, in places like the arid Tehachapi Pass, which connects the San Joaquin Valley to the Mojave Desert, and the Delaware Mountains of Culberson County, Texas (pop: 2,188). From 1997 to 2009, the majority of American states enacted policies that require electrical utilities to use some clean sources — solar, hydro, wind. These, combined with federal tax credits for wind-generated electricity, helped create a $90 billion global wind turbine market as of 2019. Today, there are industrial-scale wind power facilities in 40 states, producing about 7% of the nation’s power. A plot of the nation’s wind turbines resembles a wide sash from the Upper Midwest, southwest through the plains, and finally into Texas.Once curiosities glimpsed through the window of a moving car, today wind farms are for many Americans fixtures of the environment. The United States Geological Survey counts more than 70,000 industrial turbines in the country. By the end of 2015, 1.4 million US homes were within 5 miles of a wind project, a more than 300% increase from 2010. This trend is set to continue. To address the climate crisis, President Biden has called for the country to eliminate carbon-producing energy sources by 2035, and wind power is expected to be a cornerstone of the renewable energy transition. In October, the administration announced a plan to build enormous wind farms along much of the US coastline.For the most part, Americans who live close to wind turbines either like them or don’t care. A 2019 study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that among wind turbine neighbors — people who live within about fives miles of an industrial wind farm — those with positive feelings toward the turbines outnumbered by 7 to 1 those with negative ones. Negative feelings toward turbines are associated with being able to hear the machines with the windows shut, thinking that the turbines don’t fit well with the landscape, and feeling that the planning process was unfair. Advertisement  Americans who don’t like wind projects have a way of making themselves heard. In 2001, a proposal for 130 turbines in Nantucket Sound drew opposition from an all-star cast of wealthy Massachusetts property owners, including Walter Cronkite, historian David McCullough, Bill Koch, Ted Kennedy, and Mitt Romney. “We cannot trash this extraordinary resource,"" then-governor Romney said in 2004. ""I've seen wind farms, and they are not pretty.” Donald Trump has been an outspoken, conspiratorial critic of wind farms ever since the Scottish government announced plans to build one in view of one of his golf courses. And for the past several years, a coalition of Hamptons residents including Estée Lauder heir Ronald Lauder and actress Edie Falco have fought against a proposed wind farm 35 miles off of Montauk.Modern wind turbines are big and getting bigger; the new GE Haliade-X 13MW is about twice the height and diameter of the London Eye Ferris wheel. Lots of people — like Mitt Romney — simply do not like to look at them, or are worried that the gargantuan devices will lower local property values. This has led many, including wind energy developers, to characterize opposition to wind projects as simple NIMBYism. It is a bipartisan phenomenon, as most NIMBYism is. And one of the most frequent objections to wind farms is aesthetic — that they will spoil the look and feel of a landscape.
 


But for some, the objection comes from a deeper and perhaps less calculating place. Folk superstition has long assigned certain winds enormous powers. The Foehn, which whips across the Alps, is blamed by some Swiss for headaches, nosebleeds, insomnia, anxiety, and depression. And France’s bitter Mistral is said to induce madness — including, notoriously, Vincent Van Gogh’s.In 2009, a New York pediatrician named Nina Pierpont self-published a book called Wind Turbine Syndrome: A Report on a Natural Experiment. Based on two dozen interviews with people who live near wind turbines, the book hypothesizes that wind turbines create a combination of infrasound — sound waves with a frequency below what humans can hear — and low-frequency background noise (think: your dishwasher) that can cause an alarming array of maladies, ranging from sleep problems and dizziness to panic and irritability. In May 2010, Ontario’s chief medical officer of health released a report averring that “no conclusions on the health impact of wind turbines can be drawn from Pierpont’s work due to methodological limitations including small sample size, lack of exposure data, lack of controls and selection bias.” But the book caught on, and over the past decade, anti-wind advocates added epileptic seizures, certain forms of cancer, and heart arrhythmia to the list of ailments.
 


The largest and most thorough epidemiological study of wind turbine noise was published by Health Canada in 2014. Notably, it is the only study of turbines that has ever supplemented self-reports of negative health effects with objective health measures, including blood pressure, heart rate, and levels of the stress hormone cortisol in hair samples. In more than 1,000 households at varying distances from wind farms, Health Canada found no link between exposure to turbine noise and illness, chronic disease, stress, or sleep quality.Crucially, though, it showed a correlation between increasing wind turbine noise and reports of annoyance. A 2011 paper in the journal Environmental Health suggested that “self reported health effects of people living near wind turbines are more likely attributed to physical manifestation from an annoyed state.” Another way of putting this is that something like wind turbine syndrome is real — it’s just not caused by hearing wind turbines. Rather, some scientists have suggested, it’s caused by hearing about how bad wind turbines are, producing what they call the “nocebo effect.” Indeed, the Health Canada study found that annoyance levels were significantly lower in people who materially benefitted from wind development, suggesting that a person’s prior associations with turbines play a major role in determining how disturbing they perceive them to be. The World Health Organization’s most recent environmental noise guidelines for Europe, published in 2018, conditionally recommend that turbines not rise above a weighted daily average of 45 decibels, about the volume of moderate rainfall. Noise levels above this, the report states, carry a 10% risk of a “highly annoyed population.”Over the past several years, like most every other area of human concern, wind opposition groups have moved onto Facebook, where they have networked, sharpened their rhetoric, and broadcast their annoyance. On hundreds of community pages like “Stop These Things,” “Great Lakes Wind Truth,” and “Montcalm County Citizens United,” people trade frightening images of turbine blades on fire, excerpts from Pierpont’s work, stories of friends of friends who have supposedly moved into their farmhouse closets to block out the drone of the turbines, PragerU videos that claim to debunk the promises of the renewable energy industry, and secondhand testimony from a French farmer who swears wind turbines damaged his livestock. (“My beasts just kept dying.”) Some of the pages have thousands of members and feature dozens of new posts a day. Many of them are misleading or false — and Facebook marks the odd post as such. Members almost never openly dispute the need for clean energy, and in fact they count some environmentalists among their ranks. Instead, they focus on the alleged greed of the green energy industry, the alleged corruption of local officials, and the nitty-gritty process of defeating wind development.
 


These Facebook pages have become powerful incubators of local political action. Members share community board meeting schedules, .pdfs of wind leases signed by landowners, plans to oust unsympathetic local politicians, and rubrics for the restrictive local zoning laws that can temporarily or permanently block wind projects. A report by the Center of the American Experiment, a conservative, free-market think tank that receives funding from fossil fuel interests, counted 317 US municipalities, from Shasta County, California, to Reno County, Kansas, that had “rejected” wind power, often through insurmountable requirements. Many of these “rejections” have associated Facebook community pages.But the effect of the pages goes far beyond blocking wind farms. In some places they have contributed to a culture of civic mistrust so profound that it has attracted the attention of sociologists. Their research has put the problem on a par with the breakdowns in communities that have suffered through enormous disasters like a chemical spill or a bridge collapse. A photo posted in August to an anti-wind community page for Madison County, Iowa, depicts two silhouetted figures raising their arms in triumph in front of a burning turbine. “We will celebrate!!! Death to industrial wind turbines MidAmerican Energy,” the caption reads. In Texas, a county commissioner who supported tax breaks for wind developments resigned after receiving threats that made him fear for his life. In Vermont, the chair of a town select board resigned after receiving a menacing note about his support for a wind project.And in Montcalm County, Michigan — home of Erik and Chantelle Benko — the planning commissioner for Pine Township resigned suddenly before an August 2021 special meeting over a proposed wind ordinance. After the meeting, the township chair explained to a reporter from the Greenville Daily News that the official had resigned because he was, well, getting “a hard time on the internet.”
 


After they started Montcalm County Citizens United, Erik and Chantelle Benko discovered that Apex Clean Energy had already signed leases in several of the county’s 20 townships, including their own. The state of Michigan comprises 1,240 such townships, local governments that have broad authority over planning and zoning. So while a developer may plan wind farms for a county, a project can be contested at a more granular scale. Neighboring townships can set completely different standards for wind, a fact that expresses itself dramatically as one drives through the state, from pastoral landscapes with no turbines at all to ones suddenly dominated by their swooping blades.So while the Benkos were starting from behind, there were multiple battlefields on which to fight. Chantelle reached out to friends and colleagues from her old job as a therapist at a prison in nearby Ionia. Erik drew on his degree in marketing. “I know enough about the algorithms to know you need regular posts with a lot of likes,” he told me. “You need at least one a day — ideally something that will drive clicks and engagement, including goofy memes. That’s what keeps the lights on some days.”Two people Chantelle Benko contacted immediately were Norm Stephens and Kevon Martis, a retired school teacher and a contractor, respectively, from the other side of the state. They are, as Benko put it to me, the “Luke Skywalker and Yoda” of opposition to industrial wind power in Michigan. Both men had helped defeat wind proposals in their own townships years earlier, and have moved on to helping other local anti-wind groups do the same. Martis gives presentations across Michigan about the alleged negative impacts of turbines. Stephens attends public meetings around the state urging townships not to move forward with wind developments without thorough research — research he’s happy, of course, to furnish. Only a few days after the Benkos started Montcalm County Citizens United, or MCCU, Stephens supplied a list of 32 “Negatives of Wind Energy,” which the Benkos then turned into a pamphlet. It included “NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PHYSICAL & MENTAL HEALTH,” “RED FLASHING WARNING LIGHTS,” “AESTHETICS: 600’ EYE SORES,” “BAT & BIRD KILLS,” and “MERCY FLIGHT INTERFERENCE.” Chantelle Benko posted it to the group. At the same time, she posted in MCCU that Martis would be available to take questions. Advertisement  Among his foes in the wind industry — who variously call him “he who shall not be named” and “K-Mart” — it is assumed that Martis is an agent of the fossil fuel industry, waging a faux-populist war against clean energy in the Upper Midwest; why else would one man tilt at so many windmills. They point to the sheer amount of travel he does, to townships around the state and to states around the region, as proof that he has a significant income source outside his day job. Martis claims that his anti-wind organization, the Interstate Informed Citizens Coalition, has received no donations from corporate energy interests and that he has lost money on his anti-wind work over the past decade. He categorically denies financial ties to the fossil fuel industry.Martis does hold the title of senior policy fellow at the Energy and Environment Legal Institute, a think tank funded by the Koch brothers and the coal industry that once strategized a national PR campaign against wind power. When he accepted the fellowship, Martis told me, he was having trouble getting Michigan newspapers to print his op-eds, and he thought the credential would help. He acknowledges that it gets Republican legislators to take him more seriously; he regularly testifies in front of the Michigan and Ohio legislatures. But he is adamant that he has no active involvement with the institute, which, he said, “has never asked me to do a single thing, ever.”When I asked Martis about the motivation behind his work, he told me that poor rural people deserve to fight wind developments with the same level of organization as rich people. He started to tell me a story about an old farmer who had asked for his help. Then he stopped and began to cry. “Most of these townships have 1,000 or 1,200 people in them,” he said. ”We don’t see development pressure from Fortune 500 companies, ever. Suddenly they come in with lawyers and engineers. As a Christian, my understanding of the Bible says if you have the means to help, you should.” Advertisement  Martis did not initiate the wind debate in Montcalm County, though he did try. His anti-wind organization posted on its Facebook page back in November 2019 that Apex was planning a development there. But it was only a full year later, after the “vested interest” post, that the Benkos started MCCU. And once it got going, local residents made the noise. Stephens and Martis chimed in frequently in the comments.The MCCU moved quickly from online organization to physical action, finding that many of the tactics for shaping a debate online applied to old-fashioned community politics. In a post on Nov. 8, 2020, only 10 days after starting the group, Chantelle Benko encouraged its members to make their presence felt at a Sidney Township board meeting the following day.”If you come to the meeting,” she wrote, “please highly consider voicing your OPPOSITION to these wind turbines coming into our area so the board members can hear our voices say NO TO BIG WIND!!! Looking out and seeing nodding heads doesn't carry nearly as much noise as they need to be hearing from us!!! YOUR SILENCE = CONSENT to those who are listening.” Advertisement  These meetings typically drew an audience you could count on the fingers of one hand, but on Nov, 9, 140 people showed up. Crowded under a wood pavilion at dusk, they listened to Albert Jongewaard, a senior development manager at Apex, speak for almost 90 minutes. Handsome and polished, Jongewaard extolled the benefits of revenue for participating landowners, a larger tax base, and, potentially, jobs for a county that had been hurting for them since an Electrolux factory closed in 2006. Then he began taking questions.
 


As dusk turned to dark, Erik Benko stood up, thrust his hands in his pockets, and stared at Jongewaard for several minutes as the rep spoke.“Is it just me or do those sound like shill questions?” he said, finally. Benko produced a piece of paper. “I’m going to read this, because I’m not as smooth a talker as this guy,” he said.“No one has the right to destroy the peace and serenity of nature in our lifestyle here. We do not want these things in our township, plain and simple,” Benko read, his voice rising in a flat Michigan accent. He called on the township board to “Say no to these things. Write an impossible ordinance for wind turbine placement and let’s all get back to living our lives in peace.” As he finished speaking, the pavilion erupted in cheers. It was like a small, local version of brigading, the online practice of swarming a contested topic in order to give the impression of unanimous public opinion.In the weeks after the meeting, MCCU took off. People from around the county joined: office managers, steel fabricators, court clerks, transportation maintenance workers, medical marjiuana marketers. So did sympathizers from other anti-wind groups throughout the country: Altamont, Kansas, and Knightstown, Indiana, and Nantucket, Massachusetts. Norm Stephens and Kevon Martis posted every day, or close to it. Albert Jongewaard became “Apex Albert.” Apex Clean Energy became “Apex Predators.” The Benkos started getting direct messages every day from people worked up about turbines. They were spending so much time answering questions from new members that they wrote a FAQ, and then rules for the group, like “Be Kind and Courteous,” and “No Foul Language.”But more importantly, Erik Benko told me, was a moratorium on partisan political discussion — no left versus right. The reasons people express for opposing wind projects span the political divide. In progressive communities, they tend to focus on the environmental impact, like the potential harm to bats and birds. In conservative ones, they tend to focus more on the alleged imposition of the liberal green agenda. Libertarian-leaning conservatives themselves, the Benkos didn’t want to risk alienating anyone opposed to Apex. Plus, they were so much less interested in national politics now. All they found themselves caring about was preventing wind turbines in Montcalm County.As winter moved in and COVID precluded in-person gatherings, township board meetings convened online, making it easy for MCCU members to attend meetings outside their own townships. Astonished officials and local reporters saw meetings swell to more than 100 participants. Unaccustomed to video calls and baffled by the sheer amount of anger in what had long been sleepy gatherings, officials grew frustrated and defensive. Recrimination and name-calling filled Zoom text chats.“The meetings were chaos,” Elisabeth Waldon, the news editor of the Greenville Daily News, told me. “Everybody had their video screen on and nobody knew how to mute.”“If audience members could refrain from asking fellow attendees in the Zoom chatroom, ‘everyone unmute and start talking’ in the middle of a meeting,” Waldon wrote in a Feb. 6, 2021, column, “that’d be helpful.”
 


The local mood had turned sour and then paranoid. At a January meeting of the Douglass Township planning commission, the chair reported that earlier that week a masked figure had come to his farm and dropped off a parcel of letters from citizens concerned about wind power. The chair compared the intrusion to “domestic terrorism.”“How do I know they didn’t go into our milk house?” he said. “They could’ve put poison into our milk.”The hysteria perhaps testified to just how quickly the activists had organized in a community completely unaccustomed to such intense advocacy. The Benkos built a separate website to share anti-wind resources and take donations. They signed up coordinators for almost every township and drew up plans to put several wind-friendly ordinances throughout the county to referendum. Signs now dotted lawns throughout the county. “Say No To Big Wind In Montcalm County!” read some. “2 Tall 2 Close 2 Loud” read others.On July 8, 2021, the Sidney Township board approved 4–1 an ordinance that forbade placing turbines within 3,000 feet of any road right of way, making it effectively impossible for Apex to build there. When the decision was announced in the township hall, cheers rang out and someone blasted a horn. Erik and Chantelle Benko had won. But the fight in Montcalm County was only starting.
 


Sociologists of disaster have historically distinguished between natural disasters and technological ones. The former are acts of God: earthquakes, eruptions, tornados. The latter are human-made: bridge collapses, nuclear meltdowns, oil spills. (More recently, floods, fires, and other disasters related to human-made climate change have complicated this dichotomy.) In the 1997 paper “Contamination, Corrosion, and the Social Order,” the environmental sociologist William Freudenburg argued that technological disasters can be far more damaging to social cohesion than natural ones. That’s for a few reasons: Someone is usually at fault for a technological disaster, a fact that encourages blame. The harm of a technological disaster is often ambiguous or difficult to quantify, encouraging differing interpretations. That ambiguity makes it hard to know when the disaster is over, encouraging a persistent state of perceived danger.“A pervasive uncertainty may be coupled with an intensification of residents’ need to act,” Freudenburg wrote. “In a case involving possible toxic contamination, there will often be no real way for anyone … to know how much toxicity is present, or was.”Social groups under this kind of stress fit into a model Freudenburg called “Corrosive Communities,” which are defined by three characteristics. The first is the perception of an ongoing threat to human health. The second is “recreancy,” a technical term in sociology that refers to the feeling that experts and institutions can’t manage the new risks created by technological development. The third is litigation. These characteristics feed on each other. A heightened perception of risk leads people to wonder why experts and institutions aren’t doing their jobs. A sense of recreancy tends to generate litigation. Litigation raises awareness of risk. Such communities may be harmed as much or more by the social dynamics that follow a technological disaster as they are by the disaster itself. Advertisement     Last year, Jeffrey Jacquet, a professor of rural sociology at Ohio State University, was part of a research team that applied the corrosive community model to two prominent anti-wind Facebook community pages in central Ohio, one in a county with a proposed wind project, and the other in a county that already had a wind farm. The authors coded 800 posts in the two groups for the three characteristic themes of a corrosive community. They found that around half the posts in both groups highlighted the theme of recreancy — distrust in government, scientists, and developers; that 40% of posts in one group and 24% of posts in the other concerned litigation (wind companies sometimes sue municipalities over restrictive ordinances); and less than 20% of posts in the two groups concerned health and physical effects. While posts about health were less common, members engaged with them more than any other kind of content.The authors concluded that the pages were highly effective at two things: building social connections among anti-wind groups around the country, and contributing to erosion of social bonds within the local communities themselves. In other words, not only did the Facebook pages themselves have these corrosive characteristics, but the people in them also appeared to be spreading these characteristics into their physical communities.
 


The research raises a question: If communities often corrode in the aftermath of a disaster, had there been a disaster in Montcalm County? Or was it possible to create a post-disaster community simply through the right kind of networked communication? In Montcalm County, there was certainly diffuse blame, harm that was difficult or impossible to quantify, and an atmosphere of persistent threat. That’s why Jacquet thinks it’s a mistake to dismiss what’s happening in places like Montcalm County as simple NIMBYism. These communities have been primed to perceive wind turbines as a vector of distress and disease.“A dripping faucet won’t hurt your eardrums,” Jacquet said. “There’s nothing in the dripping faucet that will physically harm you. You might not even notice it until someone points it out to you and tells you how pissed off you should be about it. However, given the right circumstances it could totally drive you crazy. Especially if you can’t control it, and someone else is making money from the drip. That could cause all sorts of issues.”
 


Jed Welder was raised on a corn farm in Sidney Township, which he left at 17 with no intention of coming back. He joined the Marines and eventually served as an Army Ranger in Afghanistan and Iraq. After two combat tours, he decided that he wanted to see something grow. So in 2008, he returned to the family farm, which he now runs. In 2014, he was elected to the Sidney Township board, replacing his former Sunday school teacher as the only farmer trustee.Welder’s first six years on the board had been largely uneventful. In 2019, like many other farmers in the county, he signed an exploratory development lease with Apex. His situation was relatively common. As longtime residents, farmers and descendants of old farming families frequently serve on township boards and planning commissions in Michigan, and because they own expanses of open land, they frequently attract wind developers. Anyways, it was his property, Welder reasoned, and he could monetize its resources as he saw fit. For five months there had been open county meetings about a potential wind project, but as ever, no one came. It just didn’t seem like a very big deal. Then, one night while unloading corn, Welder sent the text message (“Have a vested interest in this project.”) that would change his life.On a chilly morning this past October, I clambered into the cab of Welder’s John Deere combine. It was an impressively modern chamber: sealed tight, quieter than the inside of a moving sedan, and lined with touchscreens that displayed the corn yield in real time. Welder is an efficient person. He wanted to explain how he had become a villain to hundreds of people in the county where his family had lived for 50 years, but it was also harvest time. He wanted to double-task. Advertisement     Welder insisted the phrase he used in the fateful SMS, “vested interest,” referred not just to the income he stood to gain from a few turbines on his land, but from the potential tax benefits for the township — which, as a member of the board, he knew could use extra money for roads and sheriffs. Plus, Welder pointed out, the average land lease pays farmers less than $10,000 a year per turbine. On a farm like his, this amounted to a nice chunk of change, but hardly top-line income. The corn Welder had harvested while we were talking was worth $1,000 alone, he said.But Jeffrey Lodholtz, the planning commission member on the other end of the text, saw it differently: “Unethical as all get out,” he told me. Welder had thought of Lodholtz as something of a friend. Their children went to 4-H together, and Lodholtz had once come to Welder’s farm to shoot guns. But Lodholtz thought he was being bigtimed, a former officer leaning on a former enlisted man. (I asked why Lodholtz had posted the text on the internet rather than discussing it with Welder. He said he no longer thought he could trust anything Welder had to say.)Pulling clear of a field of corn stubble, Welder turned the combine onto a paved county road. After a few minutes, he pointed out a property festooned with yellow anti-wind signs: Erik and Chantelle Benko’s ranch. They were neighbors, and they had history: A petty dispute over whether Welder had stolen a cool-looking boulder from the Benkos’ property. Advertisement     When the Benkos started MCCU, Welder assumed some of the anger was due to this run-in. That was why, he thought, they had sicced the Michigan Townships Association on him — its attorney had advised him to recuse himself from any discussion of wind energy in his role as a trustee. That was why the Benkos had immediately put up dozens of anti-wind signs on the edge of their property line, across from Welder’s field. The farmer thought if he posted a straightforward note to the MCCU page that cooler heads might prevail.“My family has farmed here for half a century,” he wrote on Nov. 1, 2020. “I would never support anything that would have a negative impact on the place that we live and love... We all live here, we are all neighbors in a small township, I believe it's important that we are able to talk to each other, face to face and disagree without resorting to name calling and conspiracy theories.”
 


But the post seemed to make things worse. Comments under the note were suspicious, accusatory — and led by Norm Stephens, the prominent anti-wind activist.“I don't know Jed,” Stephens wrote. “His integrity might be A+...but his attendance and involvement at meetings will do nothing but create hard feelings and the destruction of the social fabric in your township.”The comments were also, Welder thought, slightly threatening.“Sidney Twp needs to become a very uncomfortable place to live for all these creeps selling out their neighbors,” read one.Several days later, Welder got in his F-150 and drove it to the road opposite the Benkos’ property. There, at the limit of his land, he posted signs touting the benefits of the Montcalm wind project. Then he planted a single pinwheel in the ground. He thought it was appropriate — a cheeky response to over-the-top vitriol. The Benkos did not. They captured Welder in action with a zoom lens and posted the photos to MCCU.
 


“Is this a THREAT to your constituents that you will place a turbine across the street from their (our) house if you get your way!?!?!?!?” Erik Benko wrote on the Facebook page.Somehow, things deteriorated further. Members of MCCU began to call on Welder to resign from the Sidney Township board. Welder’s children were harassed at softball games. Angry and scared, members of his family quit Facebook. On MCCU, people accused Welder of making up the harassment — gaslighting. Despite being advised by the Michigan Townships Association attorney from attending board meetings about the wind proposal, Welder logged into one under another name. In the comments section, he referred to Erik Benko as “little eric” and told Norm Stephens, zooming in from his house in the thumb of Michigan, to “go home.”
 


Meanwhile, the Benkos suspected that Welder had started a whisper campaign about them. (Welder denies this.) A rumor was going around Sidney Township that they had dug up a married couple who owned the ranch in the 1970s — they were buried on a single-acre property within the Benko ranch, along with their Great Dane and their prize bull, Bob — and moved their bodies. In fact, the dead and their animals had been excavated and relocated, but the Benkos had no idea why; the plot wasn’t even their land. To the Benkos, it was more proof that Welder had to go.In small municipalities, tiny voting blocs can have an outsize influence, which anti-wind groups have leveraged to great effect. In Michigan, a petition signed by one-quarter of the number of people in a township who voted in the previous gubernatorial election triggers a recall. In Sidney Township, 1,097 people voted in the 2018 election; Montcalm County Citizens United has 3,220 members. On July 8, 2021, the same day the Sidney Township Board voted for a restrictive zoning ordinance, Jeffrey Lodholtz created the Facebook page “Recall Sidney Township Trustee Jed Welder.” On Nov. 12, he submitted a recall petition, and started collecting signatures soon after.“Let's show these self-serving conflicted officials and Industrial Developers that we will not be bullied or sold to the highest bidder,” Erik Benko wrote in a post to MCCU. “*** THIS IS OUR HOME; OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY ARE THE PRIORITY AND OUR COMMUNITY IS NOT FOR SALE!!! ***”Sitting in the combine with Jed Welder, who is fighting the recall, I asked him about Erik Benko. Why did he think he was so angry? Benko, Welder told me, “works from home and is on the internet all day long.” Then he caught himself and smiled. The former Army Ranger said that he tried to keep in mind a line from Max Ehrmann’s prose poem “Desiderata”: “As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.”
 


Local anti-wind groups have all the tactical advantages of an insurgency. They live in the contested territory. They have deep social connections with the local population. They know which messages will resonate with them. They keep track of collaborators. They exert social pressure. And they are aided by the real enough perception that an outside force with massive resources has come to build and profit.In early October, the private equity behemoth Ares Capital Management announced that it had acquired a majority stake in Apex Clean Energy, a fact that was not lost on the MCCU.“‘Ares’... like the Greek God of War? ,” Erik Benko wrote under a post announcing the sale.According to Sarah Mills, a senior project manager at the University of Michigan’s Graham Sustainability Institute, wind energy companies have tended to collect leases first and worry about local opposition later. Recently, though, these companies have started working on a playbook to win hearts and minds. The Michigan Conservative Energy Forum — a clean energy lobbying group funded by wind developers and energy companies — has been dispatching conservatives throughout the Midwest to do dinner table diplomacy since 2018. But they usually show up too late. Advertisement     
 


“By the time we get a phone call, shit has already hit the fan,” Ed Rivet, the forum’s executive director, told me.On Nov. 10, 2020, 11 days after the Benkos created MCCU, Apex built a competing Facebook page for Montcalm Wind, which posts a few stories a week about the benefits of wind energy. As of November 2021, it had almost 500 followers. But the almost exclusively negative comments under the page’s posts suggest a lot of that traffic was hate-reading. Since the summer, Apex has held a series of open houses at the Montcalm Wind office space, where they distribute literature and answer questions. These are reliably picketed; one Apex employee who asked not to be named claimed that an MCCU member once went through the parking lot taking pictures of the license plates of attendees’ cars.When I visited the office recently, I was greeted by Albert Jongewaard, the polished Apex senior development manager who had been shouted down by Erik Benko at the Sidney Township meeting. Alone in the one-room building, he had the air of a diligent but slightly beleaguered colonial administrator. It was a hectic morning. Jongewaard was helping to organize a “health and safety” event that evening put on by the Michigan Conservative Energy Forum. He had just gotten word that one of the speakers, a neurologist and specialist in sleep medicine named Jeffrey Ellenbogen, had received a menacing text message from an anonymous number.“Get the FUCK out of our state,” it read, in part.Undeterred, the doctor showed up to the Montcalm County Fairgrounds that night, along with a farmer from a neighboring county who had turbines on his land (“They’re coming whether you like it or not”) and a sound acoustics expert via video conference. So did a dozen members of the MCCU, who unfurled a barn door–sized banner by the side of the road. As the event got underway, a few of the protesters filed into the back of the room, where they sat with crossed arms and stern expressions.Ellenbogen, whom Apex frequently flies to such events, stressed to the audience of several dozen people that the best available science showed no connection between wind turbines and negative health effects. Behind sensational stories of people suffering from living near wind turbines, he said, were usually another chronic health condition that had gone undetected. The acoustics expert explained how sound is measured, how decibel averages are calculated, how the dreaded “infrasound” of wind turbines is also produced by everything from ocean waves to moving cars. He agreed that turbines do make noise, the effects of which are a matter of perspective.
 


“They can be audible, and some people find them annoying,” he said. “Audibility is highly objective. Annoyance is highly subjective.”The point of the meeting was to put people’s minds at ease over wind turbines, and for people who are reassured by experts, it may have done just that. Apex thinks these sessions can reach what it believes is a nonvocal majority whose moderate opinions are obscured by the activism of groups like MCCU. But annoyance is indeed a subjective condition, the cure for which is rarely being told to chill out. The entire context of wind development in Montcalm County — from the stakes of the climate crisis to the fury of the MCCU to the clumsiness of Apex — was making people more aware of wind turbines and more sensitive to, well, just about everything. A digital infrastructure that runs on attention was at odds with a physical infrastructure that people, in some sense, will need to just tune out.And Montcalm County had reached a state of corrosive distrust. It had become an inflamed nerve.The antagonism seemed to be accelerating. Jed Welder suspected someone was investigating his service record. Members of the resistance had filed Freedom of Information requests to see if local townships had communicated with Apex. Lawyers for Apex had filed their own requests to determine if the Benkos, Kevon Martis, or Norm Stephens had colluded with the Sidney Township. Several townships were expecting litigation; wind companies have sued municipalities over similar ordinances for violating fair business statutes. I heard from a few residents who felt the anger and division over the potential construction of 75 wind turbines — machines that would bring some money to some people, maybe help pave the roads or pay for an extra sheriff, and play some tiny part in averting the climate apocalypse — were orders of magnitude stronger than they were during the 2016 or 2020 presidential elections.I asked Jeffrey Lodholtz, the township official whose post of Jed Welder’s text set off the entire ordeal in Montcalm County, what he thought about the events of the previous year. He told me he thought there had been “hogwash” on both sides of the wind fight, but that it had been good for the community, because it got people involved in local politics who had never paid attention to them before. It was good that people were showing up, good that people were debating, good that people were taking an interest in their community. All this concern had even reinvigorated the local paper, he pointed out — what could be a stronger sign of local democracy in action?Wind opponents frequently make a version of this claim, and there’s a certain logic to it. How do politics begin, in some sense, without people noticing their surroundings? Squint really hard and you could maybe even see in the raucous MCCU and its ilk something like one of the voluntary associations that Alexis de Tocqueville claimed made the United States unique, and great.But it was also true that in the case of the wind fight, as in the local fights over critical race theory and mask mandates, it was a particular type of association that kept forming, one with a kind of irritably conservative worldview. The underlying theme uniting these conflicts is the desire to preserve a romantic American vision, one of a society that doesn’t see race, for example, or one where individual action exists in a vacuum from collective responsibility, or one in which green farmland stretches unbroken into the horizon. That was the frequency of politics the MCCU and groups like it seemed to emit.The closest turbines to Montcalm County are a 20-minute drive due east from Greenville, outside Carson City. There, they tower silver-white over the electric lines, the old wooden farmsteads, and the roads, other human technologies that must have, at some time and to some people, seemed strange and even threatening. I parked my car at the edge of a field, about 500 feet from a turbine, got out, and sat on the hood. At first, I thought it sounded like a hair dryer on the high setting two rooms over — a noise that might require you to turn up the volume on the TV, but a noise you would almost certainly get used to. The longer I sat there thinking about the humming gears, though, the more I was sure I detected subtle changes in pitch and intensity. The noise started to sound more like a plane landing, or taking off, or somehow doing both at the same time, on and on. It sounded like an endless transition. It sounded like an action in search of a resolution. ●

309,"Multiple tornadoes touched down in several states last Friday, causing widespread destruction and leaving scores of people dead and injured.","


Nearly a week after several states were hit by a series of tornadoes, the level of destruction, which has been most severe in Kentucky, is still being assessed. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said that 3,280 people are still without power almost seven days later, mostly in the town of Mayfield. Hundreds of homes and buildings were destroyed in the storm, and at least 77 people in the state have died. We looked at some photos that show how the area is recovering after the devastation.

310,Brandons all over the world are now having to deal with the reality that their name is being used to insult the president of the United States.,"


When the comedy show’s host introduced Brandon Davidson onstage to perform at a company’s Christmas party last week in Wichita, Kansas, Davidson was met with yelling.The crowd full of construction workers started shouting, “Let’s Go Brandon,” a chant that conservatives have taken on to mean “Fuck Joe Biden.” The crowd chanted it for over a minute, Davidson told BuzzFeed News.“The mic was in the mic stand and I just stood there,” Davidson said. “My face was completely neutral and I just sort of let it wash over me.”Brandons all over the world are now having to deal with the reality that their name is being used to insult the president of the United States. After an Oct. 2 NASCAR race, when driver Brandon Brown was being interviewed by Kelli Stavast, an NBC Sports reporter, the crowd behind them began chanting “Fuck Joe Biden.” Either on purpose or by accident, Stavast suggested to Brown that they were cheering “Let’s Go Brandon” to support him. The mix-up turned into an inside joke for conservative groups and was picked up by elected Republican officials. Sen. Ted Cruz and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott both referenced it in tweets, and Republican Rep. Bill Posey said it on the House floor. The chant has even been turned into songs and appeared on clothing. Advertisement     Davidson, who first heard “Let’s Go Brandon” from an audience member at another comedy show a few months ago, said he tried to play it off at the Christmas party in Wichita with a joke.“I talked to one guy in the crowd and played ignorant, and was like, hey, what does that even mean?” Davidson said. “And the guy beside him was like, ‘Oh, it means ‘Fuck Joe Biden.’ And I was like, oh, very cool. But you’re a guy with a handlebar mustache — can’t you just say 'fuck Joe Biden'?”The phrase was also parodied in a Weekend Update segment on Saturday Night Live in November. Kyle Mooney, one of the cast members, played a guy named Brandon who is happy with all the attention until he realizes it’s not for him.Brandon Valentin, who lives in Portland, Oregon, said he had a similar experience.“I remember when I first saw it, I was like, ‘Hell, yeah, my name’s Brandon, let’s go — where are we going?’ Until I found out,” Valentin told BuzzFeed News.Valentin said he has seen a few half-ripped-off bumper stickers with the slogan on it in Portland, but when he lived in Phoenix, he saw plenty of flags hanging off pickup trucks with the phrase.He said it’s “frustrating” seeing his name used in that context because even though he identifies as liberal, he has his own critique of the president and did not want to be associated with an insult conservatives use against Biden.“It’s a dog whistle,” Valentin said about the phrase. “[People who use the phrase] know that they’re egregiously racist. They know they’re a hateful group of people and they don’t want to be perceived to be right-wing Nazis more or less by the general public.” Advertisement     Not everyone knows about the phrase and its meaning, however. When Valentin and Brandon Hsiu, another Brandon who lives in Los Angeles, both told friends about this interview, the friends didn’t know what they were talking about.“To be fair, my friend is a little more offline,” Valentin said. “I’m not surprised that he wouldn’t see that.”Brandon Meyer, who also lives in Los Angeles, doesn’t hear the joke too often except when friends from high school say something to him.“For certain people, I laugh and go, ‘Ha-ha, that’s funny, ass,’” Meyer told BuzzFeed News. “I just hate that it’s there.”Hsiu, who calls himself a “struggling” content creator, is only worried that the slogan might mess up the Google search results for his name.“I don’t really understand why conservatives have to use a coded name when they say they don’t like Biden,” Hsiu told BuzzFeed News. “For me and my friends, we are pretty progressive with our politics and we critique Biden all the time. … We don’t care about coding his name. We’ll just say it as is.”Brandon Boles, who works in customer service in Estes Park, Colorado, told BuzzFeed News that after the slogan began to gain traction in October, at least one customer per day would make a joke about it to him.“I don’t get too worked up about it,” Boles said. “I’m not super political, so I’m not really upset or excited that my name is linked to something like that.” ●

311,"Things that save you money, make you smile or look good, or just are fun? That’s a life hack, baby ","


Many days it seemed like just making it to the end of 2021 was the ultimate life hack. These are some of the tips that got the staff of BuzzFeed News through it. From the best place to buy jumpsuits (Old Navy, seriously), the Peloton coach that got us through it (Jess King), the sublime experience of keeping a dream journal, or just…. Piglets — we full-throatedly endorse these.Most of these life hacks are free, but just so you know, BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them.

Peloton coach Jess KingThree days into my Peloton trial and about 10 minutes into a ride that was clearly way too difficult for me, I was seconds away from giving up. And then, I swear to you, at the very moment I was going to step off the bike the instructor, Jess King, looked me dead in the eyes and said something like “Don’t you DARE. Don’t you dare give up. You can do it.” I don’t know why, because I am typically cynical about things like feeling the person in a workout video stream is speaking to me, specifically, but I listened and stayed on the bike. And I did do it. And six or so minutes later, when King told me to lean to the right if I was going to puke, I did that, too. That was more than 50 pounds ago. And while diet and mindfulness had a lot to do with me getting healthy, so did Jess King. Because she kept me biking, daily. How did she do that to an older guy in the worst shape of his life? Distraction. With the exuberance of a trick-or-treating kid in their best costume ever or the happiest person at a rave, King is fantastically, endlessly distracting — with or without the live DJ that sometimes accompanies her. She rides the bike like it’s a horse and her steady stream of direction is encouraging and surrealistically instructive. “Pretend you have gills in your armpits!” “Nipples over knees.” “Breathe through your back.” “Oops, I meant add 5.” “Here comes the shitshift!” And, yes, “Puke to the left.” She is the only coach who consistently makes me forget about my own discomfort long enough to keep exercising regularly. And to be clear, the discomfort is real, because King is a very good trainer — she’s just giddy and comfortably ridiculous enough to distract you from it. —John Paczkowski Advertisement  
 


Getting rid of your carAfter I moved to LA, I acquired a collection of business cards and notes that people left under my windshield wipers or in the driver’s window that basically said, “hey your car is a dump, let me buy it.” Then I moved to a neighborhood notorious for having the worst possible street parking in the city, and my problems escalated. My catalytic converter was stolen. Then I paid a lot to replace it and cover other repairs. Then, about a month later, it was stolen again. Then I paid a lot to replace it again and cover more repairs. Then I installed an anti-theft mechanism, surrendered, and handed the keys over to my dad and let him drive away with it. Advertisement  I bought my bike for $200 on Craigslist a decade ago and have probably spent five times that much on upkeep since then, which is still a fraction of how much it cost to own a car. I’d already relied on my bike for most trips, and the car had become redundant. I was only moving it once a week to repark and avoid tickets on street-sweeping days.I figured ridding myself of this turbulent beast would simplify my life. And it has. Now everything I own on this planet is inside my little shoebox apartment. I immediately stopped paying for gas, for parking, for tickets, for oil changes, for brakes and tires and catalytic converters, for Geico, for the AAA membership, for the little sticker on the corner of the license plate. But it’s also made getting groceries a drag. And getting anywhere takes a little longer when you’re on bike and public transit. And I’m rolling up to dates with helmet hair and drenched in sweat. And, without a trunk or backseat to store things, I’ve had to embrace being a Backpack-Wearing Adult.It’s complicated things, but it’s simplified things. I’m tethered to the city, but I’m liberated. —Emerson Malone
 


Telfar medium shopping bag — $202 on Telfar (sold out, but $150–200 on Poshmark)The Telfar medium shopping bag is perfect. Many people have extolled Telfar’s virtues and you don’t need me to go into it here, but what I did not know was that the medium bag is the perfect size. It somehow fits absolutely everything I need for all possible situations: my laptop, my water bottle, the old Glossier bag I throw my toothbrush and face wash into when I go to my boyfriend’s place, the giant copy of Dune I for some reason take everywhere with me lately, a bunch of old disposable masks I forgot about — you name it. The handles and straps mean it can be worn or carried in a bunch of different ways without killing my shoulders and/or neck, and it somehow goes with everything I wear. I’ve never really been a purse girl, but I’ve been converted. I haven’t touched my ratty old tote bags once since this baby was delivered. —Addy Baird
 


Getting full coverage car insurance — $XX/month (varies obviously) from HagertyI purchased a classic car in full almost two years ago while we were all stuck at home and public transportation was frowned upon. When I first got it, I was in a rush to get it onto the road and only insured it for liability. In the back of my mind, I knew I should probably get better coverage but kept putting it off. A few months ago, the East Coast got hit with the tail end of Hurricane Ida and experienced extreme flash flooding. My car was supposed to be safe at my mechanic’s, but it turned out that his shop was in an area susceptible to flooding. Long story short, all of his and his customers’ expensive classic cars were destroyed — except for mine. My car just so happened to be on the lift that evening. I took that as a sign to get full coverage because I don’t think I’ll get that lucky ever again. I sleep much better at night knowing I’m covered for its full value if something were to happen to it. —Derek Gardner
 


Homefield Apparel shirts — $32 at Homefield ApparelNot that anyone needs to wear college-themed apparel any more than we already do here in the US of A, but Homefield Apparel has a lot of great retro or retro-appearing logos on T-shirts for a variety of colleges (including, for example, the Naval Academy, North Carolina A&T, and Rice — it’s not just Alabama and Michigan, you know?). The T-shirts themselves are not the sturdiest I’ve ever owned and will run you more like $30 a pop, but they look great and are extremely soft, and frequently the first I reach for when going for a T-shirt. These also fall squarely in the “good gift for sibling” territory, if your sibling is looking for, say, George Washington dribbling a basketball in a ’90s style, or the LSU tiger dunking one. It’s also semi-interesting to compare different schools and get a good sense for which are needlessly tight with what kinds of uses of their branding they’ll allow. —Katherine Miller
 


Old Navy jumpsuits — $30–44 at Old NavyI’m not ashamed to admit that I’m the person that’s usually two to three years behind the curve. So, it wasn’t until this year that I discovered I absolutely adore jumpsuits. My gateway outfit was a hand-me-down from my mother: a neon pink jumpsuit, covered in light pink starfish, that she bought on a family trip to Hawaii in the early 1990s. Since then I’ve gone all in on the fad, most recently buying a couple of styles from Old Navy as a self birthday present: the smocked cami jumpsuit for women in a leopard print and Breathe On cross-front sleeveless jumpsuit for women in purple. (Note that the patterns available are constantly changing.) It’s not uncommon for me to wear both of these, perhaps more than once, in a week. They are soft, flattering, and, of course, have pockets, making them the go-to outfit for walking my daughter to daycare, sitting at home in front of my computer, or meeting work colleagues for drinks at an outside bar. —Zahra Hirji
 


Keeping a dream diary — $24 for BuzzFeed News’s notebook from AppointedMost of my dreams are innocuous and forgettable; these are the ones where I’m reading Slack and scrolling through Twitter, and it hurts my feelings that this is the best my nocturnal imagination can do. But sometimes there are the surreal stream-of-consciousness ones that mold my entire day. Not just the ones where my molars are falling out, but the ones where I’m skateboarding around the White House and running through an unbelievably beautiful meadow and babysitting a gross alien creature. That’s why I started keeping a running doc in my Notes app simply titled “weird dreams lately,” dedicated to the more twisted yarns, which are always a genuine delight to revisit.Chuck Klosterman wrote, “People who talk about their dreams are actually trying to tell you things about themselves they'd never admit in normal conversation. It’s a way for people to be honest without telling the truth.” So if that’s the case, what do I do with these:Nov. 26: Woodward and Bernstein are standing arm in arm on an elevated platform in a nightclub and singing something to the effect of “I ain’t never seen two pretty best friends / It’s always one of them gotta be ugly.”Dec. 11: An earthquake. The foundation of my condo’s building was tipping dramatically toward the street. I was holding onto a table for balance. The cats, Puck and Toby, were freaking out. Puck was standing on his hind legs trying to grab the air with both paws. All we could do was laugh.Dec. 21: I was performing in a play at my middle school at my current age. All the actors started to go off script. I got too comfortable and said the word “motherfucker” and everybody went silent and stared at me.Feb. 2: Someone kept using the phrase “that’s like putting braces on a scorpion.”Feb. 19: Dad and I visited a space museum run and operated by Mike Myers. We watched a video about efforts to extract petroleum on Mars and the voiceover sounded a lot like Dad. He wouldn’t admit that it was him. I asked Mike Myers who did the voiceover and he said it was Dad. —Emerson Malone
 


PigletsOut of all my attempts at mid-pandemic rejuvenation and despair mitigation, visiting a local farm with a bunch of piglets was by far the most effective. Piglets are a lot like puppies in that they are small, cuddly, and curious. But because they are pigs, they are arguably better. Their diminutive grunts and oinks? Their pristinely pink little noses and tiny ever-spinning tails? How ferociously, soothingly adorable. And how gently they pluck a piece of apple from your fingertips! It’s sort of the pig equivalent of a friend’s baby holding your finger. All this stuff makes a visit with piglets a killer pandemic poultice, an experience that will leave you giggling and obliterated for at least a few hours of the 18 months of the miasma of horror, idiocy, and anger we’ve all been living through. —John Paczkowski
 


Fabric face masks — $32 at BagguI struggled for so long to find a mask that not only fit my face but felt cute! These masks have a flap that covers your mouth, chin, and nose so they’re great for glasses wearers, too. I get so many compliments when I wear these! —Nicole Fallert
 


CheekfaceYou know those TV episodes where the plot can’t be resolved because one catastrophe leads to another? It feels like we’ve been stuck in one of those for half a decade, with the finale being isolation from friends and family for almost two years (The dumpster fire got bigger, now we need a bigger dumpster and a book of matches). But with the pandemic easing, I've been trying to get back to being human, and what's been helping me do that is the band Cheekface. (Here, let me explain how breathing works: You suck in and you continue to live).The LA-based trio of Greg Katz, Amanda Tannen, and Mark “Echo” Edwards specialize in tight, talk-sung indie tunes of wry hopelessness and hopeful wryness (It’s your best life if it’s the life that you’re living right now). With their two LPs (2019’s Therapy Island and 2021’s Emphatically No) and a smattering of singles, covers, and B-sides, they balance the boredom of living while the world burns and the joy of simply existing (Sometimes I wonder if there's a single good thing on earth. And then I eat Cinnamon Toast Crunch.). Advertisement     In early October, I was in a (masked, vaccinated) crowd indoors for the first time since the pandemic started, to catch Cheekface when they swung through NYC. It was a needed, personal reminder that crowds don’t have to be a threat. They can be a balm. (I liked it better when you were standing next to me.) —Brandon Hardin
 


Tarot cards — $17 at AmazonOne of the joys introduced to me this year was a new deck of tarot cards I received as a gift from a good friend. We sat on her sofa and each thought of something going on in our lives, drew a card, looked up its meaning, and thought intently about what it reflected about our personal state of affairs. We’ve all just quietly gone through so much in the pandemic. The answers, of course, lay in our interpretations, and the tarot cards can be a vehicle for self-reflection more than anything else. As we come out of a year spent in partial isolation, it was just more fun to do it with an old friend, laughing together and cheering on each other’s realizations made through a beautiful deck of divination cards. The answers we seek all lie in us anyhow, we just need some help getting to them, and a reminder that we’re not alone. —Venessa Wong Advertisement     
 


Used furniture from AuctionNinja.comAuctionNinja is an online estate sale auction site. It’s kind of like eBay, but with items grouped by individual estate sales, so typically a whole house’s worth of furniture and or other belongings. It’s a massive pain to buy stuff there, because you have to pick it up — in person — at a specific time window at the actual house over that weekend, or you forfeit payment! But because it’s such a pain, the prices…. My god, the prices.... They are just sublime. Advertisement     I moved this summer and needed some new furniture. My personal style has always been for vintage or thrift stuff, and with the supply chain issues happening I was hearing horror stories from friends waiting months for a West Elm couch to arrive. I paid under $1,000 for two matching couches in great condition from a fancy home in Greenwich, Connecticut (a friend helped load and move them). This is a site I almost hesitate to recommend because I don’t want too many people to find out about it and jack up the prices. It’s an amazing bridge between the random stuff on Facebook Marketplace/ Craigslist and a curated antique shop. —Katie NotopoulosOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News
"
312,"Kim Kardashian said she feels intimidated by her daughter North West: “I mean, North West is Kanye West’s daughter. Forget that — she’s his twin.”","You might be quick to assume that, being one of the most famous people in the world, it might be difficult to rattle Kim Kardashian. She’s the mogul at the helm of a multimillion-dollar empire — a mom of four with a passion for criminal justice reform on the side who documents the whole thing on her reality show just for fun. But when it comes to her being intimidated, there’s apparently only one person who can get under Kim’s skin. Enter North West. During a wide-ranging interview with Bari Weiss this week, Kim admitted that — despite having worked with Donald Trump in the White House — politicians are no match when it comes to her eldest child. “Who intimidates you?” Weiss asked in a quick-fire round of questions to wrap up the hourlong chat. Kim pondered the question to herself: “Who intimidates me?” “I was going to say politicians, but they don’t,” she replied. “Maybe just my daughter, North.” Now, if you're a fan of the Kardashians, then Kim’s response might not come as a surprise to you. But if not, allow me to explain. North is the eldest of Kim's four children, whom she shares with Kanye West. And while she may not boast as many entrepreneurial ventures as her parents yet, North has become somewhat of an icon herself. Whether or not you’re one of her 3.6 million followers on TikTok, you may have heard that the 8-year-old recently found herself in a spot of trouble after she went live on the app without the permission of Kim, who manages their joint account. Last week, North took it upon herself to treat her followers to an impromptu livestreamed tour of Kim’s mansion, which came to an abrupt end after she barged into her mom’s bedroom. “Mom, I’m live!” North can be heard announcing with a mischievous giggle as she bursts into the room. Kim — who was comfortably situated in her bed — immediately sits upright in a hurried attempt to end the livestream, demanding, “No stop, you’re not allowed to!” before turning to someone nearby for backup. Unsurprisingly, North quickly bid her fans goodbye and the livestream ended there and then. But that didn’t stop viewers from sharing recordings of the frenzied footage, which wound up going viral. After likely getting a scolding from her mom, North swiftly resumed posting to her TikTok account, which has gained over 1 million followers since the viral livestream. And so, North’s antics prompted a discussion about rule-breaking during Kim’s recent interview. The host, Bari Weiss, began by pointing out the irony in Kim’s response to her daughter’s mischievousness, noting that she didn't exactly play by the book in the earlier stages of her career. “The other day your daughter, North, went live on TikTok. She stumbled into your bedroom and she caught you in bed on your phone,” Weiss started. “I laughed and I couldn’t help but see the irony.” “You did all the things. You say you follow the rules, but come on, you broke so many of the rules,” she said, in a seeming reference to Kim’s not-so-conventional career path. Weiss proceeded to ask if Kim thought her eldest child might follow in her rule-breaking footsteps, especially in light of her newfound social media presence. “Watching her go live and [hearing] you say, ‘it’s not allowed,’ I asked myself: ‘Isn't it inevitable that she’s going to do with the newest media what you once did?’” she asked. In response, Kim shed a little more light on North’s outgoing personality and admitted that she takes after her father, who is certainly no stranger when it comes to pushing boundaries. “Absolutely. I mean, North West is Kanye West’s daughter. Forget that — she’s his twin. So she will still definitely do all of the above,” Kim quipped. But as we all know, breaking the rules doesn't come without its consequences, as Kim went on to reveal exactly what went down after North’s livestream fiasco. “In my household, there are rules,” Kim explained. “She did feel really bad about [going live], and she apologized to me and she said, ‘I saw on TikTok that I got in trouble and I’m really sorry.’ And she got it.” So, with North having seemingly learned her lesson, we’re glad to see that she is back in her creative stride producing lively TikToks for her followers — with the occasional cameo from her mom. All that remains now is a TikTok collab between North and Kanye — I, for one, have my fingers crossed."
313,"“She chose fraud over business failure,” Assistant US Attorney Jeffrey Schenk said during closing arguments.","


SAN JOSE, California — Prosecutors urged jurors on Thursday to be skeptical of claims Elizabeth Holmes made on the witness stand during her federal fraud trial, arguing that she could be misleading them just as she allegedly lied to keep the money flowing at her blood-testing company Theranos.“She chose fraud over business failure,” Assistant US Attorney Jeffrey Schenk said during closing arguments. “She chose to be dishonest with her investors and with patients. That choice was not only callous, it was criminal.”Holmes, 37, is accused of intentionally defrauding investors and patients by making misleading and false statements about the capabilities of her blood-testing technology, the company’s work with the military and pharmaceutical giants, and the accuracy of its test results. She is charged with nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud (a 10th wire fraud count was dropped after the judge barred a patient’s testimony due to an error by prosecutors). Each count carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison if she is convicted. Closing arguments are expected to continue on Friday. Advertisement     
 


Prosecutors have alleged that Holmes conspired with her ex-boyfriend Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, who was Theranos’s president and chief operating officer, to defraud investors as well as patients and doctors who used the company’s laboratory services. Balwani is facing the same charges as Holmes and is set to go on trial next month.Once hailed as the next Steve Jobs, Holmes had sought to revolutionize medicine with Theranos’s proprietary machine, which she claimed could run hundreds of tests on just a few drops of blood. The device was supposedly faster, cheaper, and more accurate than all other blood-testing lab equipment on the market and promised to bring critical diagnostics into drugstores, homes, and even battlefields. But as a Wall Street Journal investigation revealed in 2015, in reality, the machine could run only a small number of the tests, and its results were rife with inaccuracies. Instead, Theranos relied on commercially available machines to run the majority of its tests, diluting the drops of blood to increase volume for some tests and using much larger samples drawn from patients’ arms for others.Over the course of 11 weeks, prosecutors presented emails, text messages, documents, audio recordings, and video clips of Holmes speaking in interviews, along with testimony from former employees, investors, doctors, and patients to make the case that she was painfully aware of problems with the company’s technology and yet deliberately — and repeatedly — lied to get money in the door. Advertisement     During closing arguments, Schenk broke down the testimony and evidence that the government presented at the trial, detailing the specific emails, text messages, documents, and audio recordings the jury could use to satisfy every component of each charge, like that Holmes was privy to the alleged scheme and intentionally defrauded by knowingly sharing false information.“You can conclude that there is no witness who testified in this case that has more bias, [is] more interested in the outcome of the proceedings than the defendant herself,” Schenk told the jurors Thursday.
 


In her defense, Holmes’ legal team portrayed the former CEO as a businessperson who worked diligently for years to make lab testing cheaper and more accessible. She took the stand for seven days. Despite admitting that she had made several mistakes along the way — and ultimately failed to disrupt healthcare as she set out to do — Holmes testified that she believed her company’s technology worked.“That was fundamental and central to her thinking when she [went] out to make public statements,” Holmes’ attorney Kevin Downey said during closing arguments. He added that Holmes was told that Theranos’s technology would someday “be capable of performing any blood test.”At times, her testimony contradicted the government’s evidence, what other witnesses shared with the jury, and her own previous statements. For instance, several witnesses — including former Safeway CEO Steven Burd and Lisa Peterson, who handles investments for the DeVos family — testified that Holmes had told them or led them to believe Theranos’s devices were being used by the military. But the company’s equipment was never deployed in medical helicopters or on the battlefield, Holmes confirmed, even as she disputed that she had ever told anyone that.""My testimony is, I don't think I said that,"" Holmes told the jury when asked about the claim during cross-examination, the Journal reported.Holmes also admitted that she gave journalist Roger Parloff inaccurate information for his 2014 Fortune magazine cover story titled “This CEO Is Out for Blood,” which prosecutors alleged she had used to attract investors. When Holmes claimed that she didn’t remember sending the article to investors, Leach showed her and the jury a June 12, 2014, email in which she sent shareholders a link to the story. Advertisement     “I think I could have handled those communications differently,” Holmes said, according to CNBC.And in one of the most stunning admissions she made on the stand, Holmes said she personally added the logos of drug companies Pfizer and Schering-Plough to reports shared with potential business partners and investors without the pharmaceutical giants’ permission. Prosecutors alleged that Holmes doctored the reports to give the false impression that the companies had endorsed Theranos’s devices.""This work was done in partnership with those companies, and I was trying to convey that,"" she testified, according to the Journal. Holmes denied that she was trying to suggest that the companies had signed off on Theranos’s work. ""I wish I had done it differently,” she said.Downey tried to downplay the snafu in closing arguments Thursday, arguing that the government’s focus on the logos was a distraction and that the full story paints a different picture of the former CEO’s state of mind.Downey said that the drug company witnesses who testified about the reports did not convey any “negative feedback” to Holmes and that when sharing the reports with potential investors, she provided them with contact information so that they could speak with the pharmaceutical partners about Theranos’s work.“Ms. Holmes has no intent to deceive people or hide from people things that are going on in those relationships contrary to the government's assertions,” Downey said.He added that while the prosecution suggested that Pfizer stopped working with Theranos after that report, representatives for the company continued conversations with Holmes’ company into 2015. Downey also noted that the government failed to mention that Theranos had successful partnerships with several other pharmaceutical companies, like AstraZeneca.“The picture can change quite a good deal as a result of waiting for the full story and looking through the full material,” Downey said. He argued that at times prosecutors had presented an event that “looks bad,” but added, “At the end of the day, when all the evidence flows together, it isn’t so bad.”But Robert Weisberg, a criminal law professor at Stanford, told BuzzFeed News that Holmes’ admission that she added the logos of drug companies to Theranos reports without their permission was an important moment in the trial, calling her explanation “absurd.”“It’s almost as if she was really saying, ‘I didn't mean it to mean what it obviously meant,’” Weisberg said. “That's simply not credible.”
 


Reporters in the courtroom described Holmes as mostly calm, confident, and at times smiling while she testified. It was only when she shared that she had been raped as a student at Stanford University and detailed her relationship with Balwani, who was nearly 20 years her senior, that she became emotional. Through tears, she said that he had often criticized her, controlled her daily schedule and what she ate, isolated her from her family and friends, and forced her to have sex with him when she didn’t want to.“He told me I didn’t know what I was doing in business, that my convictions were wrong, that he was astonished at my mediocrity, that if I followed my instincts I was going to fail and that I needed to kill the person I was to become what he called ‘a new Elizabeth’ that could be a successful entrepreneur,” Holmes said, according to CNBC.Still, Holmes testified that Balwani did not have control over her communications and interactions with investors, journalists, and business partners, reinforcing prosecutors’ argument — and the image she put forth to the public — that she was ultimately in control of what happened at Theranos.When asked by one of her attorneys what impact her relationship with Balwani had on her work at Theranos, Holmes testified that she didn’t know.“He impacted everything about who I was, and I don't fully understand that,” she said, according to the Journal.Balwani’s attorneys have denied her allegations, saying in court papers that the accusations are ""devastating personally to him.”Downey has not yet addressed Holmes’ testimony about abuse or the impact it may have had on her during her time as CEO, but the defense’s closing arguments are ongoing.Court documents unsealed in August indicated that she might use her claims of abuse in her defense. Along with Holmes' own testimony, her attorneys also considered introducing evidence from a clinical psychologist regarding “a mental condition bearing on guilt.” According to the documents, the expert on “interpersonal violence” could have testified to whether her relationship with Balwani “was consistent with intimate partner abuse,"" a dynamic that can affect “its victims’ agency.” Advertisement     But Holmes’ legal team opted not to call the expert to the witness stand, leaving the jury with only the former CEO’s testimony on the issue.On Thursday, Schenk took a moment to address Holmes’ testimony about her relationship with Balwani, telling jurors that this case was not about whether Holmes was a victim of abuse.“If you return a verdict of guilty, you are not saying we the jury do not believe Ms. Holmes’ claims of abuse. If you return a verdict of not guilty, you are not saying we the jury believe Ms. Holmes' claims of abuse,” he said. “The case is about false statements made to investors and false statements made to patients.”

314,The San Francisco Police Department has blocked the public from listening to practically all of its radio transmissions.,"


For the first time since implementing radio technology in the early 20th century, the San Francisco Police Department has begun encrypting practically all of its radio transmissions, making them inaccessible to the public.SFPD confirmed the move to BuzzFeed News, explaining it had rolled out a new encryption protocol on Monday in compliance with a California Department of Justice mandate to protect personally identifiable information (PII).Police scanner hobbyists were the first to clock the change. Desmond Crisis, a technologist based in San Francisco, noticed this week that the police scanners he usually listens to had gone silent. Crisis likes to monitor local police channels for nearby incidents and threats to public safety. But now, the majority of police transmissions have disappeared behind a wall of encryption. Advertisement     
 


“Effectively all police department traffic will be encrypted,” Adam Lobsinger, an SFPD spokesperson, told BuzzFeed News on Thursday. “Almost no police radio traffic will be heard, and what is left unencrypted is going to be on the Department of Emergency Management side.”The city’s Department of Emergency Management (DEM), which routes 911 calls to police or fire units, is also developing a protocol for encrypting certain radio transmissions, though some DEM dispatches may remain unencrypted. Communications between SFPD and DEM could previously be heard on scanners; now, the public is no longer privy to the law enforcement side of those exchanges. The DEM has not yet responded to a request for comment.SFPD’s use of widespread encryption has barred hobbyists like Crisis — as well as journalists and audio platforms that broadcast police streams — from monitoring even standard police operations. It is part of a growing trend among US law enforcement that worries government transparency advocates about the consequences of a less visible police force. Police in Illinois, Minnesota, Virginia, and other states have recently encrypted their radio communications to some degree. Privacy law experts say that blanket encryption is an extreme response to perceived threats, and that police radio traffic is a necessary public resource.“These radio transmissions are an important window the public has into what police do,” David Snyder, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, told BuzzFeed News.SFPD previously framed the coming encryption of its radio feeds as a partial measure, and not the effective blocking of all radio traffic. In May, Sgt. Michael Andraychak told Palo Alto’s Daily Post that the select encryption of PII would be “sort of striking a balance.”The agency stated in a June media advisory that it is “committed to transparency as the law allows and will be fulfilling the public’s interest by not encrypting all of [its] channels.” To limit the transmission of PII, the agency would encrypt portions of radio traffic containing sensitive information, including discussions of sexual assault and domestic violence.Scanner hobbyists on radio forums and subreddits first noticed the change, with many worrying about its potential to undermine police transparency at a time when distrust in the police is running high. They have been tracking the department’s shift from an analog radio system to a digital one in November. SFPD replaced its 20-year-old system with a newer version that provides wider coverage and clearer audio and conforms to interoperability standards.
 


“Public safety information is public by nature,” Crisis told BuzzFeed News.The disappearance of police channels was also noticed by the controversial crime watch app Citizen, which relies on these transmissions to populate its app with breaking incidents. BuzzFeed News confirmed with the company that police dispatches were no longer appearing on the app in the San Francisco area. At the time, a Citizen spokesperson believed it to be a glitch.“We’ve reached out to law enforcement regarding the glitch in public access to radio transmissions in San Francisco,” the spokesperson said. “We’re looking forward to collaborating with them to ensure that news outlets and safety technology like Citizen keeps people informed about safety in the city. Rapid access to information saves lives and helping make that content relevant, factual and easy to access is core to our mission.”
 


When asked about transparency concerns, Lobsinger directed BuzzFeed News to the California Department of Justice, which he said authored the new encryption rules. A DOJ spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that PII ""must be protected when it is disseminated by law enforcement over the radio,"" and that law enforcement can do so through policies that selectively secure sensitive information but allow other radio traffic to continue.In the past year, several other California police departments have also encrypted their radio transmissions in accordance with the DOJ mandate. The statewide rule gave law enforcement agencies two options: fully encrypt their radio channels or selectively encrypt the dissemination of PII. (In California, PII is defined as an individual’s first name or initial and last name in combination with other data, such as a Social Security or driver’s license number.)SFPD is the second-largest police department in California, reporting 2,100 employees in December, and appears to be the largest in the state to have encrypted all of its radio traffic. (The LAPD, California’s largest police department, appears to only partially encrypt sensitive communications.)Among California law enforcement, the move to encrypted radio traffic has been staggered. The Daily Post reported in July that some agencies had struggled to implement the new policy change, citing issues like a lack of compatible radio equipment. Police in other cities, however, applied the encryption mandate swiftly and without notice. The Palo Alto Police Department began encrypting its radio channels in January, notifying only the news media and without public input. In April, Palo Alto residents criticized the new lack of transparency after a police officer sicced his service dog on a man wrongly identified as a kidnapping suspect.Experts question the ultimate outcome of police radio encryption and who it actually protects. Jake Wiener, a domestic surveillance law fellow at EPIC, likened police transmissions to the public’s right to record and broadcast law enforcement activities, noting that documentation of police activity on smartphones has been a powerful driver of anti–police violence movements.“The majority of information conveyed over police scanners is about the police,” Wiener told BuzzFeed News. “It’s much more of a roadblock to police accountability and community defense than any meaningful privacy protection.”

315,Clearview AI has built its business by scraping people’s photos from the web and social media and indexing them in a vast facial recognition database.,"


Facial recognition company Clearview AI has been hit with another order by a country’s watchdog agency to delete the personal data of its citizens, the latest in a global rebuke by privacy regulators around the world.On Thursday, France’s Commission Nationale Informatique et Libertés (CNIL) said Clearview had breached Europe’s overarching data protection law, known as GDPR. It gave the company two months to delete the personal information it had collected and stop “unlawful processing” of the data. Advertisement     The order comes after similar decisions from the UK and Australia in recent weeks. Clearview has built its business by scraping people’s photos from the web and social media and indexing them in a vast facial recognition database.The crackdown follows a series of BuzzFeed News investigations revealing widespread and sometimes unsanctioned use of the company’s facial recognition software around the world. In August, BuzzFeed News reported that France’s Ministry of the Interior is listed as having run more than 400 searches on Clearview, according to the facial recognition company’s internal data. Despite the records, a spokesperson for the agency at the time said it had no information on Clearview.The Crimes Against Children unit of Interpol, an international police force based in Lyon, France, had tallied more than 300 searches, according to Clearview data. “A small number of officers have used a 30-day free trial account to test the Clearview software,” the unit said at the time. “There is no formal relationship between INTERPOL and Clearview, and this software is not used by INTERPOL in its daily work.”France’s CNIL on Thursday said Clearview had committed two breaches of the GDPR: One violation was for the collection and use of biometric data “carried out without a legal basis.” Another was for a “lack of satisfactory and effective consideration” in requesting access to people’s data. Advertisement     In response to the claims, Clearview AI CEO Hoan Ton-That argued that his company isn’t bound by Europe’s data regulation law. “Clearview AI does not have a place of business in France or the EU, it does not have any customers in France or the EU, and does not undertake any activities that would otherwise mean it is subject to the GDPR,” he said in an emailed statement.Clearview has also received blowback in other parts of the world. Last month, the UK’s national privacy watchdog warned the company that it faces a potential fine of £17 million, or $23 million, for “alleged serious breaches” of the country’s data protection laws. The same month, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) demanded the company destroy all images and facial templates belonging to individuals living in the country.

A man who applied to join the Proud Boys was sentenced Thursday to 33 months in prison after he threatened the life of then-Sen.-elect Raphael Warnock ahead of the Capitol riot in January 2021.Eduard Florea used the social media app Parler to issue the threats against elected officials, trying to gather others to join him before the Jan. 6 insurrection, when a mob of supporters of then-president Donald Trump stormed the Capitol.

317,Mask mandates are being reinstated in some states. There are long lines for testing in others. The latest COVID-19 surge in the US feels like we haven’t learned anything.,"


Here we go again.As Americans endure their second pandemic winter, for many the holidays suddenly have an eerily familiar sense of uncertainty and foreboding. Mask mandates have been reinstituted in some places. There are long lines for testing in others. Booster shot appointments are filling up fast. Social media feels overrun with friends and loved ones announcing positive diagnoses. Cases are rising nationwide. Many hospitals are overrun. The US is girding for yet another deadly wave of COVID infections — its fifth or sixth, depending on where you live. Advertisement     “It’s just another wave. Any additional wave is too many,” said virologist Angela Rasmussen, who prefers not to keep count. “I’m tired of waves! I want to leave this beach!”Like millions of Americans, Rasmussen and her husband are now reevaluating their Christmas plans. At this stage, she’s still comfortable with the family gathering she had organized with other vaccinated loved ones who have received their booster shots, but she’s already thinking she’ll skip getting drinks with friends when she visits her hometown for the holidays.“I think at this point I’m just exhausted. Probably most people are,” she said. “Every time this happens, it’s like, Oh no, you got too hopeful there for a minute. Then something else happens. First Delta, now Omicron. It feels like we’re going through the same cycle.”“What’s most frustrating,” she said, “is that we don’t seem to be learning from it.”
 


New cases and hospitalizations are up week over week by about 5%–7%, the CDC said in a Wednesday briefing. Roughly 1,100 Americans are still dying each day. More than 90% of the country is considered an area of high transmission, and with cases of the highly infectious Omicron variant already located in 36 states, the forecast is only expected to worsen. The current surge is still largely driven by the Delta variant in most of the country.The CDC said it predicts that COVID cases will have further exploded as Americans gather for the holidays. It estimates as many as 1.3 million new infections will be reported in the week ending Dec. 25 — a potential 55% spike over the previous week. Looking to exploding case numbers in the UK as a potential model, January could be even more horrendous.The fact that these grim predictions arrived the same week that the US topped both 50 million infections and 800,000 deaths only seems to add to the sudden sense of increasing dread.
 


Facing this expected avalanche of yet more death, burned-out healthcare workers aren’t sure how they’ll cope. “Honestly, I don’t know how I’ll do that. I don’t know how we’ll keep going,” said Kansas physician Alix Oreck through tears. “We have none of the confidence that we initially did. We know the chances are so slim once people get to us that they’re gonna make it.”In the past month, things had already been getting markedly worse at her small 45-bed hospital in Parsons, a rural town in the state’s southeast where Oreck said it feels like people are pretending the pandemic is over. She recently initiated an ethics and allocation committee in order to make decisions about prioritizing patient care. They’re out of beds, IV poles, and other basic supplies. There’s just one ventilator left. These are not the kinds of decisions Oreck went into medicine to make. Advertisement     “We’re exhausted. We’re trying so hard. We’re trying to be generous of spirit even as we’re getting pummeled on all sides,” Oreck said. “But I have never seen healthcare workers cry so much. Everyone is hurting so much.”
 


A number of factors have converged at an unfortunate point in the pandemic. Cold weather has once again forced much of the US inside, and people are gathering for the holidays — far too many of them unvaccinated. Now, the Omicron variant has arrived on top of the already circulating Delta variant, which still comprises 96% of recorded US cases. But Omicron seems to be more contagious, even among vaccinated people. Even office holiday parties at companies with strict vaccine mandates have been followed by a spate of infections, including at BuzzFeed’s own in New York City. Omicron is likely to be the dominant variant across the country by early January.“It’s spreading like wildfire, even among vaccinated people,” Rasmussen said. “One thing is really clear: We’re gonna have a huge surge in Omicron cases. What’s going to determine how bad it’s going to be is how severe the disease will be and whether it will cause that in vaccinated people.”Some preliminary studies suggest Omicron cases are more often milder ones, but even if that holds true — a big if, as experts agree much more data is needed — its effect on hospitals could be easily counteracted depending on its spread. “If twice as many people get Omicron than Delta, but only half as many get severely ill, that’s still the same amount of severely ill as in a Delta wave,” Rasmussen said.

But all is not without hope. The world looks very different now than at this point last year, when COVID vaccines began rolling out of factories and into the first Americans’ arms. Scientists have developed new tests, treatments, and lifesaving vaccines. “It’s important to remember that we have far more tools to fight this virus than we ever did just one year ago,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters Wednesday.Gerardo Chowell, a mathematical epidemiologist at Georgia State University’s school of public health, said people in his Atlanta community aren’t postponing travel plans or holiday gatherings. They’re just being sensible. “People are ready to go on with their lives while managing COVID-19 risks,” he said. “I feel calm and optimistic. We have learned so much about this new enemy over the last two years and have reliable tools to mitigate the COVID-19 risk.”According to experts, there is one clear step Americans can take to protect themselves — and society at large — during this next wave.“The message remains clear: If you are unvaccinated, get vaccinated,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told reporters Wednesday. “And particularly in the arena of Omicron, if you are fully vaccinated, get your booster shot.”Fauci pointed to emerging studies showing vaccinations still offer considerable protection against severe disease caused by Omicron. Booster shots offer even more so. “Our booster vaccine regimens work against Omicron,” Fauci said. “At this point, there is no need for a variant-specific booster.” Advertisement     
 


So how should Americans navigate these next few weeks and make decisions about holiday festivities?Ashish K. Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told the Today show on Thursday that, unlike last year, there are now ways to gather safely with loved ones.“If everyone is vaccinated and boosted, I think it’s pretty safe for people to get together,” he said. “But if there are people who are high risk — elderly, immunocompromised — I would definitely add a layer of testing to that. Everybody just get a quick rapid test before they get together. It'll make it that much safer.”“If you’re mixing vaccinated and unvaccinated people, obviously it increases the risk,” Jha added. “There, testing becomes essential.”Virologist Rasmussen echoed this caution.“Don’t cancel Christmas, but maybe don’t invite over 50 people,” she said. “Don’t go to a party where your anti-vax relatives are hanging out. Be selective about who you’re with. Don’t be afraid to ask their status. Use rapid tests. Wear masks in public places.”After the last two years, it’s understandable to want to be with loved ones and eke out some sense of normalcy, Rasmussen said.But if there was ever a time to think of others, it’s now.“It’s the holiday season. We should be thinking about our communities, our families, and those who may be more vulnerable,” she said. “Please think about them before you decide you’re not going to let Omicron ruin your Christmas.” Advertisement

318,Jason Isbell’s choice to feature seven Black women opening for him in one of country music’s most revered venues felt like a small revolution.,"


When you’re standing in front of the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, you might feel under siege. It sits a few feet away from Nashville’s rowdy Broadway strip, which means you have to wade through an army of bros and bachelorettes — folks who descend upon the city for a good time, if your idea of a good time is throngs of partyers in matching outfits, open-top buses aggressively blasting music, and more country cover bands per square inch than you can possibly count.In sharp contrast to the loud nostalgia cosplay that surrounds it, the 2,300-seat auditorium, with its imposing Victorian Gothic architecture and distinctive stained glass windows, projects dignity and history. It’s one of music’s holiest sites, a storied hall that has been dubbed the Mother Church of Country Music. Everyone from Bruce Springsteen to Willie Nelson has a reverence for it. Word is Harry Styles once planned a whole tour just so he could perform here.In mid-October, I arrived for the second show of Jason Isbell’s eight-night residency at the auditorium. The occasion is a perfect marriage of artist and venue: Isbell is one of America’s most potent songwriters, and the Ryman is a cathedral of song. For Americana fans, the singer-songwriter’s annual residency here has become a coveted pilgrimage. It’s for good reason that Isbell has come to be associated with the Ryman: In 2015, he played four consecutive nights backed by his band, the 400 Unit. He expanded this to six in 2017. In 2018, he did another six and released a live album called Live From the Ryman. In 2019, Isbell and his band performed at the venue for seven shows. This year, they’re doing eight. Every single one of these runs has sold out.But if the Ryman has become a kind of home for Isbell, this year’s residency carried a different energy. It was historic. For seven of the eight evenings, he had a different Black woman opening for him. In an industry and genre that is consistently failing white women and is downright hostile to Black women, the choice to feature these openers is a small revolution.The openers vary in age, fame, and career stages. Between them, they cover a variety of genres under the roots music umbrella, ranging from country to soul, blues to folk, Americana to rock ‘n’ roll. For many of them, it was their first time playing the Ryman at all.
 


Perhaps the most recognizable name on the list is Mickey Guyton, a Nashville veteran who earlier this year became the first Black woman to be nominated for a solo country music Grammy. Guyton’s career is the perfect representation of how country’s corporate machinery regularly silences Black women. After weathering a decade of her label’s attempts to slot her into an R&B box, she stood her ground. Finally, in September, Guyton released her debut album, Remember Her Name. (“Thank God that Black don’t crack,” Guyton, who is 38, told me with a giggle. “Because I’d be screwed.”)Isbell’s decision to feature seven Black women is notable in any year, but in this particular moment, it feels like a necessary course correction. Earlier this year, the country music industry was rocked by scandal after Ring camera footage leaked of rising star Morgan Wallen drunkenly shouting the n-word.Wallen was dropped by his booking agent, and the all-powerful country radio stopped playing him. But a few months later, he is now sort of on parole, and radio stations are receptive to a new single. He’s rolled out a tour schedule after months of being MIA. The evidence suggests the appetite for forgiving Wallen is healthy. Advertisement  When I first talked to Isbell on the second night of his Ryman residency, he seemed bothered by the relatively minor consequences that Wallen had faced. “I think it’s hilarious that people assume that making somebody less famous is like cutting their fucking dick off!” Isbell said. “We’re not calling for the man’s head! We’re just going, ‘This guy is an idiot. And he does not deserve to be put on a pedestal. So let’s take him off the pedestal and put him back down on the sidewalk with everybody else.’ That’s all anybody asked for.” (A publicist told BuzzFeed News that Wallen is unavailable to comment.)This directness is not a common position in country music. Most performers have chosen to stay quiet, keep their head down. It has mostly fallen on women — Black women, in particular — to point out the ways the industry has overlooked racism. But then again, Isbell, 42, is far from the common figure in Nashville. Over the last decade, he has earned a reputation for being a straight shooter, a no-bullshit writer and performer, a mutineer with a microphone.
 


Isbell has long been waging war against the way nostalgia has been weaponized. He has grown intolerant of the levels of racism and sexism entrenched in the industry. A white Southern man from Alabama, he is resentful of the ways a fictitious version of the past has been deployed to keep people like him — “white Southern rural men,“ in his words — from seeing how things really are.But this story is only a little bit about Jason Isbell. If Isbell does his job right, it’s not about him at all. It’s about what happens when white men attempt to unhook themselves from the tentacles of nostalgia and engage with the world as it is, not as they’ve been told it is. For the next week at the Ryman, it’s about cultivating a different vision of roots music in all its iterations. The only thing you have to kill is something that never existed in the first place.
 


Jason Isbell made three albums with the Southern rock band the Drive-By Truckers, then he made three albums after that, then he got noticed about a decade ago. Actually, that’s not quite true: First he got sober, then he got noticed. His fourth solo album, 2013’s Southeastern, is his breakthrough album — certainly commercially, but definitely critically. Isbell set a new standard for vivid songwriting on Southeastern, from the lonely anthem “Traveling Alone” to the weeper “Elephant.” In 2020, when Rolling Stone revised its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list, Southeastern entered the list at No. 458. The album’s opener, “Cover Me Up,” has morphed into Isbell’s crowning achievement and his most famous song. Isbell wrote it in a very specific context — his own painful journey to sobriety — but it has become a timeless song about redemption.From there, things took off. Over the next three albums — two of them with the 400 Unit — Isbell won four Grammys. He became a mainstay at the Americana Music Honors & Awards, with more than a dozen nominations in half a decade. He became renowned for his songwriting prowess, and his ability to crystallize a feeling, a tension, a scene. Perhaps that’s why Bradley Cooper tapped him to create one of the songs for his adaptation of A Star Is Born — Isbell wrote “Maybe It’s Time.”Like the best of Isbell’s work, “Maybe It’s Time” is a mournful, layered song that’s subversive and playful, too: The music sounds nostalgic and wistful, but the lyrics implore you to “let the old ways die.” The gentleness of the song disguises its ask, but at its core, it’s an invitation to do away with your rigid perspectives. Advertisement  It’s not a surprise, then, that Isbell doesn’t do elephants in the room. (He has been outspoken about vaccine requirements at his concerts, earning some fans’ ire. Some declared they’ll never see an Isbell show again. “Sounds great!” he responded.) At least that’s the sense I got when he first walked into the small dressing room a few steps from the Ryman stage during our interview. This is someone who has little tolerance for vague small talk, preferring to get to the heart of the matter. So when I asked how he decided to have seven different Black women opening this Ryman run, there was a hint of exasperation in his voice. “First of all, I just love the music these women make,” he said. The choice of openers was neither some performative move nor an after-school special. “None of these people should be available to open for me,” he added. “They should all be too big for that.”
 


The breadth of talent opening for Isbell in this run is extraordinary. As is tradition, the first night of every Isbell Ryman residency is reserved for his wife, Amanda Shires, an award-winning singer-songwriter with piercing specificity, who also founded the country supergroup the Highwomen and plays fiddle in Isbell’s band. In addition to Guyton, there’s also Brittney Spencer, the breakout country singer who burst onto the scene about a year ago with her transcendent voice and skillful songcraft; Allison Russell, whose solo debut Outside Child was released in May and is one of the year’s best albums; Amythyst Kiah, who should be a household name by now; Adia Victoria, who deftly subverts a listener’s idea of what modern blues should sound like while breaking their heart; Shemekia Copeland is blues royalty, with seven Blues Music Awards to her name; and Joy Oladokun, whose career has finally been accelerating at a pace that reflects her talent.“Hopefully they won’t be opening for people like me for too much longer,” Isbell said. But he’s aware of what the slot can do for musicians who need a boost. “Maybe this is a way that some people will be introduced to their music.” It’s not without precedent: “Chris Stapleton opened one of my Ryman shows back in the day,” Isbell pointed out. Stapleton is now one of country music’s most bankable stars, with more than a dozen Grammy nominations and five wins. “Sturgill Simpson has opened one of these too,” he added, referring to the critically acclaimed country singer with a Best Country Album Grammy to his name. “So it is a platform for a lot of folks.” He frowned and paused. “I'm not saying that's why they got huge, just that, before they got huge, this was something they did.”This kind of pause for self-reflection seems to be second nature to Isbell. Over our conversation, he regularly checked himself to leave less room for ambiguous interpretations. Perhaps this is why he is bothered by imprecision, and he wants to politely put some distance between himself and country music. “I don’t consider myself a country musician,” he told me. “I grew up in the country. I appreciate certain aspects of country music as a songwriter. But I'm in a rock’n’ roll band, and that's how I look at it.” I pointed out that until recently, he was a member of the Country Music Association. “They sent me the membership. I did not request the membership,” Isbell told me. “It was like: Congratulations, you’re in our club. Well, I never asked to be in your fucking club.” Advertisement  Still, he acknowledged the areas of overlap between himself and country music. As he conceded, “I sing about a lot of the same things.” The caveat is that the context is often deeper and more challenging. Take “Speed Trap Town,” from his 2015 album Something More Than Free. “Sometimes I’ll introduce it as ‘here’s my country song about trucks and football,’” Isbell said with a smirk. He’s being cheeky: The first verse may mention trucks and football, but this is merely the backdrop; the song is actually about a state trooper known for pulling women over and sexually assaulting them, now dying in the ICU while his family struggles over whether they should go see him, and the shame that comes with that. It’s not exactly tailgate party material, but it’s the kind of complex songwriting that has earned Isbell his reputation as a formidable storyteller.But is it country music? “When people call me a country musician, I don’t mind it necessarily, depending on the point they’re trying to make,” he told me. “But there never should have been ‘country music’ to begin with.”This may seem tangential, but it’s actually the whole ball game. At the turn of the 20th century, Black and white musicians in the South were recording the same songs with the same instruments. The music was borderless and loose. But about 100 years ago, record executives found that by segregating the musicians and positioning “hillbilly music” for white audiences and “race records” for Black audiences, they could make more money.

This is not ancient history. The consequences of that decision come pouring out of your speakers every time you turn on the radio. It didn’t take long before “hillbilly music,” which got repackaged as “country,” was dubbed “the white man’s blues.” The notion of genre is first and foremost a sales pitch, a byproduct of combining capitalism and racism. Outside the music sales infrastructure, the porous borders between genres have long existed, even if it took until this year for the Grammys to finally rename categories like “Urban.”
 


Still, it’s not a given that Isbell would have come to challenge these beliefs about genre and about music. After all, these rules were set up to benefit him and people who look like him. He could jump on the nostalgia train and make a lot of money: He’s a tall, big man with tattoos and Southern rural credentials. It wouldn’t be hard to position him as a vehicle of empty nostalgia.Yet the idea seems like a nonstarter. I asked Isbell about an old quote of his — in 2016, he told GQ, “I don't believe all music is okay. ... I believe some music is bad for people to listen to. I think it makes their taste worse, I think it makes their lives worse, I think it makes them worse people.” I was intrigued by the concept. He explained that he was referring to “anything that panders, anything that serves to reinforce a story that you already believe.” So that’s about half of country radio. “I think anything that tries to use nostalgia against you, anything that tries to reinforce your fears, that’s bad for you,” he added.Nostalgia is a beast of fiction: It’s an act of selective editing, of carving out just the bits you want, in order to tell the story you want to tell. It’s the kind of forgetting rampant in country music. Seeking nostalgia is seeking a mirage, for its beauty, yes, but also for its safety. Isbell is not in the business of safety. His music paints the image of a man who’d sooner shout a thousand uncomfortable truths than take refuge in one lie.
 


Mickey Guyton was standing beside a row of pews on the floor of the auditorium, waiting for a staff member of the Ryman to take the cover off a display case. Behind it, there’s a dress she wore earlier this year on that very stage, and she wanted to be reunited with it, perhaps as a grounding force.While she waited, she smiled and kept an eye on her band who were onstage for soundcheck, working through “Lay It on Me,” an emotional number with a big soaring chorus. She held her hand to her chest as the band repeated the backing vocal refrain: “I’m right here.” In the empty Ryman, it sounded like a reassuring prayer.It must be a comfort to Guyton to have people who are right here — people who have your back, in a town that mostly hasn’t. By now, she’s become the most visible case of country music’s neglect of Black women.Guyton spent much of the last decade in recording industry purgatory: She never wanted to be anything other than a country singer, but she kept running into walls everywhere she went. She was put in silos by gatekeepers who tried to position her as an R&B artist. Collaborators suggested songs about blue-eyed love interests. The message, loud and clear, was that country music doesn’t quite know what to do with a Black woman. Advertisement  By February 2020, running into walls was losing its charm for Guyton. It had been a decade of being touted as a future star, only for little to happen. “I was just ready to give up by that point,” she told me. “I was just like, This ain’t it. I deserve better than this.” You can roughly see the moment she thought her career was over. It was, out of all places, on the Ryman stage. It came during an industry showcase that same month, where she was debuting a new song, “What Are You Gonna Tell Her?” It’s a moving account of suffocating under sexism and racism and having to explain it to a young child. (“She thinks love is love / And if you work hard, that's enough / Skin's just skin and it doesn't matter,” she sings.) You can see Guyton’s face collapse for a moment as she received a standing ovation from the crowd. Maybe she treated it as a last outing. “I thought, That’s it. This is over,” she told me.Then two days after George Floyd’s murder, amid massive protests across America, Guyton posted to Instagram a snippet of a song she’d written a year prior. The video is just a 38-second screen-recording of a file she has on her phone. Her voice full of emotion, she sings, “If you think we live / In the land of the free / You should try to be / Black like me.” It’s a pointed and forceful reversal of the jingoism that pervades country music.Guyton revealed that she didn’t consult the label or have a particular plan when she posted the snippet. She just hoped it would comfort people who heard it. It did a lot more than that. Within minutes, dozens of commenters were eager for a full-length version. Then Spotify asked for a finished song to place in country playlists. Advertisement  Immediately, “Black Like Me” was acclaimed by critics and fans alike. It’s hard to say which came first: the profound interest in Guyton, or the scurrying to fix the optics of having too many white faces in country music. But either way, she could no longer be ignored by the country establishment. “Black Like Me” earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Country Solo Performance, a first for a Black woman in the category — and she did it without even having an album out.The Mickey Guyton moment was now in full swing. She was invited to cohost the Academy of Country Music Awards with Keith Urban in April 2021, becoming the first Black woman to host the ceremony. The dress Guyton wore at that awards show, a floor-length blue gown, is now inside that prominent display case at the Ryman. It stands next to a guitar that country legend Emmylou Harris once played on the same stage. In other words, Guyton’s dress is now a part of country music history.At the end of soundcheck, Guyton shared a tender moment with Isbell onstage. “Thank you for everything, and thank you for what you’re doing for Black women especially,” she told him. “It’s about walking the walk and not being afraid of walking the walk.” She sounded like someone who has embraced the role of ambassador of Black country artists. Advertisement     
 


That night, when Guyton took the stage to open for Isbell, it was her first concert at the Ryman since she thought it was all over. In a full-circle moment, she opened her set with “What Are You Gonna Tell Her?”, the song she sang just before she thought it was all coming to an end. Before long, the crowd erupted into a standing ovation. By the end of her set, she got another three, or perhaps thirty — I couldn’t keep track, because this audience was rooting for Guyton with every note. At one point, she called out for the Black people in the audience. Hearing a few loud whoops and a “We love you, Mickey,” she pointed at the crowd. “I see you!” she exclaimed.The next morning after the show, when I met up with Guyton at her management’s office in Nashville, she couldn’t quite wrap her mind around the rapturous reception at the Ryman. Advertisement     “I just never know what to expect,” Guyton said. “I’ve gotten some pretty awful responses online.” The racist abuse directed at Guyton on social media has exacted a heavy toll on her, particularly after the video of Wallen saying the n-word emerged. “The hate runs deep,” she tweeted in response to the news. A day later, she expanded: “This is exactly who country music is. I’ve witnessed it for 10 gd years.” And the heartbreaker: “I question on a daily basis as to why I continue to fight to be in an industry that seems to hate me so much.”The sentiment is only a little bit about Wallen, Guyton told me. “I don’t think he’s a horrible person. I think he’s a sick person who said something that he really, really regrets. And he deserves grace for that.” But it was her experiences with Wallen’s fans that left her shaken. “I mean, I was called a ‘fucking nigger,’” Guyton said. “Just pages and pages and pages [of abuse] in my DMs.”So you can understand why Guyton might seem uncertain of whom she was singing in front of. “I’m a little traumatized. So I walk onstage fearful that that’s what I’m about to get.” What she got at the Ryman was thunderous adoration and standing ovations. “This is what I wanted for so long,” Guyton told me. “This was my vision, but it didn’t happen for so long. So I’m still just retraining my brain to be like, Oh, we’re here.” Advertisement     Guyton is indeed here. The same week we were speaking, she was named CMT’s Breakout Artist of the Year. In her acceptance speech, she told an audience of her peers that she “made it [her] life’s purpose to show that country music really is everyone’s music.” Her voice broke as she dedicated the speech to those who have felt left out of country: “I am here for you. I am my sister’s keeper.”
 


I asked Guyton if she’s tired of playing the role of class valedictorian, of the burden of explaining being Black in country instead of just celebrating the songs she’s written. “It does get tiring,” she conceded, “but if I don’t talk about it, who will?” She’s aware that people are listening to her, and she feels the responsibility to use that power. Advertisement     
 


In the era of Charley Pride, country music’s biggest Black superstar, there was a pervading ethos that country music only has room for one Black star. Guyton contended that remnants of this attitude are still lingering. “After Charley and Linda [Martell], there was nothing for 25 years. Then there’s Darius [Rucker], then there’s nothing. Now we have Kane [Brown] and Jimmie [Allen],” Guyton said, “but I'll be damned if I let another 25 years go by and there's not a Black female country superstar.”So she spent the rest of our interview talking up some Black up-and-comers who needed attention. She seemed anxious to make sure anyone interviewing her will leave with a list of names to go investigate. She was bursting to tell me about Madeline Edwards (“I think she's like the Amy Winehouse of country music”). A month after our conversation, when Guyton performed her ode to Black hair, “Love My Hair,” at the Country Music Association Awards, she invited Edwards and Brittney Spencer on stage with her.If Guyton has anything to say about it, there will never again be room for just one. “My theory is that the only way for it to work is if there is not one, not two, not three, but several Black artists busting down that door,” Guyton said. “If we’re lifting each other up, then each of us individually are going to do the same thing for other artists. That’s the only way to keep it going.”
 


In 1991, George H.W. Bush declared October “Country Music Month.” In his proclamation, he stated that “to listen to a country and western song is to hear the story of America set to music.” He told the nation that country music is “honest, good-natured music played with style and spirit. Like a favorite pair of faded blue jeans, it fits the way we live.” Eighteen years before Bush, Nixon made a similar proclamation, saying, “No matter where men and women happen to live, country music may be one of the truest voices speaking to and for them.”That kind of romanticization of country music as America’s song is not limited to presidents from a distant past. Toby Keith performed at Donald Trump’s inauguration celebrations, as did Lee Greenwood, whose song “God Bless the USA” became regular rally entrance music for the former president. The entwinement of country music and nationalism is not even limited to Republicans; Garth Brooks performed at Joe Biden’s inauguration earlier this year.Still, while plenty of country songs touch on the theme of quiet pride in the place you’re from, the overly jingoistic part of the genre lends itself to aligning with conservatism. And those close associations with right-wing politics are not accidental. It’s just a smart political strategy. When Nixon visited the Grand Ole Opry and connected country music with conservative values, these were, as Jacobin writes, “calculated attempts at inventing a ‘white working class’ and pitting it against the radical movements that had emerged in the 1960s.” Country became embroiled in the explicit project of stoking the resentments of white people, particularly rural white people. Advertisement     A week before Isbell’s Ryman residency began, the conservative website the Daily Wire held a live event on that very stage in front of a sold-out audience. Ben Shapiro, the website’s founder, showed up wearing a bolo tie. Just a year prior, Shapiro moved to Nashville and brought the rest of the Daily Wire with him.Shapiro didn’t build his following as a conservative commentator by being a mild-mannered fellow who likes the free market. He got there through torqued rhetoric, saying things like “Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage.” He’s been called out for anti-LGBTQ comments. And he once tweeted on the anniversary of Trayvon Martin’s birthday that the teenager would be alive “if he hadn’t taken a man’s head and beaten it on the pavement before being shot.”All of this makes the Ryman stage hit different this time for Jason Isbell. “If I was the venue, I’d probably not book that,” he said with a grimace. He was clearly wrestling with this. He wouldn’t go as far as suggesting banning Shapiro and company from the stage, he said, because “I don’t want the Ryman telling me I can’t say my fuckin’ liberal, progressive shit from the stage.” He added, “So that is where the First Amendment comes into play.” But still, he can’t help but feel differently about his beloved Ryman. “It changes my opinion of the venue a little bit. I’m not quite as proud to play the place after that happened as I was before.” Advertisement     
 


Isbell and Shapiro don’t know each other, but they’ve had a minor internet spat over gun control once. Isbell tweeted that people who are fighting over the definition of an assault weapon are being deliberately misleading. “You know what an assault weapon is, and you know you don’t need one,” he tweeted. In response, one of his followers gave an earnest rebuttal: “Legit question for rural Americans,” a man named Willie McNabb tweeted. “How do I kill the 30-50 feral hogs that run into my yard within 3-5 mins while my small kids play?” The response was an immediate meme sensation. Advertisement     The attention that Isbell’s original tweet got didn’t seem to sit well with Shapiro, who shot back, “Actually, no, I don’t ‘know what an assault weapon is.’ And neither do you.” Big mistake. Isbell responded that he has “owned and fired those guns. … You pretend to be confused in order to con people who actually are.”That was the end of it. Isbell told me, “I didn't hear much back from Ben after that. I think that was a difficult one for him to logic his way out of, because he just didn't look like the kind of man who has owned those kinds of guns.” But he conceded gleefully, “Maybe he is. I could be wrong.”Too often, living in certain parts of the South, or owning certain guns, is used as shorthand for conservatism. Isbell complicates this story. He stands as an inconvenient challenge to what he calls a “con,” the trick of using nostalgia and white resentment to keep rural white Americans believing that they are victims, that something has been taken away from them. You know the coded rhetoric. It’s the one that says America has to be made great again. It’s the kind of narrative that explicitly tries to use nostalgia against you, in Isbell’s parlance. Advertisement     It’s also a narrative that has many champions. “They got their [Hillbilly Elegy author and Ohio Senate seat candidate] J.D. Vances, people who can cover a large group of people, for example in Appalachia, and convince them to fall for the grift,” Isbell said. He knows it’s a grift because he’s had the opportunity to see the truth.“I didn't realize until I got in my 20s and started touring around the country what poor in America really was,” Isbell said. “We got out into some of the Indigenous territories, and I was shocked that this existed in America because that looked like a country that I had read about and not the one that I had lived in.” It didn’t cohere with the story he had been told about his own poverty. “When I was a little kid, we were all the same. So I didn’t think we were poor. And then I got a little older and I thought, Oh, I grew up poor, and then I got out there and I thought, No, I was just fine.”The reason this message works best coming from him is his credibility. “I grew up in rural Alabama with a lot of people who had a lot of backwards beliefs, people who hunted and fished and got in fights and drank too much and loved football.” It’s not as though he’s been taught about systemic racism from the first grade. “I’m not coming at these opinions because somebody has force-fed them to me from the time when I was a child,” Isbell said. “I figured this shit out on my own, with the help of a lot of good friends that I met once I started touring and traveling.” Advertisement     
 


I asked why he finds himself so opposed to the narrative of white victimhood. “Because there’s no way it’s true. I would be happy to consider it because it would serve me well to be able to say ‘I’m a victim,’” he replied. “I would love that. I don’t have too much pride. I’ll use whatever. But it’s just not true, and it’s so untrue that I couldn’t sell it with a straight face.”Isbell has imbued some of his songs with these themes. Take “White Man’s World” from his 2017 album The Nashville Sound. It’s a song explicitly about coming to terms with the ways he has benefited from being a white man. There’s the line about becoming a father and believing that the world will belong to his daughter, “but her mama knew better.” There’s the line about his complicity in “pretending not to hear another white man’s joke” in front of a Black man. “When people try to attack the statements that I made in that song, they use phrases like ‘shame’ or ‘white guilt,’” Isbell said. “But I think it’s possible to acknowledge that you have benefited from a system that’s unequal without feeling shame or even guilt from it.”In fact, Isbell wants to go further than just acknowledging. “I think it’s possible to change your ways without feeling guilty or ashamed,” he said. “I think that’s what I was looking for with that song: to try to remind people that their story is not the only one.”
 


When I walked into Brittney Spencer’s greenroom above the Ryman stage, she was asking if anyone in the room had any lotion or shea butter. The only Black member of her band, drummer Desmond Davis, did. She got the lotion, and then we were off to find somewhere quiet to talk. On the way, she was bouncing off the walls, descending the stairs three steps at a time, and swinging from the railing.“Today is a good day,” she said, beaming. “I’m opening up for Jason Isbell, one of the best people I’ve ever met in my life.” Spencer and Isbell have an easy rapport. At soundcheck, he suggested a collaboration on the last encore of the night: “Gimme Shelter” by the Rolling Stones. “You up for it?” he asked. “Hell yeah, that’s my shit,” she responded. Most people would not just be up for the task on a whim.But then again, Spencer is not most people. She may have had her breakout moment only a year ago, but she’s been honing her craft for some time. “People get shocked when I tell them I’ve been here for so long,” Spencer told me. “But I’ve just been writing songs in my bedroom for eight years.” So she’s been putting in the time to develop a powerful voice she knows how to deploy. Advertisement     It’s that voice that caught the attention of Amanda Shires, Isbell’s wife, in October 2020. Spencer tweeted a video of herself alone with her acoustic guitar, singing “Crowded Table,” a cover of the signature song of Shires’ supergroup, the Highwomen. Shires reposted it with a simple message: “This is beautiful, Highwoman. Some day we will play again—and when we do, we’d be honored if you’d come sing this with us.”From there, things took off for Spencer. Soon, she was writing songs with Shires and Isbell and others. Her profile grew. By July 2021, she quit her job at Warby Parker, the glasses retailer. Last month, the 33-year-old announced her own headlining tour. Nashville’s MusicRow magazine just named her a 2022 Next Big Thing. But how does it feel when your stardom begins with people like Isbell and Shires championing you? “It feels like you’re surrounded and protected. It feels like you’re not alone,” she said. Spencer understands that her kind of story doesn’t come along often. She explained that she met with Guyton long before her video went viral, and she’d seen how Guyton was willing to fight for the next generation. Spencer recalled, “Mickey said to me, ‘I don’t think success is going to happen for me. I don’t see a future for me, but there could be a future for the younger generation, for other people that are coming up behind me.’”
 


Things are happening fast for Spencer. It’s hard to believe that she is still green, that she doesn’t yet have an album out. She’s so green, in fact, that she has never seen her name on a drumhead. Until tonight, when Desmond, her drummer, surprised her with one for the big Ryman show. Spencer squealed with excitement at the sight. When Shires passed by, Spencer yelled after her: “You know I’m only here because of you, right?” Shires was having none of it. “No, baby, you’re here because of you.”Amythyst Kiah can’t wrap her mind around the journey she’s taken either. “When I was a teenager, I was one of two Black people I knew who played guitar,” she said. “And I was the only girl I knew who played guitar.” And now? “Now I’m the face that I needed to see when I was younger,” she said. “Now people younger than me are looking to me and seeing that, yes, this is possible. You can express yourself in this way.”The 35-year-old covers a range of roots genres, marrying country blues with elements of folk and rock. She writes powerful, defiant songs about growing up Black and gay in the South. Advertisement     Speaking by phone a couple of days after she opened for Isbell, Kiah extolled the virtues of therapy. “It was a huge day to play the Ryman and have a chance to talk with Jason after the show — about songwriting but also therapy — and come away from this amazing experience to realize I need to not be so hard on myself,” she said.What role has therapy played in her life? Kiah explained that even though she writes songs about what she needs to process, “that wasn’t enough, because I didn’t have the vocabulary or the perspective to actively engage with what was going on with me.”Having a therapist has been helpful as she navigates the questions of performing in a genre whose stars don't often look like her. “Within the space, we’ve had to mentally deal with a lot,” she said. “We’ve had to deal with rejection, we’ve had to deal with ‘Am I good enough?’, but we’ve also had to deal with ‘Do I feel safe doing this?’”In addition to her solo work, Kiah is a part of Our Native Daughters, an Americana supergroup that also features Rhiannon Giddens, Leyla McCalla, and Allison Russell. The four Black women, all wielding banjos, released Songs of Our Native Daughters in 2019, an album that explores the forces that have shaped the lives of Black women, from misogyny to slavery. Advertisement     The album’s opener, “Black Myself,” is written by Kiah. It’s a song that starts defiant in the face of racism before turning into an ode to being rooted in your community. In 2020, she earned a Grammy nomination for Best American Roots Song for the song. She rerecorded it for her most recent album.Kiah has been blown away by the messages she gets. “I get messages from Black women saying, ‘Hey, I started learning the banjo and getting into folk music because I saw Our Native Daughters,’” she said. “White people message me and say, ‘your work really helped change my perspective on how I saw the history of this country.’”
 


The bars of Broadway seem to be bursting with a desire to return Wallen to his perch. Within a two-block radius, I heard five different Wallen covers. Three of them were of “Whiskey Glasses,” his breakout hit. Each time, hundreds of people inside the bar were screaming every line of the lyrics. Clearly, it’s a crowd-pleaser. Advertisement     In general, the numbers Wallen puts up suggest he is one of the most popular country stars of his generation. Even in a year where he was briefly taken off the radio, he still managed to get five songs in the top 50 of Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart. Wallen alone constitutes 10% of the top 50.Even the moratorium on being played on the radio had a positive effect on Wallen’s album sales. After all promotion for his record ceased in the wake of the racial slur scandal, Dangerous: The Double Album went on an impressive streak at the top of the charts. Wallen will end the year as the top-selling artist in America across all genres, one spot ahead of Olivia Rodrigo, and four spots above Drake.Remember “Cover Me Up,” Isbell’s signature song? According to Spotify, it’s far and away his most popular song, streamed more than 48 million times. But there is another version of it with more spins on the streamer: Morgan Wallen’s cover, which is on Dangerous, has racked up 190 million listens. It’s fucking preposterous.I asked Isbell to take me back to the call when Wallen asked to cover “Cover Me Up.” Isbell clarified dryly, “Oh, that’s not the call. The call is ‘Wallen has covered ‘Cover Me Up.’” Other artists do not need your permission to cover your song, they simply need to pay you. Still, even if Isbell’s permission wasn’t required, Wallen initially had his blessing anyway. Isbell thought the cover might introduce “Cover Me Up” to a new audience. Advertisement     
 


Did the success of Wallen’s version change his relationship to the song? “No, that’s my song,” Isbell said assuredly. “It is my baby that I have had to carry through a rainstorm.” Besides, the context is so very specific to Isbell and his sobriety. “I wrote it for myself and for my wife years ago,” he said. “I’m disappointed in the type of person that he became — or maybe was, and didn’t reveal until it was too late — but that has nothing to do with that song.”After news of Wallen’s racial slur, Isbell announced that he’d be donating his royalties from the song to the Nashville chapter of the NAACP. “The mistakes that he made,” Isbell told me, “were enough to warrant giving somebody else that spot.” By “that spot,” he means the full lobbying support of the country industry: radio, TV, magazine covers, a push for a musical guest spot on Saturday Night Live, you name it. It’s the machinery that made Wallen the top-selling artist of the year. “The problem was they had already invested so much money in Morgan that when he made those mistakes, they didn’t want to lose that investment.” Advertisement     But is it so simple to give the support to somebody else? “I know a lot of people think it’s not that easy,” Isbell said, “but it is. It’s manufactured. Promotional budgets determine who is going to be the darling of the industry at any given time.” The frustration is in seeing all the people who could be given that opportunity. “That spot was available for someone like Mickey. Why not? That would be a great story,” Isbell said.
 


Is this tantamount to “canceling” Wallen? “I hear a lot of people say, ‘How dare you do this to this young man in the prime of his life?’” Isbell said impatiently. “This man is going to be fine. There’s a lot of people who are fucking doing awesome who are not singing country songs on Saturday Night Live.”But fine. Let us grant that there might be a path for Wallen to redeem himself. What could that look like? Perhaps he might “go through some steps and try to craft some kind of way where he can show us that he has learned from this experience,” Isbell said. “But not even that happened.”Instead, what has happened is…nothing. Wallen pledged $500,000 to Black-led organizations. As of this fall, he has yet to donate much of his pledge. In many ways, it seems the appearance of redemption is more important than actually doing the work of proving you’ve changed. “Listen to how they talk about George Jones,” Isbell said of the country legend. “There’s a lot of shit that George did that was not cool, shit that you really should not be able to be completely redeemed from.” Jones has a well-documented history of violence, misogyny, and, racism. “But everything ended well, according to the country music's narrative.”Isbell paused. “I don’t mean to pick on George Jones. I think he’s the greatest country singer that ever lived,” he clarified. “But he did a lot of really, really terrible, terrible shit.” This is the magic trick: to be able to hold both truths in hand at the same time, instead of rushing to the redemption.“Excuses have been made over and over to try to craft that same white male narrative. It’s just part of the story. It’s like, ‘Yes, sometimes, as white men who’ve been put upon, we slip and we make mistakes, but we can rise again! And that’s country music, folks,’” Isbell said. “For people who already believe it’s true in their life, it gets reinforced when they hear it on the radio. And they don’t have to question it, they can just enjoy the nostalgia of it.”I asked Isbell: What do those audiences get out of this nostalgia? What makes it so appealing? “They want to hear how heroes are just like us. But I think we can ask for a little more,” he said. “Let’s look for real heroes. People who devote their whole life to a battle they know they’re not going to win. Those are the real fucking heroes.”
 


In between songs on the third night of Isbell’s residency, I struck up a conversation with an audience member I’d seen the day before. Sarah Shea told me she and her husband, Matthew, come every year from Alabama for Isbell’s Ryman residency. This year, they’re attending three nights. Last time, they went to four. She’s excited that their children will soon be old enough to join for a few shows too, maybe starting next year.I asked Sarah what she thought of the openers so far. She had rave reviews of both Guyton and Spencer. “They blew me away. I’m just so mad I’ve never heard their music before,” she told me. “I can’t believe I haven’t even heard their names.”I started to ask her another question when Isbell launched into “Stockholm,” a favorite of hers, and she disappeared back into the music she came here for. But after the show, Sarah was excited to share the new artists she just discovered. About Spencer, she tweeted, “buy all her merch, attend all her shows, and add her to every playlist.” And like that, a new fan was born. ● Advertisement

“We did not have a serious ongoing relationship. We saw each other sporadically between December 2020 and March 13, 2021,” he wrote. “[Nichols] told me that she had been involved with other athletes and understood the limitations of our relationship; to wit, that we might see each other on a sporadic basis for consensual sex only.”
 


“We did not have any dates in the traditional sense at any time; there were no dining at restaurants, going to movies, traveling or any other indicia of a normalized relationship,” he said. “There was only Snapchats of ‘where’ and ‘what time’ we would hook up and what hotels would be used.“We never had any telephone calls, emails, nor did we exchange text messages. We only communicated via the Snapchat application. My username on Snapchat has always been ‘blkjesus00.'”
 


“I was never notified that [Nichols] saved a message from me,” he claimed. “[Nichols] has attached to her paper many Snapchat messages which she claims are ‘real’ and represent ‘real’ communications between us.“However, I strongly contend that these messages have been fabricated by [Nichols],” Thompson went on. “It is not difficult for an individual to manufacture such messages by using two other cell phones, one that has been designated ‘TT’ which was not my username and the second phone which is hers.”

320,Ben Affleck has responded to backlash over comments he made about his relationship with alcohol throughout his marriage to Jennifer Garner.,"Ben Affleck has responded to intense backlash over comments he made about his relationship with alcohol throughout his marriage to Jennifer Garner. Ben — who is now dating Jennifer Lopez — was married to Jennifer Garner for 10 years before the couple announced their split in 2015. Their divorce was later finalized in 2018, and since then, Ben and Jen appear to have maintained a solid and civil co-parenting foundation to the benefit of their three shared children — Violet, 16, Seraphina, 12, and Samuel, 9. As you may know, Ben has been vocal about his difficult relationship with alcohol, and sadly, how his marriage was affected by his addiction struggles. After first going to rehab in 2001, Ben sought further treatment for alcohol addiction on several occasions during his marriage to Garner in 2008, 2017, and again in 2018 after their divorce was finalized. In the past, the Oscar winner has spoken candidly about how his addiction was the catalyst for their split, explaining in 2020 that he started drinking “more and more” as their marriage was “falling apart,” which led to “more marital problems.” However, Ben has praised Jennifer for her love and care throughout his recovery — both during their marriage and after they separated. In a 2017 statement, he wrote that he was thankful for his “co-parent, Jen,” who supported their family as he did the work he “set out to do.” So, in light of their seemingly positive co-parenting relationship, many were left shocked on Monday after Ben appeared to suggest that difficulties in his marriage had been the cause of his drinking problems. Promoting his new movie, The Tender Bar, during an interview with Howard Stern, Ben spoke incredibly candidly about the breakdown of his marriage. “The truth was we took our time, we made the decision, we grew apart,” he began. “We had a marriage that didn't work.” “We tried because we had kids,” he continued. “We did not want it to be the model of marriage for the kids. We did our best. I knew she was a good mom, and I hoped she knew I was a good dad.” Going on to talk about how his alcohol addiction affected their relationship, Ben told Howard Stern that if they were still married he’d “probably still be drinking,” explaining that feeling “trapped” in their marriage was “part of why” he relapsed into unhealthy drinking habits. “I was like ‘I can't leave because of my kids, but I'm not happy. What do I do?’ What I did was drink a bottle of scotch and fall asleep on the couch, which turned out not to be the solution,” he added. His comments instantly sparked a huge wave of criticism, particularly in light of the fact that Jennifer — as stated by Ben himself — was of great support to him throughout his recovery. And having seen the backlash, Ben swiftly hit back at reports that he was ""blaming"" her for his alcohol addiction. During an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live last night, the actor insisted that his comments had been taken out of context and maintained that he would never “say a bad word” about his ex-wife. Ben began by elaborating on the context of his interview with Howard Stern, clarifying that his comments about Jen had been lifted from a much wider and more nuanced conversation. “I had the chance to do an interview with a friend of yours, Howard Stern,” he told Jimmy. “It was this really cool, long-form, in-depth, you know. It was a two-hour interview.” “And because the movie is about family and all this stuff that’s meaningful to me, we talked a lot about my family, and you know, divorce and alcoholism and struggling with real things,” he said, admitting that he had initially been really pleased with how the interview went. “Honestly, I was really happy with it,” Ben revealed. “At the end of the interview I thought: ‘Wow, I should do more honest, exploratory, self-evaluating things.’” The actor went on to claim that it wasn’t until he was made aware of the backlash on Twitter that he realized that his words had been misinterpreted. “I started seeing all this stuff come up on Twitter … and I sort of researched through it and saw that one of these websites had done the clickbait thing,” he explained. “I looked on [the article], and they had literally taken the conversation that I had had for two hours and made it seem as if I was saying the exact opposite of what I had said,” Ben said. The Argo director went on to say that the wider discussion had been about the practicality of his and Jennifer Garner’s successful co-parenting relationship in the wake of their split. “I had gone on and said how much we respect each other and cared about each other, and cared about our kids and put them first and went through our stuff,” he said, adding that the seemingly misinterpreted quotes made him appear like an “awful guy.” “They said that I have blamed my ex-wife for my alcoholism and that I was ‘trapped’ in this marriage,” Ben told Jimmy. “[They] just made me out to be the worst, most insensitive, stupid, awful guy.” Talking about his public image, Ben used the example of his viral memes to illustrate that while he doesn’t mind being the subject of public scrutiny, he has a duty to protect his family. “Look, I know people do this, I get it — I’m happy to be Sad Batman, I’m happy to be Dunkin' Donuts and the meme, I understand,” he said. ""But really, if it’s about my kids I’ve gotta just draw a line."" The father of three went on to clarify once and for all that he would never want to speak badly of Jennifer. “It’s the exact opposite of who I am, what I believe,” he said of the accusations. “I would never want my kids to think I would ever say a bad word about their mom. Because I never had, I never would.” Visibly upset, he concluded: “Being the subject of [media scrutiny] is just sort of the cost of doing business as an actor, but, like, not with my kids. Don’t do that. It’s wrong. It hurts me, it hurts them. Stop that.”"

2021 was our second year of working from home and the year we really ramped up our home cooking efforts. How’d we do it? Ordering frozen soup dumplings by mail, fancy pizza ovens and grills, and an unassuming, but incredibly effective herb preserver.These items were independently selected by staff and except where noted, they spent their own money on it. Just so you know, BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them.

Traeger Ironwood pellet grill — $1,400–$1,600 at TragerThe Traeger Ironwood pellet grill is hands down the best thing I have tried this year largely because it is responsible for so many exquisitely smoky meals but also because I am a huge barbecue dork and this may well be the holy grail (Traeger loaned BuzzFeed a grill to review). I have yet to cook a bad meal on this thing, and I have cooked more than a few of those in the past on our former grill (RIP) — despite, say, setting multiple overnight alarms to check the grill temp on a 32-hour brisket. It’s hard to explain the catastrophic despondency and frustration of discovering that a brisket you have obsessively babied with techniques painstakingly sourced from 50 different BBQ subreddits looks and tastes like the bottom of an old flip flop. But the Traeger pellet grill has, for me, made that a thing of the past. Instead of charcoal, it burns pellets methodically fed to it by a temperature-controlled auger that capably holds a slow-and-low smoke for as long as you need it to (and has a special “super smoke” feature). And it has nailed everything I’ve cooked on it — chicken, ribs, brisket, pork shoulder, sausage — in a way that’s often inspired “this is your best INSERT FOOD HERE yet” accolades from family and friends. Honestly, I wish I’d saved up (it is not cheap), gritted my teeth, and bought this a few years ago. —John Paczkowski
 


Shipment of frozen soup dumplings from Xiao Chi Jie — $39.95 at Xiao Chi JieThis Seattle-based restaurant will mail you a packet of 50 frozen soup dumplings (xiao long bao) that you keep in your freezer and then cook drunkenly when you come home late but want to reward yourself with the most delicious food known to man.For the uninitiated, soup dumplings are humanity’s greatest achievement. You bite the top off, sip out the delicious filling, then consume them with the sauce of your choice. Incredible.These ones are filled with either pork, shrimp and pork, or chicken. Of course, they also sell the accompanying sauces. There’s the classic vinegar, as well a chilli crisp oil that deserves to be studied and a ginger and scallion umami source which I want to bathe in. They also sell bamboo steamers if you need one.They even offer a VIP Dumpling Program where they’ll mail you packets every month if you want, which is a truly spectacular idea for which they deserve to make a fortune. —David Mack Advertisement  
 


Tomato pieI had never heard of tomato pie until this summer. If you had asked me if tomato pie was a thing, I suppose I would have said yes? I don’t know. Life before tomato pie is all a blur. Here’s what I remember: going to a farmers market on the way home from a weekend at a rental upstate, being overwhelmed by the produce selection, and almost doing what I always do when overwhelmed by farmers market produce, which is buy some token non-produce item (a baked good, honey, soap) and leave, but then my husband said, “What if we buy a bunch of heirloom tomatoes and make a tomato pie?” It was such a sure-footed plan, offered up as though we had ever made a tomato pie before, that there could be no response but to buy those tomatoes and make that pie. I would provide a recipe, but I actually just googled around and cobbled together a few. The gist is this: You cut up the tomatoes and drain them a bit, you layer them in a pie crust with basil, and then you top it off with a mozzarella/mayonnaise mixture that doesn’t taste mayonnaisey once you’re done. Then you bake it. It’s basically like a fresher, tomato-first take on pizza, and it’s the best possible solution to late-summer farmers market decision fatigue. —Sam Henig
 


The Ooni Koda 12-inch pizza oven — $319 at Williams Sonoma, BloomingdalesI lusted after this pizza oven for several years before I finally bought it, and when I did buy it, it was as a Christmas gift for my dad. But playing with his forced me to pony up for one of my own. It was just too good.Here’s why:It gets really hot — 950 degrees hot. There are things for which a regular household oven is simply not hot enough, and they are where the Ooni shines.It does more than pizza! Throw in a cast-iron skillet with broccoli, or asparagus, or brassica steaks, or actual steaks, and you’ll have a fantastic meal ready in just a few minutes. Seriously: There are so many applications here. Kebabs! Naan! Branzino!The pizzas are fantastic. Truly better than any I’ve had at a restaurant. Your edges will get a bit singed, and that is not bad. I prefer a quick prebake of the crust (with continuous rotation for an even bake) before adding sauces and toppings. For an unconventional but delicious white pie, roast a big head of garlic, mash it, and whisk it into a bechamel with some fresh sage. Sub this for the tomato sauce and top with your choice of veggies. —Emily Baker-White
 


Ayako & Family Hanabi plum jam — $16 at Ayako & FamilyI choose to believe that jam can be classified as tech because my body is a machine and food makes it work. This summer, I was expecting to make up about 50% of my food intake with fruit. But for whatever reason, I couldn’t get the fix I needed; almost all the stone fruit I ate was grainy and tasteless, not at all the sunshiny flavor I craved. So I decided to make up for it with fancy jam in the fall and winter. When I say fancy, I mean that this stuff is $16 a jar. But Alessandra Gordon, a second-generation jam-maker, makes the headiest preserves from plum varieties I’ve never heard of. This jam is not at all too sweet; one spoon of the rich, dark Hanabi Plum jam on yogurt tastes like something I’d pay $15 for at a really, really nice brunch place. It’s basically saving money. Plus, once you consider that the company’s base wage is $18 per hour and the staff is all people of color and/or queer, the price feels more than right. —Estelle Tang
 


Anova steam oven — $599 at AnovaMy wife tersely refers to the Anova Precision Oven as “another of your unnecessary kitchen gadgets.” And yet, she has eaten, with great gusto, the cooked-to-perfection focaccia I’ve made in it. She has also eaten the baguettes I made in it during a baguette marathon that had me baking bread every two days for over a month. And that pork shoulder slow-cooked for 12 hours in a sous vide steam bath? She ate that too. Same thing with a *shockingly* good pizza. So sure, it’s unnecessary, and yes, it is perhaps reckless to spend $599 on an oven that cooks with steam when you already have a real oven. But steam makes for better bread crusts, and cooking sous vide gets foods at the perfect temperature pretty much without fail. And this thing kind of does it all — air-frying and baking, included — and it does it well, and you can run it from an app on your phone. If my kitchen and bank account were both larger, I’d probably buy one. (Anova loaned BuzzFeed an oven to review.) —John Paczkowski
 


Honey-Can-Do herb preserver — $12.69 at AmazonAfter years of watching cilantro and basil rot in the fridge, I finally broke down and bought an herb preserver. My husband and children were highly skeptical, but the cilantro was fresh and green a full TWO WEEKS later. I enjoyed fresh cilantro on three separate dinners (if you’re wondering: guacamole, butter chicken, Vietnamese tofu, and pork). It fits perfectly in the door of the fridge, and at only $13, it’ll pay for itself in a couple of months easily. —Dao Nguyen
 


The Original Baking Steel — $119 at Baking SteelLook, I am fully aware of how ridiculous it must seem to be endorsing a $119 kitchen gadget that is essentially a piece of steel plating pulled off an aircraft carrier, but this thing has proven to be an incredible ally when it comes to baking bread, pizza — anything with a crust, really. The Original Baking Steel is just that — 16 pounds of it. And because steel retains and conducts heat more efficiently than other materials, it can pizzeria the hell out of your kitchen. The Baking Steel’s creators claim it can function as the “equivalent of a 900° wood-fired oven despite being in your 500° home oven.” I have no idea whatsoever if this is true. What I can say is that the bread and pizza I have cooked on it definitely looked and tasted like it, which is all that matters, really. —John PaczkowskiOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

Despite Kim’s brief annoyance, she and North swiftly resumed posting on their joint TikTok account to their 2.3 million followers, with several new videos having been shared since.
 


One person commented, on a reposted clip of the livestream, that “showing their house is dangerous,” and that North “needs to be [off] social media for [a] while.”“Kim needs to take away that phone for a while as punishment. She knows she’s not allowed to go Live and especially show around their house but she did it anyway,” read another comment.“Kim should ban north from tiktok for a while or like just monitor it very closely,” echoed another.
 


“I did the exact same thing as she did,” he went on to write. “I would do the lives and now I regret saying one of the things that I said.”
 


Perhaps most memorably, Mason directly shut down a rumor that had long been circulating around Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott’s relationship — something that would have typically been a plotline uncovered on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. Advertisement

324,"The Louisiana prison has been described by government investigators as having “a culture and conditions that can lead to abuse, mistreatment, and discrimination.”","


The Biden administration is detaining immigrants at a prison in rural Louisiana that’s been described by government investigators as having “a culture and conditions that can lead to abuse, mistreatment, and discrimination,” a BuzzFeed News investigation has found.The Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) delivered the warning to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials in November in a report documenting the presence of mold and pests, problems with medical care, and other issues, including insufficient staff training, at Winn Correctional Center in Winnfield, Louisiana. The prison, which gained notoriety after a Mother Jones reporter worked there as a prison guard and wrote about it in 2016, holds hundreds of people detained for ICE. Advertisement     While immigrant advocates have long complained about poor conditions within the immigrant detention system, documents issued internally by CRCL to ICE officials and obtained by BuzzFeed News provide a glimpse into a government investigation of a prominent detention center that can hold more than 1,000 immigrants at a time and is operated by a private company.The report, dated Nov. 17, recommended that ICE stop placing immigrants there until the conditions improved. The office sent another memo in August with similar advice.“No new detainees should be added to the facility; and the detainee population should be drawn down to zero until immediate health and safety concerns can be corrected,” a CRCL memo dated Aug. 10 stated after experts contracted by the office conducted a review. The advice came from four experts in detention and medical care who reviewed the facility for DHS and said they had major concerns about detainee safety.“At a minimum,” the office wrote in the August plan outlining concerns for detainees, “the population must be halved immediately to address the major plumbing deficiencies.”BuzzFeed News reviewed the August plan and parts of a subsequent CRCL report from November. Taken together, the documents symbolize how problems reported internally within the detention system persist during an administration that promised to fundamentally change immigrant detention. The documents from August and November illustrate a cascade of issues that the investigators discovered, including:CRCL officials had “serious concerns expressed about the health and safety of detainees at Winn.” The officials wrote in November that “overall, Winn has a culture and conditions that can lead to abuse, mistreatment, and discrimination against detainees.” They believed ICE should stop placing detainees at the Winn ICE center “until the identified culture and conditions … are corrected,” including its use of force and lack of training. The November report maintained that staff at the facility should receive new or “enhanced” training on issues like use of force or pandemic safety requirements.Both detainees and employees at Winn reported the presence of cockroaches, spiders, and other pests, along with mold in the facility, according to the November memo. CRCL officials had written in August that Winn did not have enough toilets, showers, and washbasins for the number of detainees at the prison to comply with ICE standards.Immigrants who were put on “suicide watch” were routinely kept in “segregation units” or in solitary confinement. Detainees on suicide watch told the investigators, according to the November report, that the cells were not clean; one immigrant said he was not provided with a mattress. The experts discovered that there was “not always a clear clinical rationale documented” for continuing the suicide watch. In August, investigators said the mental healthcare program at Winn was inadequate.An immigrant who died in 2020 after being held at Winn did not have his “abnormal vital signs” during the intake process and did not receive “adequate medical assessments,” including when he got COVID-19 symptoms, according to medical records reviewed by the experts. “There was also a long delay in sending him to the hospital and there were no records showing that he received continuous monitoring and treatment while waiting for transport,” the experts found in the November report. The same memo stated that detainees did not always receive prescribed medications, that their treatment of pain for those with dental problems was lacking, and that records and nursing assessments were incomplete. In August, investigators said the facility’s medical care was inadequate.At one point, despite a finding that a sexual encounter between two male detainees was consensual, the facility “assessed one of the men as a potential predator with no legitimate justification.” In August, investigators had recommended LGBTQ detainees be prioritized for transfer or release from Winn. “Certain staff remarks, as well as a recent sexual misconduct incident between two male detainees, also indicated a lack of understanding and/or potential bias toward LGBTQ detainees,” the August report stated.The unusual decision by the investigators to send ICE a “proposed action plan” in August included a way to draw down the number of immigrants at the Winn facility by releasing those with medical and mental health issues until the concerns were addressed.The August memo, however, did not appear to lead to any type of significant cut in the number of immigrants detained there.Government data reviewed by BuzzFeed News shows that despite the stark recommendation late in the summer, the average monthly population, compared to that of August, rose in October and November. On average, the vast majority of the more than 900 immigrants detained at the facility in October and November did not have a criminal record.Top Biden officials have not been shy about the apparent standards and goals for immigrants being held by the government.In early September, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said, “No longer will the United States government accept substandard treatment of individuals in immigration detention and fail to respect the dignity that they — like any human being — have.”LaSalle Corrections, the private company that operates the facility, did not respond to a request for comment.ICE officials said the agency was engaging with CRCL on the findings and working to address the areas of concern. Officials noted that an ICE oversight body had inspected Winn this year and found in compliance with agency standards in August.“U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) does not tolerate the mistreatment of those it detains or substandard detention conditions,” an agency spokesperson wrote in a statement sent to BuzzFeed News. “ICE is committed to continually enhancing civil detention operations to ensure people detained by ICE are treated humanely, protected from harm, provided appropriate medical and mental health care, and receive the rights and protections to which they are entitled.”Winn Correctional Center began holding immigrants during the Trump administration as part of its expansion of immigrant detention in Louisiana. The prison’s proximity to the southern border, capacity, and affordable rates made it an easy option for an administration that was intent on detaining immigrants.Jean, a Haitian who was detained at Winn from May to July, told BuzzFeed News that he had severe stomach pain and diarrhea over the summer. Despite his pleas for medical assistance at Winn, he said, he was not able to see a nurse or doctor.“Inside detention, we are not considered as human,” Jean, who spoke under a pseudonym, said through an interpreter.The 27-year-old crossed the border in Arizona in April and sought asylum protections when he was arrested by border agents. Later, in May, he was transferred to Winn. It was there, he said, where he struggled with the fact that he was in a prison. Jean said the guards would ignore detainees who sought help for others who were feeling unwell.“I had never been in such a situation before. I was just looking for safety and security, and they were treating me as a criminal and subhuman,” he said.The Biden campaign has signaled it would seek to scale down the use of private prisons to hold immigrants, especially asylum-seekers. Earlier this year, Politico reported that President Joe Biden was considering an executive order to ban ICE from using private prisons to house immigrants, but no such order has since come. The administration has, however, closed one private facility.“President Biden began his administration with lofty promises about ending the use of private detention centers. But little has changed,” said Eunice Cho, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU. “The Biden administration’s use of private immigration detention is just as bad as under President Trump.”The factors weighing against a scaledown of private facilities are numerous: Contracts are difficult to cut, and facilities that aren’t privately owned are hard to locate as more cities and counties cut off ties with ICE. Like Jean, many detainees in custody are picked up from the border and brought to detention centers across the country.The agency continues to use private facilities because they have the space to hold more immigrants transferred from the border should the government want it.The government uses facilities near the border that charge lower rates and can hold more than 1,000 detainees at a time, like Winn. DHS uses “guaranteed minimum” contracts — in which ICE pays for a certain number of beds regardless of whether they are filled — at facilities like Winn to ensure it will always have access to more space. In May 2020, ICE paid more than $20 million for 12,000 unused beds, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office.Winn Correctional Center, located in a Louisiana forest, drew notoriety when Mother Jones reporter Shane Bauer infamously worked there as a prison guard for four months in 2016 and wrote about it, describing the cells as “tombs.” Back then, the prison was operated by a different private company and held inmates for the state of Louisiana before it began detaining immigrants for ICE.Almost immediately, the facility began to draw complaints.In one particularly striking allegation, Manuel Amaya Portillo, an asylum-seeker with disabilities, alleged staffers never responded to his repeated requests for a wheelchair, according to the ACLU. He told the group that medical staffers “locked him in the medical unit and gave him sedatives, which he had not requested and did not want, during what he later learned was a facility inspection tour by government-contracted outside inspectors who took photos and interviewed detained people.” In recent months, groups like the ACLU have called for the Winn center to be shut down.This year, the Southern Poverty Law Center wrote in a letter to agency officials that one detainee “had to remove his own cyst from his stomach to prevent infection because the facility refused to treat it.” One detainee also told the organization that they had found a live cockroach in their food.In the initial August report, CRCL officials recommended the prison fix 32 of the 64 “smoke barrier doors,” which limit the spread of smoke, that were not working in the detention center’s housing units.“This has been identified as a significant life safety risk and people should not be detained at Winn until all housing unit smoke barrier doors are fully functional,” the report stated, noting that ICE officials had informed them the problem would be taken care of.The investigators also said that the facility needed to make sure that all staffers who had firearms were trained and certified.“CRCL and experts found that at least one staff member had been issued a weapon without firearms certification,” the memo stated.Elsewhere, the investigators found that “Winn only has enough washbasins, showers, and toilets [under ICE detention standards] to house 50% of the current detainee population.”To cut the population at the facility, the investigators recommended prioritizing releases or transfers of people with mental health issues because the mental health program was “inadequate,” according to the expert who reviewed it. Those with medical conditions were also recommended as a priority for release or transfer; CRCL’s medical expert found that the medical care was also inadequate.“There is a delay in providing health care, a major medical staffing shortage, and several COVID-19 positive detainees,” the report stated.Ultimately, the office said that no detainees should be added until the “deficiencies” it found were remedied.In a later report, issued internally in November, CRCL described how the state fire marshal had found in June that none of the smoke doors in the prison dorms worked when the fire alarm was activated. Winn officials said they were considering installing new plexiglass doors.The report also documented how both detainees and staffers had reported mold at the facility, as well as cockroaches, ants, and spiders.When it came to medical care, investigators said that both chronic and acute medical issues were not seen or assessed in a timely manner. Forms filled out by detainees seeking medical help were not regularly picked up by nurses, triaged, or assigned a severity level, according to the report. During the intake screening, detainees’ abnormal vital signs were not acknowledged or treated.“This places detainees at high risk of not receiving critical care in a timely manner,” the report added.Longtime critics of the facility, like Mich Gonzalez, associate director of the SPLC’s immigrant detention project, said they had seen its effects on detainees.“They are desperate,” he said. “Every time I talk to someone, their mental health deteriorates. By the time I get them out, they are half the person they used to be.”

325,Opinion: Overdose prevention centers in New York City can be a model for other cities to follow.,"


Two weeks ago, New York City became the first city in the nation to open two overdose prevention centers, located in Manhattan. Already, 25 overdoses have been averted — 25 people who are alive today thanks to these centers. Now we are calling on the Biden administration to formally authorize overdose prevention centers in the US.Overdose prevention centers are supervised, hygienic spaces for people who use drugs to do so safely, while also providing harm reduction, physical health, and behavioral health services.Every neighborhood in every community has experienced the tragedy of the overdose epidemic. Nationally, over 100,000 Americans died of an overdose between April 2020 to April 2021. In New York City, 2,062 people died of an overdose in 2020, the highest number of deaths since reporting began 20 years ago. The spread of fentanyl — a dangerous, synthetic opioid 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine and the primary driver of the rise in overdoses — exponentially increases the need for even more overdose prevention innovation. Advertisement     Thirty years of research conducted across 100 sites on three continents has demonstrated the efficacy of overdose prevention centers. There has never been a single overdose death at any site. Participants are provided with basic human needs day after day: a smile, a sandwich, or a shower. Over time, trust is built between participants and clinical staff, which leads to participants beginning substance use disorder treatment and referrals to healthcare and other social services.In addition, research shows overdose prevention centers reduce public drug use, syringe litter, and drug-related crime in surrounding neighborhoods. They can also function as safe havens for women who use drugs, reducing violence against women associated with street-based substance use.We believe the overdose prevention centers in New York City will be a model for other cities to follow.Biden recently embraced harm reduction, becoming the first president to include it in his drug policy priorities.In another first, Congress appropriated $30 million in the American Rescue Plan to be provided to state, local, and tribal governments and organizations for overdose prevention and harm reduction services.State governments are also supporting the approach, with Rhode Island legalizing a two-year pilot of overdose prevention centers and other states introducing bills supporting the operation.This is not enough. Significant legal obstacles to widespread operation of overdose prevention centers remain, and the Biden administration has the power to remove them.Currently, a federal law, the Controlled Substances Act, states that it is illegal to operate, own, or rent a location for the purpose of using illegal substances. In April, New York joined San Francisco, Oakland, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Somerville, Massachusetts, in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland requesting he deprioritize enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act against overdose prevention centers. But so far, no action has been taken.The Department of Justice can also issue a memorandum to federal law enforcement to not prosecute the operators of overdose prevention centers in states and localities that have authorized or supported them.Last year, an average of 275 Americans died of a drug overdose every day.It is time to embrace bold strategies in the face of public health crises, even if they may seem radical at first. Thirty years ago, in the midst of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, New York City activists started one of the first syringe service programs in the country and, as a result, reduced HIV transmission among people who inject drugs, averting countless deaths. Advertisement     We urge the Biden administration to endorse overdose prevention centers, empowering state and local jurisdictions to fully leverage their resources and authority to build healthier and safer cities, towns, and communities.Dr. Dave A.

The spread of fentanyl — a dangerous, synthetic opioid 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine and the primary driver of the rise in overdoses — exponentially increases the need for even more overdose prevention innovation. Advertisement     Thirty years of research conducted across 100 sites on three continents has demonstrated the efficacy of overdose prevention centers. There has never been a single overdose death at any site. Participants are provided with basic human needs day after day: a smile, a sandwich, or a shower. Over time, trust is built between participants and clinical staff, which leads to participants beginning substance use disorder treatment and referrals to healthcare and other social services.In addition, research shows overdose prevention centers reduce public drug use, syringe litter, and drug-related crime in surrounding neighborhoods. They can also function as safe havens for women who use drugs, reducing violence against women associated with street-based substance use.We believe the overdose prevention centers in New York City will be a model for other cities to follow.Biden recently embraced harm reduction, becoming the first president to include it in his drug policy priorities.In another first, Congress appropriated $30 million in the American Rescue Plan to be provided to state, local, and tribal governments and organizations for overdose prevention and harm reduction services.State governments are also supporting the approach, with Rhode Island legalizing a two-year pilot of overdose prevention centers and other states introducing bills supporting the operation.This is not enough. Significant legal obstacles to widespread operation of overdose prevention centers remain, and the Biden administration has the power to remove them.Currently, a federal law, the Controlled Substances Act, states that it is illegal to operate, own, or rent a location for the purpose of using illegal substances. In April, New York joined San Francisco, Oakland, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Somerville, Massachusetts, in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland requesting he deprioritize enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act against overdose prevention centers. But so far, no action has been taken.The Department of Justice can also issue a memorandum to federal law enforcement to not prosecute the operators of overdose prevention centers in states and localities that have authorized or supported them.Last year, an average of 275 Americans died of a drug overdose every day.It is time to embrace bold strategies in the face of public health crises, even if they may seem radical at first. Thirty years ago, in the midst of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, New York City activists started one of the first syringe service programs in the country and, as a result, reduced HIV transmission among people who inject drugs, averting countless deaths. Advertisement     We urge the Biden administration to endorse overdose prevention centers, empowering state and local jurisdictions to fully leverage their resources and authority to build healthier and safer cities, towns, and communities.Dr. Dave A.

327,The Yoto Player is your ticket to parenting heaven.,"


Few things are as ferociously adorable as new babies are to parents. You simply cannot get enough of them. Whenever you're apart, it's a deprivation. How many times have we as parents found ourselves standing motionless beside a sleeping newborn at 3 a.m. in an unlit bedroom like the woman from Paranormal Activity?But that glorious little window slams shut pretty quickly a few months in when you need to make a phone call that really can't be interrupted or have an adult conversation for literally one minute or you simply MUST poop in peace for once. In the ensuing years, one of your unrelenting goals as a parent on certain days will be convincing your child to engage in some ""leave me alone time"" or its cousins “leave ALL adults alone” time and ""How can you be ‘bored’? Look at all these toys."" Advertisement     
 


Now, there are tools to aid you in this effort *cough* tablets *cough*, but they sometimes demand parental compromises that can be tough to stomach: Do you *really* want your kid watching THAT much Blippi (who by the way has a fascinating origin story)? What’s the maximum number of proto-fascist Paw Patrol episodes you’re willing to stomach? Do you really want to suffer feelings of shame and horror when you once again wonder if you should have opted for the natural wood Montessori toys instead of that horrible VTech walker that has permanently burned the lyric ""Welcome to Our Learning Farm” into your brain?That’s why I recommend the Yoto Player, a small, children's book–playing audio device that even very young kids can use themselves.
 


The Yoto Player is a square box with friendly orange knobs that uses “book” cards that children can easily choose, insert, and play. For many titles, it displays simple pixel art that goes along with the story. The player offers a range of children’s titles aimed at ages 3 to 12 — various Marvel and Disney princess collections, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and the Magic Tree House series, for example. The cards run about $8–$12 a pop, which is about as much as a board book and cheaper than a hardcover.
 


The device also has a selection of kid-friendly podcasts from public radio and other sources, including Yoto’s own daily podcast on the Yoto app, which you can burn onto a blank card. Cards for Kidz Bop music, Caspar Babypants, and holiday songs are available. And it can function as a white noise machine, night-light, or alarm clock if you need it to.Priced at $99, the Yoto Player isn’t particularly cheap (though the company does offer a $59 “mini” version with fewer features). And yes, there are audiobooks on CDs and Spotify and YouTube. But CD players are too delicate for a 3-year-old, and playing content on Spotify may mean abdicating control of your phone or some other screened device you’d rather keep. And don’t get me started on YouTube.
 


But that’s all beside the point, really. Because wouldn’t you pay almost anything for even a remote chance of getting sweet, sweet time to yourself while your child does something vaguely educational?To be clear, there is some risk involved here. It’s not a guaranteed hit. My 5-year-old son, who loves books, had little interest in the Yoto Player after he got tired of messing around with the device's knobs and playing the “crackling fire” sound effect card. In fact, as I was looking at the Yoto for this review, he yelled, “I hate that thing!” Advertisement     But when some friends visited us recently, their 3-year-old daughter spotted the Yoto and a Frozen card and happily walked off with them. A few moments later, we found her quietly listening to Elsa stories in another room. She did this for a deliciously long time. It was the dream. Meanwhile, her first-grade brother, who can now read on his own, had little interest.So why am I recommending this even if there’s a decent chance your kid won’t like it? Because what if they do? A kid who can happily entertain themselves with their own little book-reading gadget that they themself can use and doesn’t require a long-suffering parent to do the Elephant and Piggie voices for the 50th time? My god, that’s your ticket to parenting heaven. If it actually works out for you and your kid, you can thank me later.(Yoto loaned us a device for a limited evaluation period.

328,"The Ohio branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations has fired one of its top executives for spying on behalf of an ""anti-Muslim hate group.""","


The Ohio branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations has fired one of its top executives for spying on behalf of an ""anti-Muslim hate group,"" the organization's national headquarters said in a statement Tuesday.CAIR National executive director Nihad Awad said that CAIR Ohio's now-former executive and legal director Romin Iqbal ""was secretly sharing confidential information about our civil rights work — including surreptitiously recorded conversations, strategic plans and private emails — with anti-Muslim extremists."" Advertisement     Awad identified the group with which Iqbal was working as the Investigative Project on Terrorism, IPT, a nonprofit whose mission statement is ""to research and expose the activities of terrorist networks and supporters in the US and abroad and to educate the public about this threat."" However, IPT has been criticized by watchdog groups such as the Southern Poverty Law Center for its anti-Muslim rhetoric. The group was founded by Steven Emerson, a right-wing activist ""with a history of promoting falsified information and conspiracy theories about Islam and Muslims,"" according to a Georgetown University initiative that researches hostility toward Muslims.CAIR's statement said that last year its national office received ""extensive and unprecedented information"" about IPT as part of the organization's work combatting anti-Muslim groups. In these documents, CAIR said, it found that IPT ""had spent years trying to infiltrate and spy upon prominent mosques and Muslim American organizations using 'moles' among their staff and volunteers.""A lawyer for Iqbal declined to comment to the Columbus Dispatch and didn't immediately respond to BuzzFeed News.IPT did not deny working with Iqbal or spying on CAIR in a statement to BuzzFeed News. ""While the Investigative Project on Terrorism has never and will never monitor the wider American Muslim community, it will not hesitate to uncover and publicly expose radical Islamist activity on American soil by groups like CAIR, which threaten our national security,"" the statement read. Advertisement     The group did not respond to CAIR's allegation that Emerson and IPT were ""communicating with and providing assistance to Israeli intelligence"" about American Muslim organizations while Benjamin Netanyahu was prime minister of Israel.When the national office saw that CAIR's Columbus, Ohio, chapter was one of IPT's targets, it hired an outside law firm and forensic investigator to determine whether the information was accurate and if Emerson's group had been able to infiltrate the organization. After months of investigation, the third-party team found evidence that Iqbal — and Iqbal alone — had been working with the group ""for years.""In a separate statement, CAIR-Ohio described Iqbal's actions as a ""betrayal and violation of trust [that] was planned and purposeful."" Iqbal had worked at the organization since 2008; he was named the chapter's executive director in 2018. According to the statement, he confessed when presented with evidence and was formally fired on Tuesday. The organization said that it is currently investigating whether or not Iqbal used CAIR-Ohio's resources to purchase weapons and ammunition.""In the wake of Iqbal’s termination, the Columbus office of CAIR-Ohio has discovered suspicious purchases from ammunition and gun retailers made in recent weeks using a CAIR-Ohio credit card that Iqbal administered,"" CAIR-Ohio said. In its statement, the chapter said that on Tuesday a package containing parts for an AR-15 rifle was delivered to the Columbus office. Ohio law enforcement is investigating.CAIR-Ohio spokesperson Whitney Siddiqi said in a press briefing Wednesday that the group is contemplating legal action.

There were plenty of predictable new tech things in 2021, like the latest iPhones or laptops. These are some of the weird, fun, or just useful things we tried out and actually recommend — from e-bikes to a cheapo phone stand, guitar pedals, and even a ’70s-style role-playing game.These items were independently selected by staff and except where noted, they spent their own money on it.

AirPods Max — $549 at AppleLook, Apple’s AirPods Max are some expensive headphones — like months'-worth-of-groceries expensive (Apple loaned BuzzFeed a pair to review.) And let’s be honest, your current earbuds probably sound pretty great and have more daily use cases. But if you feel you need over-ear headphones, the AirPods Max are a really good choice. They pump out clear, gloriously rich sound with solid separation. I am no audiophile, so I’ll not belabor this with “omg a unique magnesium cone!” minutiae. What I will say is that these headphones adeptly handled everything I threw at them, from the most annoyingly quiet Sufjan Stevens to colon-rupturing Swedish math metal. And they nailed the low note on Beastie Boys’ “Shake Your Rump,” which is the bass metric all headphones should be judged on. Beyond this, they’re thoughtfully designed, though their precious little charging purse is a bit much. So, yeah, if you’re intent on purchasing some high-end headphones, you’re not going to go wrong with these. But also: Groceries are a fun thing to have. —John Paczkowski Advertisement  
 


Casper Glow Light — $116 at CasperIt’s a very nice ambient light. You spin it to make it brighter or dimmer, which is both fun and handy. I use it as a bedside light and also as mood lighting in the living room when I watch TV at night. Then I can shut everything off and go to the bathroom or back to bed using just this light, which makes me feel like I’m in an old-timey movie using a candlestick. Convenient and pleasant! —Shannon Keating Advertisement  
 


Apple AirTags for my TV remote and rubber remote case — AirTags: $29 for one or $99 for four at Apple. Case: $7.99 at Amazon.The remote is by far the worst part of the older-model Apple TVs. It’s somehow super slippery in your hand and so light it feels hard to control. It’s super thin and small, the perfect size for losing between couch cushions. The newest 4K Apple TVs come with an improved remote, which is sold separately for $59, but that’s way more than I want to spend.So instead I put one of these rubber covers on my current remote. It makes it grippy and easy to hold, and the bright color is easy to find, which was great until my toddler decided it is her most coveted toy. Finding the remote very quickly became a daily, sometimes hourly issue. Either my daughter had run off with it, or an adult had hidden it from her to prevent that from happening. Advertisement  So I AirTagged the remote. The case has a special slot to accommodate Apple’s little item-tracking device. The “Precision Finding” feature in the iPhone’s Find My app makes it easy to find lost things like TV remotes with a visual tracking feature that approximates how far away an item is. And the extra weight the AirTag adds to the remote feels nice in the hand. If you’re only ever going to track a TV remote, you might consider Tile’s cheaper tracking device, but if you’re an iPhone person prone to misplacing more than one item (I wanted one for my keychain as well as my husband’s keys and one to stick in our car for the times I forgot where I parked), then the AirTag four-pack makes a lot of sense (Apple loaned me AirTags for review, but I liked them enough I bought my own.) —Katie Notopoulos
 


Janome 2212 sewing machine — $199 at AmazonAt some point last winter, I developed an itch for making things with my hands. I dreamed of becoming a DIY person, and that dream wore out my credit card. I bought paint, canvases, 10 balls of yarn, knitting needles, embroidery hoops, a hot glue gun that’s still sitting in my drawer, unopened. And in my frenzy, I also got a sewing machine, a Janome 2212 that Google led me to believe was “an easy sewing machine for beginners.”To my great surprise, it was not easy. Sewing machines have too many knobs and too many labels, too many sections to thread your string through and around, and yet are so finicky that you have to wonder why we’ve gone to the moon but can’t make a simpler, more efficient machine for sewing. It’s a messy and frustrating hobby, and it will fill up your room with scrap fabric and half-finished projects. I’ve lost entire days using this thing. I’ve made dresses, I’ve altered sweaters, and I’ve watched hours of YouTube tutorials explaining what the hell a French seam is and how to sew a zipper on. You have to follow instructions and be patient, two qualities I don’t care for. None of the clothes I’ve made have ever come out well; there’s always a loose thread somewhere and wonky stitching. But it’s also, somehow, meditative, and when you’re out in a dress you made and someone asks where it’s from, you get to say, “Thanks, I made it. Just don’t look too closely.” —Clarissa-Jan Lim
 


RadRover 6 Plus electric bike — $1,999 at Rad Power BikesI can’t afford the RadRover 6 Plus electric bike, but I was lucky enough to try it (Rad Power Bikes loaned BuzzFeed a bike to review) and, yes, I liked it. Loved it, actually. And I say that as someone who has never quite understood the electric bike phenomenon. But after this bike took me to a favorite fishing hole at 22 mph and then off-roaded me up a poorly maintained trail right to the water without requiring really anything of me or my rickety knee, I get it. I am not a bike expert. My last bike was stolen, and the one before that was a trashed Huffy Thunder Road. But I found the RadRover to be pretty amazing, though it is quite heavy and built like a small motorcycle. Great ride, good battery life, and very easy to use — even for e-bike Luddites like me. —John Paczkowski
 


Plasma Coil guitar pedal — $350 from Third ManThough you undoubtedly know Jack White best for his guitar work in bands like the White Stripes and the Raconteurs, he's doing some equally amazing things with Third Man Records, an independent label and, most importantly for the purposes of this review, a purveyor of a guitar pedal called the Plasma Coil. This is an apt name for a pedal that distorts the notes you play on a guitar by expressing them as a electrical discharges *you can see* courtesy a xenon gas–filled tube. Designed by Gamechanger Audio, the Plasma Coil literally amplifies audio signals to 3,500 volts. It sounds as badass as it looks — like a 50-pound wasp nest. It’s pretty much lightning in a box and an absolute blast to play. And if you dig the Plasma Coil, it’s worth noting that a few of Third Man’s other pedals are equally impressive, including the Bumble Buzz, (a sick fuzz box) and the Triplegraph (a digital octave pedal with individual octave-up and octave-down channels that make your guitar sound like a noise in a science fiction movie). —John Paczkowski
 


The Fantasy Trip: Legacy Edition role-playing game — $119 at AmazonSince I was (a) locked down at home and (b) no longer commuting, I had extra hours and nostalgia for the role-playing game of my adolescence — a criminally simple and fun one called the Fantasy Trip. Popular for its single-player adventures back in the 1970s and perfect for the pandemic era, the game was revived two years ago by its original designer in a legacy edition. A throwback to the mayhem-flavored era of pen-and-paper games, the easy but elegant rules allow for intriguing match-ups against monsters represented by cardboard square game pieces that evoke the era when light beer was new. Anyone who’s bored stiff at the thought of learning the latest gaudy Dungeons & Dragons rules but wants to bump off a band of bugbears, or who’s middle-aged enough to try to entice (force) your kids to do so with easy-to-learn rules, might give it a shot. I managed after a few tries to get my band of paper bravoes through a death test dungeon after a few weekends of on-and-off playing, and it has been a solace on rainy weekends ever since. In a nice mixture of old and new, I now play it over Roll20.net with an old high school buddy now living in Germany. —Dan Vergano
 


Lamicall metal phone stand — $9.99 at AmazonIn 2021, this became an essential part of my workstation. It allows my phone to act as a second screen (technically a third screen, since I already use a laptop plus a monitor). I previously had a flat wood stand that held the phone in a way that completely covered its speakers and microphone, making it impossible for video calling. This metal style also allows you to charge while on the stand. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Anker Nebula Cosmos 4K projector — $699 at AmazonWho needs a TV when any flat surface in your home is a screen? Anker’s Cosmos projector is remarkably good at playing movies on bare white walls with a clarity of picture and sound that will satisfy most everyone but AV aficionados. With Dolby Digital Plus 360° theatrical audio and a sharp 1080p resolution, a 900 ANSI Lumen autofocus display that can be recalibrated almost instantly and sharpened with the press of a button, the Cosmos solidly and accurately plays everything from home movies on a bedroom wall to Aliens on a bedsheet in your backyard. It runs Google’s Android TV, so it supports Netflix, YouTube, and a host of other apps right out of the box (Anker loaned BuzzFeed a projector to review.)—John Paczkowski Advertisement  
 


LectroFan white noise machine — $45 at AmazonFour mammals live in my home, and we all need our beauty rest. The busy New York City block we live on poses challenges: barflies late at night, trash trucks first thing in the morning, and every other imaginable city noise in the hours between. That’s why we swear by white noise machines. My wife and I share one. My 18-month-old falls asleep to one. Even my dog, my sweet, neurotic Chihuahua-dachshund, has a white noise machine on top of his crate. He gets scared, OK? —Joe Bernstein Advertisement     
 


Facebook Portal Go — $199 at PortalYes, there’s an irony that despite everything that BuzzFeed News has reported about Facebook over the past few years, I am recommending a Facebook product. If you want to feel truly pure about not supporting Meta, Facebook’s new parent company, well, go ahead and delete your Instagram account. It probably makes more money off showing you ads than the company would off a hardware purchase. I’ll wait.The truth is, the Portal is a great video chatting device. The smart camera follows you around the room and can accommodate more than one face at a time. It’s great for connecting distant grandparents and small kids, particularly the rechargeable Portal Go, which can be carried from room to room. My kid loves taking Grandma out into the yard to show off his toys and adventures. Advertisement     When I first tested the Go (Facebook loaned BuzzFeed a Portal to review), my one big complaint was that there was no way to fully disable the “Watch Together” function during a call, which can be an issue if you want to control the videos your kids watch. Meta’s head of VR and Portal promised to fix this. So starting in December, you can block Watch Together completely during calls. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Vilo mesh Wi-Fi routers — $70 for three at AmazonYou may have heard of this “mesh Wi-Fi” thing from your friends who have bigger houses and more tech smarts than you. The Vilo is the mesh router for everyone else. The idea is that instead of one crappy router you stash under your bed, you evenly space three futuristic white bricks throughout your house. As you walk from room to room, you’ll always have a clear, strong Wi-Fi connection. Why would someone who lives in a small Brooklyn apartment need three Wi-Fi routers? The obvious answer is: Why the hell not? Vilos are about $70 for three and surprisingly attractive for a router. By comparison, a fancy mesh system from Google is $349. Wirecutter’s “budget pick” is still $130. I loathe spending money, but these guys just make sense. —Scott PhamOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News
"
330,"According to Ben, there was a lot to consider before taking the leap.","Looking back on the year, I think we can all agree that the return of Bennifer was the love story our hearts needed. And while Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez’s power couple comeback appeared to seamlessly unfold before our eyes this summer, it seems that the decision to go public with their relationship wasn’t an easy one to make. Speaking to Howard Stern on Monday, Ben revealed that there was a lot to consider before he and Jen decided to pick up where they left off, 17 years after they called off their engagement in 2004. Stern began by noting that Ben and Jen’s comeback was bound to attract a lot of attention from the media and public, and proceeded to ask the actor if this was a concern to him in the early stages of their reunion. “The relationship now, I see you’re with Jennifer,” the host began. “That even brings more attention to you. You’ve been through the scene when you’re constantly in the tabloids,” he added, a seeming reference to the intense media scrutiny surrounding Ben’s past struggles with alcohol addiction. “Was there hesitation on your part, because now you’re a dad?” Stern asked. “Was there hesitation on your part to say, you know, ‘I can’t go through this again?’” In response, the Argo director revealed that his main apprehension was the risk that the relationship — and accompanying media frenzy — might negatively impact his children. “It crossed my mind for sure,” Ben said of his concerns before resuming the romance. “My responsibility to my children is the highest responsibility,” he said. “I don’t want to do anything that is painful or destructive to them if I can help it.” Ben shares three children — Violet, 16, Seraphina, 12, and Samuel, 9 — with his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner. In light of their famous parents, Ben opened up about how the public attention that has surrounded his children can be difficult for him to navigate. “My life affects them,"" he said. ""Me and their mom are celebrities. That is hard. That is a cross to bear."" Ben and Garner got married in 2005, just a year after he and J.Lo announced that they had called off their engagement. After 10 years together, he and Garner announced their split in a joint statement in 2015, and their divorce was later finalized in October 2018. Speaking to Stern about the ""horrible"" tabloid coverage of his and Garner's high-profile divorce, Ben explained that their children were at the forefront of the decision to end their marriage. “The truth was we took our time, we made the decision, we grew apart,” he said of the demise of their relationship. “We had a marriage that didn't work,” he went on. “We tried because we had kids. We did not want it to be the model of marriage for the kids. We did our best. I knew she was a good mom, and I hoped she knew I was a good dad.” During their marriage, Ben sought treatment in rehab for alcohol addiction on several occasions in 2008, 2017, and again in 2018 after their divorce was finalized. In the past, he has spoken about how his addiction was the catalyst for their split. Now, talking candidly about his relationship with alcohol, Ben told Stern that difficulties in his marriage to Garner had been “part of why” he developed a drinking problem. Before explaining that he had felt “trapped” in the marriage, the Oscar winner said that he’d “probably still be drinking” if he and Garner were still together. “I'd probably still be drinking,” he said. ""It's part of why I started drinking … because I was trapped."" He continued: “I was like ‘I can't leave because of my kids, but I'm not happy. What do I do?’ What I did was drink a bottle of scotch and fall asleep on the couch, which turned out not to be the solution.” In spite of those comments, Ben has previously credited his ex-wife for her support throughout his recovery. In a 2017 Facebook post in which he announced that he had completed treatment for his addiction, the father of three expressed gratitude for his friends and family, and went on to praise Garner specifically. “I'm lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I set out to do,” Ben wrote at the time. “This was the first of many steps being taken towards a positive recovery.” In October this year, Ben and Garner were spotted together with their three children celebrating Halloween in Malibu. The exes were also joined by Ben’s new partner, Jennifer Lopez, as well as her 13-year-old twins — Emme and Max — whom she shares with Marc Anthony. At the time, a source told People that all is well between the trio, and that they are navigating their new family dynamic with their respective kids at the center. “Everyone gets along and the focus is always on the kids. Jennifer, Ben and Jen Garner all wanted the kids to have an amazing Halloween,” the source revealed. “The kids are friends and wanted to go trick-or-treating together.”"
331,"The US death toll from COVID-19 has passed 800,000, a once-unthinkable number that became reality as conspiracies fueled vaccine hesitancy and sent many Americans towards preventable deaths.","


Think back — for a moment, if you can — to the start of the pandemic.Try to recall the first time you heard of the novel coronavirus or COVID-19 or social distancing.Remember the night of March 11, 2020, when Tom Hanks got sick and the NBA shut down and suddenly everything seemed real.How bad did you think it would get?When the first Americans started dying — in your state, in your city, in your neighborhood, perhaps even in your family — and you saw the death tolls start to rise, where did you think they would climb to? Advertisement     When newspaper front pages declared 100,000 dead was an “incalculable loss,” what words did you imagine, if any, they might find to describe a figure eight times that?As of Tuesday, more than 800,000 Americans have now died from COVID-19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Not even experts can believe it’s come to this.“This number was unthinkable to me,” said Georges C. Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association. “I was quite frankly astounded when we went over 100,000. But this number makes me very uncomfortable, and what makes me most uncomfortable and concerned is that the loss of this much life was preventable.”
 


Bob Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said that never in a million years did he imagine the death toll would get this high. He’s been consistently surprised in the pandemic — first by the lethality of the original novel coronavirus, then the transmissibility of the Delta variant, and finally by the reluctance of many to take a lifesaving vaccine.“2021 has a different feeling than 2020,” Wachter said. “2020 was a natural catastrophe and terrible things happen in catastrophes the way they do in bad earthquakes and tsunamis, and although the government response was really muddled, a lot of these deaths were unavoidable.”“2021 feels very different,” he added. “It feels like most of the deaths were preventable and unnecessary, and in some ways that makes it doubly sad.”
 


Over the last 18-plus months, the tools to prevent yourself from getting infected have become gradually less onerous, shifting from extreme lockdowns and self-isolation to face-masking to vaccination.Now, with safe and highly effective COVID vaccines widely available in the US, many unvaccinated Americans are essentially choosing a path toward preventable death.Unvaccinated Americans are roughly six times more likely to be diagnosed with COVID and 20 more times to die from it, according to multiple analyses. Another study from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that at least 90,000 people — mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, friends and strangers — died unnecessarily between June and September alone because they had not been vaccinated. Many more have died since.“We still have people who don't believe the disease is real. We have people who don't believe the disease is real on their deathbed,” Benjamin said. “And we have people who continue to foster that misinformation.”Vaccine hesitancy and refusal are phenomena that are present in countries around the world, but like many things in the US, they have been especially poisoned by politics. If you live in a county that voted for Donald Trump in the 2020 election, you’re much less likely to be vaccinated than residents in counties who voted for Joe Biden. Deaths are subsequently higher in Trump counties. In October, 25 out of every 100,000 residents in strongly Trump counties died from COVID, compared to just 7.8 per 100,000 in strongly Biden counties.This attitude in sections of the American right has been aided and abetted by the conservative media that caters to them, including the country’s most-watched cable news channel. Fox News aired claims undermining COVID vaccines every single night — save for just two — between April and September, according to a count by the liberal watchdog group Media Matters.“I never thought I’d see this kind of irresponsibility from elected officials and people in the media because that’s what it is,” Benjamin said.
 


The rate at which Americans are continuing to die from the virus — still roughly 1,500 per day — is staggering. Barely two months have passed since we hit 700,000, a figure that was also dubbed a “completely avoidable milestone” and “an American tragedy.”In total, there has been more than 50 million cases of COVID-19 in the US — another milestone reached just this week. One out of every 100 Americans aged 65 and over has died from the virus.But now, with a potentially even more transmissible Omicron variant beginning to circulate, experts fear that rate could spike further as Americans endure yet another dark winter. Continued complacency could make things even worse.“It’s very clear that this number of deaths to the public has almost become background noise,” Wachter said. “That’s tragic because it just is, but also because it leads us to let our guards down and not respond in a way that could be appropriate.”“Omicron has led to wall-to-wall news coverage. There’s been a major uptick in vaccinations. But Omicron has so far killed very few people,” Wachter added. “The much greater risk is from Delta than Omicron, but that risk was not getting people to do what they needed to do because they really are no longer paying that much attention.”There has been progress. In the US, November saw the longest uptick in vaccinations in months and that was before the discovery of Omicron. More than 237 million Americans, over 71% of the population, have now had at least one vaccine. Children aged over 5 can also now get their doses, as their anxious parents exhale just a little.We also know infinitely more about the virus now than we did when it first appeared in headlines, noted Benjamin, including how to test for it, treat it, and prevent it. “I’m hopeful that we’ve made progress and I believe that we have,” he said. “I can see the end of this, but it ain’t next week.” Advertisement     It is customary in stories like this — stories that you, like other readers, have probably become numb to by now — to make obtuse comparisons in order to try to give a sense of the scale of the death toll. We can do that for a moment. More Americans have died of COVID than those who live in North Dakota, Alaska, the District of Columbia, Vermont, or Wyoming. It is as if the entire metropolitan populations of Seattle, Denver, or Boston had been wiped off the map. In less than two years, more Americans have died of COVID than those who have died in the four-decade AIDS pandemic. The toll is vastly higher than the number who died in the Civil War.But those contrasts themselves can sometimes feel overwhelming and ineffective.Instead, perhaps, go smaller. Focus on the individuals who died, maybe even just since summer waned and the weather got colder.Among them was a 54-year-old Navy veteran in Pennsylvania, who loved gardening and going to flea markets with his partner.And a 13-year-old boy with sickle cell anemia in Arizona, who was passionate about WWE wrestling.And a beloved 70-year-old mother in Washington, who was finally starting to overcome her hesitation to getting a shot and whose family, after her death, found in her phone the last words she’d ever typed into Google: “Where to find a COVID vaccine.”

333,The New Hampshire Voter Integrity Group is one of many volunteer efforts searching for Donald Trump’s claims of voter fraud.,"


The man at the door said he was just there to verify some publicly available information.In the home security video, he seems nervous and out of breath as he waits at the doorway, glancing frequently at his phone. Strangers don’t knock on doors much in Waterville Valley, New Hampshire, a small ski town. For a decade, it had just 250 year-round residents, until the pandemic hit and a bunch of Massachusetts residents decided to cross state lines and turn their rural vacation spot into a home. But the man at the door wasn’t one of them. He said his name was Dean and he was with the New Hampshire Voter Integrity Group.The homeowner knew right away something was up, he said later in an interview. He didn’t go to answer the door, but spoke to the man through his Ring camera, pressing him on what exactly the New Hampshire Voter Integrity Group was and who they represented. In the video shared with BuzzFeed News, Dean, haltingly, says they are volunteers. They don’t represent anybody but themselves. They are just trying to verify the town’s voter rolls. The homeowner keeps pressing, and finally Dean gets to the point: “[We] took a look at the election so we’re a little concerned about what happened, so we’re, uh, checking.” Advertisement  The homeowner, a Democrat, tells him to go to hell and get off his property. “That’ll be a nice trip, thank you,” Dean replies cheerfully in the security footage as he turns to leave. “I’ll see you there.”
 


Around town that Saturday in early October, other people were knocking on doors — specific ones, the rare ones where people actually live year-round — asking about the 2020 election. They had information on the residents, their names, whether they voted and if they did so in-person or absentee. In response, two Waterville Valley residents called the cops, according to a police report.Across the country, the pro-Trump conspiracy theory internet is manifesting itself into knocks at the door. Individual election deniers and grassroots groups are canvassing for election fraud in states lost or even won by former president Donald Trump in 2020, including New Hampshire, Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, North Carolina, Utah, and Nebraska. Despite 60-plus court losses and countless official audits and recounts confirming the 2020 election results, many of Trump’s supporters are still so convinced of his lies that they’ve turned to this kind of vigilantism.It’s all part of a broader effort by Trump supporters — emboldened and given tacit support by Republican Party leaders — to deny the 2020 election results at all costs and cast doubt on elections going forward. When a contractor working on the Arizona Senate’s partisan and farcical “audit” proposed a similar door-knocking scheme last spring, the Justice Department warned that it could violate federal laws on voter intimidation. The Senate backed off, but volunteers did the canvass anyway and put out a sloppy report alleging all kinds of fraud without evidence to back it up. Though reporters quickly debunked their claims — including finding a house on the alleged “vacant” property gracing the report’s cover — the Arizona canvass results went viral on right-wing social media and have inspired copycats. Advertisement  A member of the far-right Three Percenters militant group is helping lead the canvassing effort in Colorado, where a leader suggested volunteers carrying firearms could help secure the group as they went door-to-door, according to the Colorado Times Recorder. The Utah Voter Verification Project is requiring its volunteer canvassers to sign NDAs before they canvass and has instructed them to record their interactions with voters, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. The sheriff’s office in Buffalo County, Nebraska, posted on Facebook on Nov. 4, warning about similar canvassing efforts and telling voters that the canvassers were not official or affiliated with the county.The New Hampshire Voter Integrity Group claims to be nonpartisan. Its founder, Marylyn Todd, a 37-year-old from Nashua, told BuzzFeed News in an interview that she is registered as an independent. Todd claimed in a Facebook message that “many” of their canvassers voted for President Joe Biden, but would not name them or connect them with BuzzFeed News. Todd also said that she has expanded canvassing across the state, focusing on towns where the group believes there is the most potential fraud, but she declined to name the towns they’ve visited. The group, she said, “is just trying to get to the bottom of the truth, nothing more, nothing less.”Members of the group credit Dean, whose last name Todd declined to provide, with creating the app they use to track down voters. (Dean did not respond to questions messaged to his Telegram account nor to questions Todd said she shared with him via email.) The app is designed with a free site that Democrats have used in the past to canvass voters before an election. The app shows canvassers where to find nearby voters, as well as their addresses, whether they voted in 2020, if they voted in person or absentee, and whether they registered to vote same-day. The app asks canvassers to confirm that information and, if they find any discrepancies, to get voters to sign an affidavit and mail it to a P.O. box. Advertisement  
 


Todd said they are sharing those affidavits with members of the state legislature, “many” of whom are interested in their findings, but declined to provide names. She described affidavits the group collected from two households alleging election misconduct, but declined to share any names or details that could be fact-checked, citing the affiants’ privacy. The Trump campaign used affidavits as part of its failed legal strategy to challenge the 2020 election and held up the sworn statements to try to add some legitimacy to its bogus fraud claims, but, as the Washington Post noted at the time, many of those affidavits were never filed in court and the ones that were filed were often thrown out. Advertisement  BuzzFeed News was able to access the New Hampshire Voter Integrity Group’s canvassing app using a link they included in a YouTube video. All of the voter information included in the app, along with a voter’s party identification, is public information and can be accessed through a right to know request at the state or local level, New Hampshire Deputy Secretary of State David Scanlan confirmed.The New Hampshire Voter Integrity Group began its canvassing in Waterville Valley and Rye, a town more than 100 miles southeast of Waterville Valley along the state’s coast. Both cities voted overwhelmingly for Biden and Waterville Valley residents offered a few theories as to why they may have caught election conspiracy theorists’ attention. For one, Waterville Valley’s population has boomed during the pandemic to about double its size. If you were to take a look at turnout there and compare it to previous elections, you’d see a huge spike. For another, the Waterville Valley ski resort is owned by the family of Republican Gov. Chris Sununu — who is often referred to as a “dictator,” a “traitor,” and a “communist” by members of the group. The governor maintains an ownership interest in the family investment group that owns the resort, according to the Associated Press, and he was CEO of the resort before he took office in 2017.Todd said that Sununu’s ties to the area had nothing to do with the New Hampshire Voter Integrity Group's focus on Waterville Valley; it and Rye were just the “two worst towns in New Hampshire,” according to the group’s analysis of the 2020 election. That analysis, which is posted on its Facebook page, claims that more than 200% of Waterville Valley’s population was registered to vote in 2020. The fine print notes that those figures are based on 2019 Census data — before the town’s population boom. Todd said the figures were actually based on data from New Hampshire Employment Security, a state agency, which also has 2019 population data for the town. Asked about the discrepancy and informed of Waterville Valley’s growth in 2020, Todd emphasized that her group’s reports are “preliminary” and that she would look into the new Census data. Advertisement  Rye Town Clerk Donna Decotis said her town got “an abundance” of calls from concerned residents when the New Hampshire Voter Integrity Group started knocking on doors there. She advised them of their rights: “They did not have to speak. They do not have to open the door.”Three Waterville Valley residents who spoke to BuzzFeed News for this story asked that their full names not be used for fear of retribution. It’s a small town. People talk. And a group of conspiracy-minded strangers already turned up at their front doors.The New Hampshire Voter Integrity Group explicitly tells volunteers not to talk about any political party and never to ask who someone voted for, in part because of the Justice Department’s letter, Todd said, though she disagrees with DOJ’s conclusion. But one Waterville Valley resident said that’s exactly what two people at his doorway asked him — at which point he gave them five seconds to leave. The canvassers did clear out, but the man said he was furious that “two dumbasses” had come calling asking about personal information. Advertisement  “I was enraged,” he said. “I am to this day offended at the whole notion that there was any widescale election fraud. … I was like, sputtering mad. I called the police dispatch.”Waterville Valley police determined that no laws had been broken, according to the police report, but the officer told the canvassers that people in a small town like that weren’t used to strangers coming to their doors.Scanlan, a Republican who pushed back on Trump’s voter fraud claims in 2016, said there’s nothing to prevent citizens from going door-to-door on any kind of survey, absent a local ordinance. Though he was familiar with the New Hampshire Voter Integrity Group from its protests at the state Capitol and local news reports, Scanlan said he personally hadn’t seen any complaints about the group’s canvassing efforts. “From our perspective, it’s part of democracy in New Hampshire and, you know, I have not heard of any activity that is inappropriate or illegal,” he said.But the Waterville Valley resident who called the police has only gotten angrier as he’s thought about canvassers at his door pushing the same conspiracy theories that led to Jan. 6. The way he sees it, the canvassers aren’t just looking for voter fraud, they’re proselytizing. “Once you start knocking on people’s doors and telling them that you’re part of a volunteer organization trying to hunt out voter fraud, you got to imagine that part of it is they’re looking for disciples.” Advertisement  
 


Todd rejected the notion that their canvassing efforts might be off-putting to voters, saying that their door knockers are mostly grandparents and they’re respectful. “I would say 99% of the people that we door-knocked are thanking us and they’re super happy that we’re doing this,” she said.When asked why, then, several people had called the police or the town of Rye and others shared their concerns with BuzzFeed News, Todd stuck to her 99% figure, saying voters wouldn’t be answering their questions if they weren’t happy about it. New Hampshire is just different, she said in a later Facebook message. “We love each other here!!! We respect each other here regardless of politics. We’re above all of that!!!” Advertisement  Whitney, a Biden voter in Waterville Valley whom BuzzFeed News is referring to by her middle name, said she initially answered the group’s questions when they came to her door because she had no idea what they were talking about. “I didn’t realize until much of the way through our conversation what they were trying to prove,” she said in an interview.She said it was “a very strange door-knocking” that “just felt stranger as the conversation went on,” but she eventually clocked what they were up to. “I just assumed by the end of the conversation they were looking to prove voter fraud in favor of Trump. Primarily because who else is talking about an election that’s way over?”All of this started with an actual election issue — hundreds of ballots in a state legislative race in Windham, a town where Todd owns property, that were miscounted in favor of a Democratic candidate. It turned out the problem was the way the ballots were folded, not fraud or malice, and the issue was caught and corrected following a bipartisan audit. But the problems in Windham helped give rise to the audit fever that has swept the far-right, propelled in part by local resident and former Trump 2016 campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.Todd does not believe the fold explanation and remains extremely bothered by the discrepancy in Windham. Her quest to find the real fraud there has snowballed into a self-described crusade. Her group is pushing for a statewide audit and canvass, conducted by Todd and her cadre of internet volunteers themselves if need be. They’ve grown to more than 5,000 members on a private Facebook page that is littered with misinformation, anti-vaccine sentiments, and QAnon slogans. (Todd said she’s asked her moderators to block vaccine and Q-related content; she said she was not familiar with the “WWG1WGA” QAnon slogan littering the comments on the page and thought it was related to “What Would Jesus Do.”) Advertisement  Todd is new to all of this. She said she didn’t even know what a state representative was before February and that she “barely voted” before this year, but she now leads a group that has acquired the voting machine tapes and voter information for nearly every town in the state by filing a bunch of public information requests and going in-person to get their data. Todd is clearly passionate and believes her work as an auditor for an accounting firm gave her the experience to do her own audit of New Hampshire’s election. She took a leave of absence from that job in February to focus on what she calls their citizens audit. “Did I know that I was still going to be here almost a year later on a leave of absence?” she said, laughing. “No. But, you know, auditing a whole state isn’t as easy as I originally thought it was.”In just Waterville Valley and Rye, Todd claimed in a Facebook video that they’ve found “a little over 15% of phantom voters,” which she defines as “people that didn’t vote and that all of sudden there’s an absentee ballot cast in their name.”The Waterville Valley homeowner who told Dean to go to hell was particularly surprised that the group chose his town to canvass because it’s so small and because it uses paper ballots in its elections. He used to volunteer as a vote tabulator for Waterville Valley and told BuzzFeed News that voters mark their ballots with pencil and tabulators count them by hand. “It’s not like there’s any kind of tampering going on because there’s too many people around,” he said. “So I know what the election process is here in this little town, and for somebody to come here and say that there was inconsistencies with the election, I just thought was ridiculous.” Advertisement     Likewise, Decotis, the town clerk in Rye, was taken aback when the New Hampshire Voter Integrity Group suggested there was voter fraud in her town. Decotis has helped out with Rye’s elections for years. “​​Like I said to them, we run a good election here,” she said. “Our numbers always match.”The New Hampshire Voter Integrity Group is still canvassing around Rye and other cities in the state. The group claims to have raised just under $75,000 this year and plans to spend $30,000 to produce a documentary about “election corruption” in New Hampshire.Todd told BuzzFeed News she was just crossing T's on a new app where anyone can check 2020 voting data for themselves and their neighbors, making sure that it is identical to the public information they got from their right-to-know requests. “You know, my life has already been affected so much from this that I just don't want it affected any more than it already is,” she said. Advertisement     She said she has not enjoyed her first foray into politics, repeatedly calling it “dirty” and “gross.” But almost a year after she started all of this, Todd plans to keep going. “It’s important for me to keep America, America. And when I saw this much opportunity [for fraud], it made me nervous for the future generations,” she said.If politics were less dirty, “if people were ethical,” she said, “I’d probably run for something.” ●

334,"Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity and Brian Kilmeade pleaded with his chief of staff Mark Meadows to have the then-president condemn and stop violent rioters during the Jan. 6 insurrection.","


Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity, and Brian Kilmeade — some of the most fervent defenders of Donald Trump — pleaded with his chief of staff Mark Meadows to have the then-president condemn and stop violent rioters as they attacked the Capitol during the Jan. 6 insurrection, according to newly revealed texts.Text messages from the hosts, unnamed Republican lawmakers, and even the former president's son Donald Trump Jr., were read out loud on Monday during a hearing of the congressional panel tasked with investigating the insurrection. The texts were sent to Meadows during the middle of the violence, pleading with him to get Trump to make a public statement to stop the attack. Advertisement     ""He's got to condemn this shit ASAP. The Capitol Police tweet is not enough,"" Donald Trump Jr.'s text said, according to excerpts read by Rep. Liz Cheney, vice chair of the panel.Cheney read some of the text messages that were turned over to the committee by Meadows as part of their investigation into the attack. On Monday, its members unanimously recommended the House vote to hold Meadows in contempt for his refusal to testify before them. The House is expected to consider the matter on Tuesday.The text messages showed the extent to which several Fox News personalities privately sought action from Trump, who was silent for hours during the insurrection. In spite of their desperate communications on Jan. 6, some of them would go on to downplay the violence at the Capitol.
 


""Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us,"" Ingraham texted Meadows at the time, according to Cheney's reading. ""He is destroying his legacy.""But in public, Ingraham would go on to later attack the accounts of Capitol officers who faced down the violent mob, dismissing their testimony before Congress as ""theatrics.""In a segment in July on The Ingraham Angle, Ingraham made fun of the officers with mock awards such as ""Best Use of Tears and Dramatic Pauses"" and ""Best Use of Exaggeration"" after they testified about the violence at the Capitol.Fox News has not addressed the texts as a network but, on Tuesday, Ingraham and Hannity spoke on air and stood by their comments.Ingraham called reports of the private texts as an effort to ""tar me as a liar, a hypocrite who privately sounded the alarm on Jan. 6, but publicly downplayed it.""She shared screenshots during her show of tweets from the day calling the attack ""disgraceful"" and asking Trump to ""tell everyone to leave the building now.""
 


Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade also reached out to Meadows on Jan. 6, according to Cheney.""Please get him on TV,"" Kilmeade texted. ""Destroying everything you have accomplished.""Hannity, a fierce supporter of Trump, also texted Meadows in an effort to get Trump to encourage the mob to leave the Capitol on Jan. 6.""Can he make a statement, ask people to leave the Capitol?"" Hannity texted Meadows, Cheney read.But in an interview with Trump in late November, the Fox News host defended Trump's actions that day and also attacked the Jan. 6 committee.""It seems to me that the committee has a pre-determined conclusion, outcome,"" Hannity told Trump. ""And that is to once again try to bludgeon you.""On Dec. 7, Meadows appeared on Hannity, and the two men again defended Trump's actions. Neither mentioned that in private Hannity had urged for the then-president to act.""This is the same Donald Trump that said, 'Many of you will peacefully and patriotically march to the Capitol so your voices may be heard,'' Hannity said.On Tuesday, Hannity said on his show he was going to address the comments made by Cheney, then spent several minutes decrying 2020 protests against racial injustice that turned violent.""On Capitol Hill, there's no committee, there's no commission for any of these victims,"" he said. ""There's no investigation at all into the 574 riots that your media mob described as mostly peaceful.""It's unclear where Hannity obtained the number of what he referred to as ""riots,"" but, according to one report published in September 2020 looking at Black Lives Matter protests by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, more than 90% of demonstrations against police violence at the time were found to have been peaceful. Advertisement     ""All riots are obviously bad, all of them,"" Hannity said Tuesday. ""On this program we strongly condemned the violence on Jan. 6, just like we condemned all the riots from 2020.""According to transcripts from the show provided by Fox News, Hannity did not mention the texts he privately sent Meadows during the segment.

335,"In the pandemic's early days, the CDC sent thousands of faulty tests to labs nationwide, hoping to quickly catch the first US cases of COVID-19. ","


In late February 2020, nine lab officials at the CDC gathered around a whiteboard to show an FDA expert how they had made the nation’s first coronavirus test — and to try to figure out why it failed.Earlier that month, the CDC had sent thousands of faulty tests to 48 public health labs nationwide, hoping to quickly catch the first cases of COVID-19 in the US. Instead, the country succumbed to an uncontrolled spread of the new virus, without tests ready to track the outbreak. It was the opening failure of the US government's botched pandemic response, which had atrocious consequences: Hundreds of thousands of people died, millions suffered, businesses shuttered, and worthless hyperpolarized information filled the void.Scribbled on the whiteboard that February day was the layout of the tiny CDC lab faced with the monumental task of making the country’s first coronavirus test. Officials mapped where experiments were conducted and where people were flowing in and out. With the FDA expert looking on, some reached a damning conclusion: The lab was the perfect stage for contaminating the tests. Advertisement  “Everyone had a lightbulb going off, that this is really bad,” Department of Health and Human Services lawyers wrote in an investigation completed in June 2020 and obtained by BuzzFeed News through a public records request. The cache of typed and handwritten notes, the lawyers noted, were not verbatim quotes but instead the “mental impressions” from the investigators and people they interviewed.“People can come in doors and go,” one investigator wrote.“No regulation of people through the lab.”“Multiple sources [of] potential contamination.”The US Department of Health and Human Services released a three-page summary of the investigation the same month it was completed. The full investigation documents include about 50 pages of interviews conducted by two lawyers with the HHS Office of the General Counsel, stamped “Attorney-Client Privileged,” which the health agency’s public records office sent to BuzzFeed News. An HHS official later claimed the documents were “inadvertently released” and asked BuzzFeed News to delete them, calling five minutes after an agency spokesperson turned down a request to comment on the interviews.This investigation, based on the documents and interviews with health officials knowledgeable about the test’s development, reveals:Government dysfunction. Congress, CDC leadership, and past presidential administrations have neglected labs at the world’s most highly regarded public health agency for decades. The small, underfunded Respiratory Virus Diagnostic (RVD) Lab was overburdened as COVID-19 blazed across the country.Questionable blame. The initial investigation summary criticized the RVD lab for the catastrophic failure of the nation’s first COVID test. But further documents and interviews call its conclusions into question, indicating a larger lab may have been the actual culprit — something HHS investigators failed to find.Cut corners. In the CDC’s rush to develop a lab test, officials chose to assemble two of its critical parts in the same facility, leading to cross-contamination that compromised the kits sent to state and city health agencies nationwide. This type of contamination happened before, during the 2012 MERS outbreak.Overconfidence. The CDC did not initially rely on tests already in use in other countries, because officials thought they could build a better one. Agency leaders did not coordinate with outside manufacturers for support, and they never performed any validations of previously developed tests that could have been used as backup.Systemic failures. The documents also reveal something even more damning: that the failures extended far beyond any one lab. The test’s problems, the documents show, are a symptom of much bigger mistakes — still unexamined — starting with the Trump administration's lack of a pandemic plan, lack of leadership and coordination at federal public health agencies, and widespread medical misjudgment in the early days of the pandemic that left the CDC holding the bag for everyone else’s failures.The test catastrophe documented by the HHS investigation has led to unprecedented demands from former federal science officials to overhaul the CDC in order to avert another such disaster. This is a move that would essentially transform the country’s public health system. There are even calls to take pandemic testing responsibilities away from the CDC: the Biden administration proposed a $65 billion (already scaled down to roughly $10 billion in public health spending in the “Build Back Better” bill) “mission control” office to handle future pandemics. And Harold Varmus, the Nobel Prize winner and former director of the National Institutes of Health, and John Holdren, a science adviser to the Obama administration, recently called for a “COVID-19 Commission,” similar to the 9/11 Commission, to investigate the US’s blunders during the pandemic. They want to start by investigating the CDC's COVID-19 test failure.The former director of the CDC, Tom Frieden, who reviewed the full investigation documents at BuzzFeed News’ request, said he was “kind of stunned” by the test failure. Under his tenure, in 2009, CDC rapidly developed a very successful test for the H1N1 flu pandemic, sending millions of test kits worldwide.“The fact is CDC has phenomenal laboratories, and they’re a treasure for the US and for the world,” Frieden said, “but they clearly need to up their game.”The investigation documents show that “now is the right time to ask broader questions about the future of the CDC,” said Scott Becker, chief executive officer of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, the group that alerted the CDC to the test’s problems last year.Benjamin Haynes, a spokesperson for the CDC, defended the agency in a statement to BuzzFeed News: “Since the rollout of the initial COVID-19 test, CDC has implemented corrective measures and remains dedicated to the highest quality laboratory science and safety.” The US Food and Drug Administration and HHS — the FDA and CDC’s parent organization — declined to comment on the record.As experts look to the CDC’s future, there’s much to learn from the past — especially from the early days of the pandemic, when a series of decisions at a tiny lab in Atlanta, strapped for funds and left to take on a Herculean task, would set the course for a global pandemic to hobble a global superpower.
 


December 30, 2019Warnings about the coronavirus spread worldwide when the ProMED alert system, an email service to identify emerging infectious disease threats, issued an initial report that described four people in China who had developed a “pneumonia of unknown cause.”The detection of a potentially novel virus sent health agencies worldwide scrambling to develop a test to identify infected people and stop its spread. The World Health Organization and South Korean firms quickly began designing one.In the US, the responsibility for developing a test fell to the CDC. The agency’s headquarters, a gated and secure facility, boasted one of the four highest biosafety-level laboratories in the US and about a dozen other buildings filled with labs, technicians, and scientists. The team tasked with developing the nation’s first test was in the tiny RVD lab, which included four smaller procedure rooms, all located on the seventh floor of Building 18 at the CDC headquarters. In January 2020, the RVD lab was staffed by nine people — only three of whom were full-time employees.
 


By Jan. 6, 2020, one of those full-time staffers, Xiaoyan Lu, an 18-year veteran microbiologist at the lab, was already discussing the design for a test with her boss and lab chief, Stephen Lindstrom. Three days later, a virus genome released by a consortium of Chinese scientists confirmed the unknown pneumonia was caused by a coronavirus, Lu’s specialty. Neither Lu nor Lindstrom would speak to BuzzFeed News on the record about the events described in this article or about their interviews with investigators.In the interview notes from the HHS investigation, however, Lindstrom described the development time for a CDC test as a “short fuse.” His supervisor, he said, ordered him to get FDA emergency authorization “as quickly as possible” so the test could be put to use.So Lu began to quickly design a test from scratch. To do so, she identified three key regions of the virus genome that it could catch. Two of these regions — called N1 and N2 — were specific to the new virus. The third stretch of genes, N3, was found in all SARS-like coronaviruses. The N3 piece was chosen partly because the team had to design the test before they actually had the genome for the new coronavirus in hand, and partly as a way to keep the test effective if the virus mutated rapidly, according to Lindstrom’s notes. Advertisement  On Jan. 10, the lab ordered large batches of chemicals to detect these three stretches of the virus’s genome in tested samples. These chemicals, or “reagents,” came from a much larger “core” lab at the CDC that manufactures compounds on demand for its more than 200 laboratories.Lindstrom’s lab got batches of the three reagents — matched to N1, N2, and N3 — on Monday, Jan. 13.But then there was a hang-up, according to Lu’s notes, with a vital fourth part of the test known as positive controls. These are copies of the part of the virus’s genes keyed to the three reagents. Every lab that gets a new test has to immediately mix the reagents with positive controls to prove that the tests can detect the virus. The copies of the virus's genes should link up with the reagents and always lead to a positive test result.Likewise, to prove that the test doesn’t cause false positives, labs hold a separate trial of the reagents mixed with distilled water. With no virus segments in that sample, that test should always yield a negative result. Advertisement  Test manufacturers usually don’t add positive controls to test kits until the final step before shipping, when everything else is freeze-dried or sealed away. That’s to avoid molecules of these viral gene bits sneaking into the reagents and contaminating them, which would cause false positives. It’s such a crucial step that some labs even manufacture positive controls at a separate site to make sure no such contamination can occur.At the respiratory virus lab, employees felt they didn’t have this luxury, according to Lu’s notes. They needed their positive controls to check their test worked — but Lu couldn’t get them from a commercial manufacturer for another 10 days. “Can I wait a week or 10 days? No, I can’t, we need this,” the notes from Lu’s interview read. The first possible US cases were likely already spreading from China, with the Chinese New Year holiday travel in full swing.So she asked the core lab to go ahead and make the positive controls along with the reagents. “We couldn’t get it anywhere else,” Lu’s interview notes say. And Lindstrom, according to her interview, told Lu he didn’t think that contamination would be a problem. But notes from Lindstrom’s interview disagree at this point, saying he only approved of the core lab making these early positive controls if that lab’s director were certain they could do it safely. People with knowledge of this conversation deny that Lindstrom had said he had no concerns about contamination.Because the core lab personnel knew of the contamination risk, they made the positive controls on separate machines and in separate workspaces. Each set of these early January positive control genes were made to match the test reagents — and they contained subtle, signature differences from the genes of the “wild” virus loose in the world. They delivered them to the respiratory virus lab the afternoon after Lu’s request, at 12:51 p.m. Eastern time on Jan. 14. Advertisement  
 


On Jan. 16, the World Health Organization published instructions from the German Center for Infection Research for its successful COVID test. Dozens of countries worldwide began to widely manufacture and distribute it.Why didn’t the CDC team follow suit? Lu, according to the interview notes, said that the health agency scientists thought they could make a better one. The CDC’s test mimicked the one it had made for MERS in 2012. “Our MERS assay performed better than WHO’s,” Lu recounted. And, she added, “We were racing against the clock.”But she also knew how crucial the positive control manufacturing step was, according to her interview. CDC’s test for MERS, while ultimately successful, was initially contaminated after the lab made the same risky choice: to manufacture the reagents and controls in the same location.A CDC employee familiar with the development of the test told BuzzFeed News that the health agency had also felt it would be better to have both US and German types of tests available worldwide — and that copying the WHO test would not have been politically possible under Donald Trump. “Imagine the backlash we would have had if CDC had said, ‘Hey, yeah, let’s use a German test,’” the CDC employee said.
 


January 17, 2020The director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Nancy Messonnier, held the agency’s first public briefing on the novel coronavirus. At the time, there had been just two known deaths worldwide and fewer than 50 cases, mostly in China. The majority of the cases, she said, were thought to be due to human contact with infected animals. “Based on the information that CDC has today, we believe the current risk from this virus to the general public is low,” Messonnier said.Nevertheless, the CDC was preparing for the worst by designing a national test for the virus. “We'll be distributing this test to state health departments,” she said.By Jan. 18, the RVD lab had a diagnostic test for the novel coronavirus up and running.But to manufacture and run all the tests, Lindstrom’s lab needed help. On Jan. 20, Messonnier “activated” its Emergency Operations Center at CDC to respond to the crisis and put a task force of senior officials in charge of the test kit’s manufacture. This sidelined RVD lab supervisors with coronavirus and respiratory disease expertise and replaced them with ones who had experience in flu and Zika virus outbreaks, the last large-scale global pandemics. Dozens of technicians borrowed from other CDC labs moved into the small RVD lab. For the first two weeks of developing the test, everyone in the RVD lab was in very close quarters before more space was opened up.According to his interview with the HHS investigators, Lindstrom had “moved over to respiratory viruses to have [a] quieter life.” He had previously managed the much larger test development team at the CDC flu lab, the one that produced the H1N1 test in 2009 in record time. Now, he was trying to recapitulate that success in a smaller lab with a much smaller team. Advertisement  Before January 2020, the budget for coronavirus preparedness was approximately $300,000, roughly 1/100th of the CDC budget for flu pandemic preparedness. Every year, the flu lab designs, leads, and organizes more than 1 million tests performed in public health labs nationwide. It analyzes the full genetic sequences of more than 7,000 flu samples, in support of a flu vaccination campaign; in the 2019 season, more than half the US population was inoculated.
 


The RVD lab was underfunded despite two recent coronavirus outbreaks, SARS and MERS, that killed hundreds of people and triggered worldwide alarm. Despite decades of pandemic preparations and planning by US government officials, the CDC had kept coronavirus testing contained in this one small lab, which was also dedicated to childhood respiratory diseases and colds. One of its neighbors, the gastrointestinal diseases lab, actually had more rooms. The RVD lab initially borrowed one small procedure room from that group to handle specimens early on in the pandemic. It was later taken back. Advertisement  “Steve didn’t have what he had in the flu [lab]: a system of people with knowledge, resources, staff appropriate for all stages of manufacturing qualifying design, while also doing diagnostic testing,” the investigator’s notes from Lindstrom’s interview said. Five or fewer people at the CDC were the only ones doing this for the novel coronavirus test. “Flu is very well funded, but ‘we’ are poorly funded,” Lu’s interview notes read.On Jan. 21 Messonnier announced that the first case of someone infected with the coronavirus had been discovered in the US. He was an American who had traveled in China and had alerted his doctor about his symptoms, which developed shortly after he returned home to Washington state. His doctor notified state health officials, who shipped the man’s nasal swab overnight to the CDC. Lindstrom’s lab tested it and notified them about the positive result the next day.“Right now, testing for this virus must take place at CDC, but in the coming weeks, we anticipate sharing these tests with domestic and international partners,” Messonnier added. By then it was clear the virus could be transmitted person-to-person. Advertisement  With his cobbled-together team now running diagnostic tests, Lindstrom needed to get the FDA’s emergency use authorization (EUA) in order to ship test kits to public health labs nationwide. Getting the EUA was a big hurdle, albeit significantly slimmed down from normal approval procedures. It required the core lab to send over the reagents for 600 test kits, while the CDC team double-checked that the test worked, according to the interview notes.
 


People worked nights and weekends, turning out 5 to 10 times more batches of reagents than normal at the core lab, according to the investigation notes. After two weeks, Lindstrom’s lab took over making positive controls, no longer needing the core lab’s early January positive control templates to prove the test worked.The CDC test was intended only as a tool for the public health agency to detect outbreaks, not to diagnose every sick person walking into an emergency room. Instead, in the early days of the pandemic, it became the only legal US test for every patient.That’s in part because no one else stepped up: Large test makers, burned before by past demands for unused and unsold Ebola and Zika virus tests, had no incentive to start making tests. And smaller academic and medical center labs were daunted by the paperwork requirements to validate tests: 240 pages’ worth of patient testing data. Underlying all this hesitancy was a widely held feeling that because earlier coronavirus outbreaks had not led to pandemics, this new coronavirus would also be limited. At that time, coronaviruses were considered deadly but not terrifically infectious, as a rule.The FDA EUA for distributing the test kits came amid the dawning realization at the end of January that the new coronavirus might spread without symptoms. By the time the CDC got the green light from the FDA on Feb. 4 to send out the test kits, China had reported more than 23,000 COVID-19 cases and over 400 deaths. By then, the city of Hong Kong was running 700 to 800 tests a day. The US had only reported 15 tests total, according to the Covid Tracking Project.
 


February 4, 2020Because there was such a short supply of tests, the CDC’s guidelines in February limited testing to travelers from China with symptoms, such as a cough or fever. These criteria were cooked up in January, when the coronavirus was still considered contagious only when people had symptoms and when the virus was not known to yet be in the US — both mistakes. That meant the CDC test newly authorized by the FDA was aimed at too small a pool of people to actually spot an outbreak.“We got the EUA 2/4,” Lindstrom said in his interview. “Shortly after released 400 kits for distribution.”Each kit contained enough tests for 800 people. Two days later, the test kits arrived at 48 public health labs nationwide. Before they could use the tests, the labs had to use the kit materials to verify that the tests actually worked. That required testing the reagents against both the positive controls (to see if that combination reliably produced a positive result) and against distilled water (to see if they produced a negative one).By the end of the week, Lindstrom’s lab got the numbers back. What they saw was alarming.“N3 failed to verify in 36 of 48 labs that tried,” his interview notes said. The water test was producing false positives 75% of the time. A few labs, notably labs in New York, also reported problems with the N1 reagent.The only tool the country had to spot and stop a COVID-19 outbreak didn’t work.
 


The CDC halted shipping of the tests over the weekend. The following Monday, Feb. 10, the agency held an emergency meeting among the three labs responsible for making the kits: the core lab, which manufactured the reagents, the RVD lab, which made full-gene positive controls and checked and assembled the reagents, and the Division of Scientific Resources lab, which packed everything together into test kits for shipping.The “working hypothesis” was that the core lab had been contaminated by producing both the reagents and the early January positive controls, requiring a “deep clean,” the interview with the core lab’s branch chief, Jan Pohl, said. Pohl did not respond to BuzzFeed News’ offer to him to review the interview notes.
 


Meanwhile, the CDC’s screwup was becoming one of the biggest news stories in the US, sparking widespread panic over the lack of tests. By this point, South Korea was conducting 15,000 tests a day. China’s labs had started distributing test kits almost a month earlier.At a Feb. 12 press briefing, Messonnier was peppered with questions about the troubled tests. “During a response like this, we know things may not always go as smoothly as we would like,” she said. “Of course, I hoped that this week every state — and every state did receive a kit — every state would be up and running.”By the end of the week, only nine state or city labs could verify that the tests worked and start running them. New York state, which would soon be the site of a deadly surge in New Rochelle, was not among them.A “deep clean” of two core lab rooms happened over the Presidents Day weekend, on Feb. 16 and 17 — a painstaking process where engineers take equipment apart and individually sterilize parts before reassembling them. ”It was important for our purification,” the interview notes read. Advertisement     
 


February 21, 2020Days after the deep clean, FDA microbiologist Timothy Stenzel was ordered to fly to Atlanta to determine why the test was failing. He landed on Saturday afternoon and drove straight to the CDC’s headquarters — where he couldn’t get past security guards at the biosecure campus because it was a weekend. Advertisement     His complaints were fielded all the way up to CDC Director Robert Redfield. Stenzel was finally let in for a tour of the RVD lab on Sunday. Over the next three days, he toured the other labs, later complaining of “vague answers” to his questions. “No one person could walk Tim through the whole process and tell him what was done,” despite the task force of senior CDC officials supposedly being in charge, Stenzel said, according to the interview notes. The notes said that at a commercial facility, versus a public health lab, “there would have been an operational lead” overseeing the process. Stenzel declined a request to speak on the record.In those interviews, however, Stenzel reported the core lab and distribution lab appeared very clean, but the respiratory virus lab appeared “messy,” more like a research lab than a medical one — which, in fairness, is what it was. At the end of the visit, on Feb. 25, Stenzel gathered members of the three labs together to talk through what went wrong with the test. Several people pointed to the respiratory virus lab as the possible culprit, suggesting that specimens sent there early in the test’s development were contaminating the reagents.Lindstrom was in the “hot seat” at the meeting, according to an investigator interview with CDC Division of Scientific Resources quality manager Heather Hughes. In a phone call, Hughes told BuzzFeed News she had been told not to speak to reporters by the CDC’s press office. Advertisement     As Lindstrom described the respiratory lab’s workflow on a whiteboard, the “lightbulb” moment came, according to Stenzel: The RVD lab had handled virus samples and positive controls in its main room. That may have contaminated the N1 and N3 reagents handled in nearby smaller rooms as lab personnel moved around.Normally, in order to prevent this kind of contamination, technicians handling samples need to be separated from those doing quality control on tests. Foot traffic should be one way only to prevent people from accidentally contaminating each other by contact or through the air. Under pressure and with limited space, that wasn’t happening at Lindstrom’s lab, according to Stenzel’s interview notes. Contamination under these conditions could have fouled both the N3 and N1 reagents.Every point of this scenario — from the viral samples being opened in a common area to people tramping from contaminated areas into clean procedure rooms — is disputed by three CDC personnel familiar with the test’s development who were interviewed by BuzzFeed News. They asked not to be named, citing fear of professional retaliation by CDC.While the core lab facilities were being cleaned and government officials were debating the source of the contamination, things were moving fast in the outside world: By the end of his visit on Feb. 25, Stenzel urged CDC leaders to move manufacturing of the coronavirus test kits out of their labs and over to a private manufacturer, according to his interview. The agency would make this move a week later. Advertisement     In a CDC briefing on that same day, Messonnier jolted the nation by warning that — with 2,700 COVID-19 deaths already being reported worldwide — outbreaks would inevitably shut down work and schools in the US.Facing what was now looking like an inescapable pandemic, the CDC’s unreliable three-part test was scrapped. On Feb. 26, the agency gave public health labs permission to nix the contaminated N3 component from tests they had already received, and it began sending out kits with only N1 and N2. The N1 reagents were no longer throwing off false positives by this point.
 


Other medical centers and academic labs across the country had also begun developing their own coronavirus tests, many looking for the N1 and N2 components like the CDC test. They had been clamoring for permission to run their own tests to speed results to doctors and meet surging demands.On Feb. 29, the FDA finally gave them permission to use their own tests. “We should have been permitted to do testing in January,” said Geoffrey Baird, a laboratory medicine expert at the University of Washington who reviewed the investigation notes for BuzzFeed News. “We weren’t. We were waiting and had this laboratory-developed test ready, like everyone else who knew anything about this, the week after the Chinese published the sequence.”That same day, Washington state officials reported the first suspected US death from COVID-19, a man in his 50s who had gone untested because he did not meet the CDC’s travel-based screening guidelines for the virus. They also reported the first large outbreak, diagnosed by non-CDC tests, at the Life Care Center nursing home of Kirkland, Washington. Ultimately, at least 43 residents died.“CDC should not be in the business of manufacturing test kits,” Baird said. The RVD lab team shouldn’t have been put in that precarious position in the first place, he added. “There should be a major test manufacturing company on standby.”The Kirkland deaths, coming just as the failure of the CDC test became clear to the public, spurred the Trump administration’s politicized response to the coronavirus.
 


Trump visited the CDC on March 6. Just a few hours before he’d arrived, the HHS investigators ended their three days of interviews with lab personnel. But with the cameras rolling at CDC, Trump falsely promised that “anybody that wants a test can get a test.”In reality, only about 2,000 tests were performed on that date. Meanwhile, the country fell into uncontrolled spread of the virus.AftermathEven before the investigation summary was made public, the botched tests cast a shadow over the CDC. By late spring of this year, Messonnier had retired from the health agency, and Lindstrom and other lab officials involved in the test’s rollout had moved into other positions. Messonnier, who now works at the Skoll Foundation, did not respond to a request to review and comment on the interview notes.On June 19, a summary report was publicly released concluding that the N3 component of the CDC test was likely contaminated at the RVD lab. “Time pressure” likely played a role, the brief said. The report did not delve into deeper questions of why the lab was so small to start with, why it was counted on to run diagnostic tests for the whole country in a burgeoning pandemic, or why other tests weren’t available when it failed. Advertisement     But an email that a lab official sent to CDC leadership just three days later called into question the central conclusion that the respiratory virus lab was to blame.The email, reviewed by BuzzFeed News, stated that the report contained false statements and that HHS investigators had received genetic test results showing that the real source of the contamination was the core lab positive controls — revealed by their distinct genetic signature. In this view, the “deep cleaning” of two core lab rooms washed the contamination out of the manufacturing process. That’s why the N1 region that had failed validation at some state public health labs ran clean enough to go back into tests by the end of the month.The investigation interviews mention that the polio lab at the CDC was running a genetic analysis of the contamination that briefly fouled up N1 reagents in March 2020. That contamination does not match the cloned coronavirus gene made by the RVD lab to serve as positive controls, BuzzFeed News learned from an internal email sent later by a CDC lab official. This is significant evidence to suggest the RVD lab wasn’t the source of the contamination — despite HHS saying it was.HHS and the CDC did not comment on the email or the allegation that the contamination may have involved the core lab. A CDC “root cause” analysis reported last year by NPR blamed the test’s failures on the RVD lab missing quality checks on kits sent out in February. A report on the test kits, led by the Division of Scientific Resources, is slotted for a scientific journal later this month. It will suggest that the N3 reagent may have suffered from a design failure rather than from contamination, according to a lab official. That’s despite its successful use in FDA-authorized tests by major commercial companies for the rest of the pandemic. Advertisement     In the aftermath of the test failure, and a critical Government Accountability Office report, the CDC has announced a series of “Lab Quality Improvement Activities,” requiring extra labs to validate tests inside and outside the agency before their release. The agency plans to ask the FDA to withdraw the initial test’s authorization at the end of the year and require all lab personnel to pass new accreditation exams by 2024.The CDC still hasn’t officially released its own explanation for what went wrong. A separate report from the HHS inspector general started in April 2020 but has yet to be finalized. That report, which is only looking at lab procedures at the CDC and will not determine the origin of any contamination, won’t be out until next year.The key will be making sure any changes at the CDC have lasting impacts. “A lot of money gets put in, then the emergency goes away, and people forget about it,” said Frieden, the former agency chief. “These are laboratories that need to work every day, year after year.” Advertisement     The fact that the CDC was the only group in the US responsible for making tests made the failure even more consequential, Baird said. But he argued that the wider lack of tests wasn’t the CDC’s fault. Instead, he blamed the FDA, which held on to a bureaucratic EUA process that stymied fast action in the face of a public health emergency. “There was a feeling this wasn’t going to be a major outbreak early on,” a CDC lab official told BuzzFeed News, saying that senior leaders didn’t do enough to encourage industrial test manufacturers to mobilize.An FDA official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, told BuzzFeed News that criticism of its EUA process is misplaced because the alternative would have been throwing the US’s doors open to a blizzard of shoddy tests in that first February of the pandemic. That would have showered doctors nationwide with false positive and negative test results in February 2020.Overall, the test problems were just a small part of the absence of a national strategy for dealing with a pandemic, the FDA official added. A plan for nationwide testing capability, for example, was launched at the start of the pandemic and “scrapped” by the Trump administration, former FDA chief Scott Gottlieb writes in his recent book, Uncontrolled Spread: Why COVID-19 Crushed Us and How We Can Defeat the Next Pandemic. Instead, the administration had no plan aside from sending testing supplies to states and pressuring the FDA to authorize more tests after the CDC test failed. Advertisement     The CDC’s test failure is a symptom of this wider pandemic failure across the entire government. There weren’t enough tests, but there also weren’t enough ventilators or personal protective equipment or swabs available nationwide.In the aftermath, the country is left with the question of how to make sure there isn’t a similar failure in the next pandemic. Many experts are suggesting the CDC – once considered the global ideal – either needs major changes or should play a significantly smaller role.“There is no other institution in the world that does as wide a variety of laboratory tests as CDC. And it does them under very difficult conditions, where you have huge time pressure, you have uncertainties,” Frieden said. “The fact that a problem like this could occur clearly indicates that you need additional structural reforms at CDC.”If the Biden administration’s plan to create a central pandemic office comes to fruition, the place to locate it is probably not the CDC, “where functions are bunkered inside rigid siloes,” Gottlieb writes in his book. “Going forward, we need to provide for a national-level capability to field and deploy clinical tests for a novel pathogen.” ● Advertisement

336,Chicago photographer Jeffrey Wolin has spent the last several years talking with and documenting the circumstances of people who experience homelessness.,"


The problem of unaffordable housing — and the inextricable problem of people experiencing homelessness — is so obvious in major cities, including New York, where I live, that it can be overwhelming. For some, that feeling can be translated into a sense of learned blindness — If I don't look too hard, it is not a problem, and certainly not my problem.Jeffrey Wolin, a photographer in Chicago and professor emeritus at Indiana University, has taken the opposite approach. He has spent the last several years talking with and documenting the circumstances of people who are homeless. He works with advocacy organizations, including the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, to find participants. His approach is collaborative, showing people in a place of their choice, with a text telling their story in their own words. The overall effect allows for more dignity and compassion for all parties involved. His photos have been turned into a book, Faces of Homelessness, and are now on exhibition in Chicago. We spoke with Wolin about his work, and about some of the ethics involved in working with this community. Advertisement  
 


Can you talk about how you approached this project?When I moved to Chicago, the homelessness in a big city is in your face every day. So it was like, what is this crisis? How do we fix it? Advertisement  [My] first impulse says, well, I'll grab my camera and I'll just walk down the street and I'll take pictures of homeless people, but then it's like, well, do I give them money or do I pay them? Are they telling you the truth? I decided that the best thing I could do was work with professional agencies that advocate for the homeless and really understand the problems of homelessness, rather than just, you know, poke my way into people's private lives.
 


With my portraits, I started working with the leader group [of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless], which includes people who have been homeless but are no longer homeless. One of the first things I learned was that the people we see on the streets, some of whom are clearly in need of medication, they're not the majority of homeless people. They're the most visible and stereotypical parts of the problem. To fix their problems is different than fixing the problems of the vast majority of homeless people, who are invisible, living doubled up with their families or their friends. They're living in shelters; they're living in a whole variety of situations.The solution to that homelessness is very different. They need housing. It's a lot of women who've left abusive relationships. They need childcare so they can work. Or they need job training. They need legal help. There are kids coming out as gay — when they're growing up at home and their parents kicked them out of the house. What happens to them? People who lost their job and didn't have a financial backup or a family that could take care of them. Advertisement  So not everyone has drug addictions or mental illness. Not at all. But that's what we think of.Everyone needs food and shelter. That's just basic human needs. If people are homeless for less than a year, they have a much better chance of reintegrating fully into society. Whereas the longer it goes on, the harder it is to break out of the situation. So it's really important to get people the care they need when they need it rather than it becoming a chronic situation.There are 16,000 kids in Chicago who are technically homeless in that they have no permanent address. They're not on the street; they're living with a grandma or an auntie or friends, and that's how they're getting through. But try getting up and taking your SATs when you don't have a home.There's one woman in the book, her name is Maxica, who had a good job, she had three kids, and she had saved up enough money to buy a house. She was about to buy the house and then discovered that she had breast cancer. By the time they discovered it, she had to have radical surgery, mastectomy, chemo, and she didn't have good insurance. It ate all her life savings, and she and the kids were on the street. They wound up in a shelter and were homeless for almost nine months. Advertisement  Now she has her own apartment. She has her master's degree in business. Because we are the sort of country without a terribly good safety net, it's not hard for anyone to wind up homeless.
 


What are your interactions with the people you're photographing?I work with people who are pretty well vetted, so I know that they're not gonna make stuff up. I made up a questionnaire, sent [it to] them, and then asked where they wanted to meet.The questionnaire focused on: How did you become homeless? What's your day-to-day like? Where do you sleep? How do you think we could solve the problem of homelessness?Questions that get them to focus on their experiences. I take notes and then I read the notes back to them. When their story is compiled, I send it to them for their approval.I'm still in touch with almost all of the people that I have photographed for this project, but there are some people who've just disappeared, their phone number no longer works. They're not doing email; the organizations have lost touch with them. In the cases where I still have contact with them, I send them the portrait and their narratives in case they want to change anything. Hopefully by the end of the year, everyone will get a copy of the book and everyone gets a big print of their portrait.What are some of the ethics that you've considered working with a population that's a little bit more vulnerable and very often not treated respectfully by people with cameras? Advertisement  When I was at the George Eastman Museum running the darkrooms, we had [documentary photographer] Lewis Hine's negatives. It gave me a deeper understanding of his work and his humanity and the way he approached vulnerable populations — child labor, recent immigrants. All that is timely again, unfortunately. I became close with Walter Rosenblum, who was a protégé of Lewis Hine in the Photo League, and a well-known photographer in his own right.I learned from these masters of photography that people matter and that you don't take advantage of people. You don't mislead them. It's this tradition of humanistic photography, working with people who otherwise tend to be invisible and making them visible, but on their terms. With these shows and these books, people will be able to look in that way to communicate directly with them. I use their own words. I don't rewrite the stories.I make sure that I do everything I can to avoid the criticism that I'm taking advantage of people that I'm trying to help.What are things that you hope the viewer will get out of this project?I've grappled with that question, and I don't have a perfect answer. Basically, what I want first of all is just education. And then that [people] look at the portraits and are compelled to read the stories and connect with the human, one to one. Here's a face, here's their story. And to have some empathy for these individuals. Advertisement  I would like people to realize that the problem is not as simple as what they're seeing on the streets, that most homeless are invisible.

Fiction
 


That So died so young and suddenly certainly adds to the eerie sense of promise and potential in his posthumous debut collection, but rest assured, So knew he was going to be a star and this collection proves it. From the first story about two sisters working at a donut shop and speculating on the customer who comes in late at night to a virtuosic screenplay rendering of a family wedding with secrets unearthed to the gut-wrenching final story based on So’s mother’s family history — the writing is electric and original. —Tomi Obaro
 


Those familiar with Rooney’s last two books, Normal People and Conversations with Friends — both since adapted for the screen, and both hailed as landmarks of millennial fiction (whatever that really is) — will find more classic Rooneyisms in Beautiful World: deceptively simple sentences that are a real pleasure to read, skinny, pale, and brooding characters figuring out adulthood in modern Ireland. This time, we meet Alice, a young Irish novelist, whose long emails exchanged with best friend Eileen reflect her anxieties and ambivalences about literary fame, modern culture, impending social collapse, and the role of religion in their lives.These emails, placed interstitially as chapters throughout the novel — which is otherwise written in a distant third person — are the only times we can really get in these womens’ heads. To some readers (at least, some of the friends I’ve had feverish debriefs with after we devoured the book), the emails are self-indulgent drags; I know at least two people who skimmed them. But I found the letters, loving exchanges between friends with (in typical Rooney fashion) major class differences and positionalities, to be lovely, moving, and even profound.To the extent the book is “about” anything, both Alice and Eileen have love interests; to me, though, they’re the least interesting bits. I loved spending time in Rooney’s characters’ heads — they’re frustrating and funny, petty and loving, fallible and human. —Shannon Keating Advertisement     
 


Though Swamy’s debut novel examines the lack of agency for mothers in 1960s and '70s Bombay — her protagonist’s struggles are equally relevant today. Vidya’s young life is defined by her mother’s mental illness and eventual suicide. Vidya’s mother was deeply unhappy with motherhood and the ways in which society controls women’s actions. After her mother’s death, Vidya vows never to have children and to devote herself to Kathak dancing instead. Dance feels like breathing for Vidya, but when she becomes pregnant later in the novel, she struggles with how to balance her art with motherhood. Swamy’s immersive and vivid writing comes across beautifully in Sneha Mathan’s narration of the audiobook. —Margaret Kingsbury Advertisement     
 


This novel follows a 9-year-old Syrian boy, Amir, who has washed up as the sole survivor of a refugee boat that sank near a small island. He’s rescued by Vӓnna, a local teenage girl, who seems to feel her own kind of displacement even at home. The chapters alternate between Amir’s life before getting to the island and the journey he and Vӓnna take toward safety. In a little more than 250 pages, El Akkad manages to write a book about family, masculinity, migration, language, humanity (or a lack thereof), and innocence. Every word feels essential, and every chapter is quietly devastating until you reach the novel’s conclusion, a chapter that I’m confident every reader will remember for the rest of their lives. The story is brutal but compassionate, one that humanizes migrants so often stripped of their humanity as soon as they become “migrants.” Advertisement     El Akkad is infuriating because his prose is perfect, and his characters are more vivid than some people I know in real life. It’s devastating and, at times, hopeful, and even when his characters act without compassion, El Akkad always rights the ship back toward tenderness. What Strange Paradise cements El Akkad as one of the best writers alive today: clairvoyant, heartbreaking, and exceptional. —Scaachi Koul
 


Although it’s been classified as historical fiction, when it comes down to the heart and soul of this beautifully written debut novel by Robert Jones Jr., it's a love story at its core. Jones explores the forbidden romance between two enslaved boys — Isaiah and Samuel — in the Deep South, who find solace and safety in one another, despite their circumstances and the negative forces trying to tear them apart. Darkness becomes their best friend — the only time when they feel secure enough to strip away from their reality and come together as one. Told from multiple perspectives, Jones seamlessly intertwines names and themes from the Bible with the merciless treatment of enslaved people to bring readers a story that’s equally uncomfortable as it is alluring. The multiple narratives can feel a little overwhelming at first, but it quickly becomes clear how these vivid characters and their various perspectives illuminate this tale. I appreciate how honest Jones is with his writing, because even during those graphic moments where I would’ve preferred to shield my eyes from the atrocities Isaiah and Samuel were subjected to, I ultimately knew how important it was for these truths to be told. It’s a powerful telling of a resilient love that will leave you starving for more. —Morgan Murrell Advertisement     
 


I nearly didn’t finish this book. Not because I found fault with the writing — Lockwood is a brilliant, hilarious, and truly original writer. But in mid-2021, when I first picked it up, I was interested in escaping the increasingly dystopian internet landscape, and I wasn’t sure if a fictionalized account of a woman achieving social media fame in something deemed “the portal” would offer me the kind of escapism I craved. Indeed, in the first half of the book, Lockwood’s narrator sinks further into the portal’s bizarro world of endless jokes and strange images as a dictator takes over and climate collapse looms. A little too on the nose for me! Advertisement     But just when I was about to set the book aside, something changed. The narrator receives two texts from her mother, asking her to come home — something has gone wrong with her sister’s pregnancy.What unfolds throughout the rest of the novel is nothing short of astonishing. Lockwood has fictionalized a true tragedy from her own family’s life, and the way she imbues her irony-pilled narrator with an ever-greater knowledge of what is good and right in true in an increasingly dark and chaotic world frequently brought me to tears. I’ve never read anything like it. —Shannon Keating
 


The poignant and poetic vignettes that comprise Somebody Loves You are at first startling in their interplay between fantasy and reality, but while Ruby’s child perspective may lend itself to the whimsical at times — and especially in the beginning — her narrative is steeped in the reality and traumas of life as a South Asian girl in England. When Ruby begins elementary school, she chooses to become silent, observing the world instead of letting her voice impact it. In Ruby’s small day-to-day observances, the reader sees a mother’s mental illness unfold, the devastating impact of a neighbor’s racism, and the fraught bond between sisters unravel and weave back together again. Lovely, funny, and heartbreaking, this liminal glimpse into a child’s life is unforgettable. —M.K. Advertisement     
 


In what might be a queasy premise in the hands of a less capable writer, Peters tackles the bogeyman of detransitioning and queer parenting in this thoughtful novel about an unconventional trio. Reese is a trans woman in her mid-30s who wants to become a mother and is feeling somewhat rudderless in a series of dead-end jobs with dead-end boyfriends. Ames, formerly known as Amy before he detransitioned, has just gotten his boss, Katrina pregnant. He reaches out to Reese, whom he dated before he detransitioned, to see if she might be interested in coparenting. It’s a premise that feels a little unbelievable, but it’s really a way for Peters to dig into the backstories of Ames and Reese, their relationships to themselves and their gender identity. Peters is so observant and shrewd about race, class, and intersectionality; she writes movingly about the ways sex can be used to disassociate. It’s a book I spent a long time thinking about after I read it. —T.O. Advertisement     
 


When an apothecary begins to secretly dispense poisons to help liberate other women who have been wronged by the men in their lives, things take a turn for the worse — that was the short synopsis I read about this book before officially diving in and it had me hooked! Once I actually cracked it open, it didn’t take long for me to become completely enthralled. Penner takes readers on an unforgettable adventure, traveling through time between the dark alleys of 18th-century London with Nella and her hidden apothecary shop to modern-day London with aspiring historian Caroline, who stumbles upon one of Nella’s old vials. While the story initially presents itself as a murder mystery, once you peel back the layers, it quickly unfolds into a tale of women reclaiming their agency and their sense of self. It was amazing to see women protagonists learning to put themselves first, despite the people they would have to leave behind in the process. The way the author weaves together the intricate historical details, while also remaining true to the social norms of those time periods, does not go unnoticed. The writing was compelling, fun, and with just the right amount of imagination to keep me engaged from beginning to end. —M.M.
 


It seems odd to call a book delightful when it tackles such decidedly undelightful topics: the pandemic, a ghost haunting, an indigenous woman wrongfully accused of a crime and sentenced to 60 years in prison, police brutality, the entire year of 2020. Yet this novel, with its spiky yet warm main character and homage to the world of bookselling and reading, is an utterly delightful read that doesn't shy away from 2020's misery and uncertainty. Much of the novel takes place in author Louise Erdrich's bookstore, Birchbark Books. When Tookie is released from prison after a much shorter sentence than she originally received, she begins working in the bookstore. She also reunites with the man who arrested her and the two marry. Shortly before the pandemic, a frequent customer, Flora, dies and begins haunting the bookstore, particularly Tookie. Flora was the kind of white woman who longed to be indigenous and frequently invented ties to the indigenous community, although she also donated to the community. At first, her ghost is content to wander amongst the shelves, idly flipping through books, but when the pandemic hits, the ghost becomes more sinister. Sentences in multiple forms play an essential role in the novel, from prison sentences to favorite sentences from books. While the novel does meander from its ghostly plot, the bookish odes and conversations, as well as Tookie's family life, are such a joy to read that the reader will hardly mind. The novel is likely to become the book to read about the pandemic. —M.K. (From ""25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down"")
 


In 2015’s The Sympathizer, Nguyen’s Pulitzer Prize–winning debut novel, an unnamed spy documents the hypocrisies of the Vietnam War from his unique vantage point as a half-French, half-Vietnamese double agent. He’s embedded in a South Vietnamese operation based in California, while secretly working on behalf of the Communist North Vietnamese. After surviving torture in a reeducation camp, the spy sets sail for France on a refugee boat with Bon, one of his best friends and fellow South Vietnamese soldier, who doesn’t know about the spy’s Communist past.And that’s where The Committed picks up, as our unnamed protagonist joins Bon in a seedy drug-selling operation. In his spare time, he reads theorists like Fanon. Part action-packed thriller, part trenchant critique on myriad evils of imperialism, The Committed is an incisive and thought-provoking read. —T.O.
 


Mina, a physician who grew up in Beirut and is the trans daughter of a Syrian mother and Lebanese father, receives an invitation from a nurse friend to come to Lesbos to offer her medical and translation services. Her brother Mezan, the only member of her family she still speaks to, will meet her there as well.Written in short chapters and addressed to an unnamed acquaintance who, like Alameddine, is a gay Lebanese writer, Mina oscillates between her own memories: meeting her wife, Francine, her decadeslong estrangement from her family, and the stories of refugees on Lesbos. She meets a Syrian family whose wife and mother, Sumaiya, has advanced cancer and doesn’t want her children to know. Mina watches venal white volunteers ask for selfies and European journalists make racist assumptions about the people they interview. The refugee crisis has become the kind of slowly unfolding calamity that can invite a lot of overwrought trauma porn; Alameddine resists that temptation here, opting for nuanced and insightful reflections on ordinary people trapped in horrific circumstances often caused by the countries whose asylum they now seek. —T.O.

Like the best of Toews’ novels, Fight Night deals with weighty subjects — suicide, aging, illness, and mortality — with a keen sense of humor. Swiv, a spunky 9-year-old who has been suspended from school, writes letters to her absent father. The letters are mostly about her grandma, a chronically ill firecracker who loves to rile her daughter, Swiv’s mother, who is a struggling actor pregnant with a baby they’ve all dubbed Gord. When Swiv and her grandmother leave their Toronto apartment to visit relatives in Fresno, California, Swiv learns more about her family’s true fighting spirit. Like Toews herself, Swiv comes from a family of Mennonites, a minority Christian sect with strict gender roles for its dwindling populace. Her aunt and grandfather killed themselves and the shadow of that loss haunts both her grandmother and her mother, but they both cope, or fight as Swiv puts it, in different ways. As a narrator, Swiv is charming and hilarious, her grandmother even moreso. I laughed and cried reading this book; I can’t think of a higher endorsement. —T.O.

I think this is the essay collection I recommended the most this year. Miller, known primarily for his poetry, is just so smart and thoughtful and nuanced about all things, especially race and class and queerness. Experimental in form, his essays range from explorations of race and class in his native Jamaica to the surprising alienation of visiting Kenya and Senegal as a Caribbean man to the community of Black queer boys who he hangs out with in Kingston. Just a lovely, thoughtful read. —T. O.
 


An extension of the 2018 New Yorker essay of the same name, the book is part eulogy for her late mother and part love letter to Korean food and culture. Zauner (who fronts the indie-rock band Japanese Breakfast) writes with sobering clarity about her depression, her mother’s cancer diagnosis, and the food they ate together, with the titular Korean American supermarket at its core. She shares in elegant prose her experience growing up with a dual ethnicity and longing to feel at home; Oregonians, in particular, will enjoy reading about her upbringing in Eugene and her countless local references. It’s an evergreen tale of grieving, coping, and exploring the culinary palates that make up Zauner’s vibrant world. Like a home-cooked meal, this one should be savored. —Emerson Malone
 


It takes a talented writer to make a nonfiction book feel like a sweeping, multidimensional novel, but Keefe accomplishes it in his excellent Empire of Pain. Keefe, a New Yorker staff writer, follows the trail of the US opioid epidemic all the way back to the root, unraveling how one family caused massive amounts of heartache and destruction.It’s remarkable how Keefe is able to distill such a complicated story into one that really comes down to just a few people: the three Sackler brothers; one company, Purdue Pharma; and one drug, Oxycontin. In his telling, each brother is ambitious and hungry for attention and fame, but none as much as oldest brother Arthur, who Keefe paints as an almost maniacally ambitious man who set the stage for generations of his family to pursue money in the pursuit of literally anything else. Each subsequent cast of Sackler relatives, the cold and calculating Richard Sackler of the next generation, and the hypocritical and out-of-touch David Sackler of the next, shows how money and power can rot a family tree to its core. Keefe is able to so intimately describe each Sackler he profiles it almost feels like you are reading a transcript of their own inner monologues, a remarkable feat.Ultimately, this is a book about how a few misguided and greedy people can cause an outside amount of damage on the world and impact far more lives than they ever could have imagined. Isn’t that the perfect read for 2021? —Stephanie McNeal Advertisement     
 


In this memoir, Miller deftly tackles her life with Crohn’s disease while dissecting how the medical community treats people with chronic illnesses — especially women — and giving advice for those living with a chronic illness. Her writing moves from raw and sometimes grotesque bodily details to outrage at a US medical system that consistently fails the chronically ill and disabled community. Miller’s narrative is not that of a person who wants their story to be pitied. Rather, it’s an up-close glimpse into Crohn’s and the ways any body, not just Miller’s own, can revolt, and it’s a call for change in the medical community. As a reader with chronic illnesses, I found myself intensely relating to Miller’s impotent frustration at her body as well as her descriptions and advice about medical PTSD and the ways illness can trigger past traumas. —M.K.
 


When’s the last time a performance truly touched you? I mean, stopped you in your tracks, left your mouth agape, opened up your soul-type of performance? Abdurraqib, an occasional BuzzFeed News contributor, describes these euphoric instances of music and dance with such detail and elation, it almost feels like you’re listening to a friend pour their heart out about a night that changed their life. From televised dance marathons and blackface to Merry Clayton’s iconic background vocals on the Rolling Stones song “Gimme Shelter” to the Beyoncé effect, Abdurraqib not only speaks poetically of the impact these productions had on him, but also the historical and cultural significance they’ve played in society throughout the years. I found myself taking a deep dive on YouTube after every chapter, just so I could feel a slither of what he was chronicling. One of the most remarkable things about Abdurraqib’s love letter to Black performance is the unapologetic and brazen way he delivers his perspective while also dousing readers in the nuances of that same topic. And although art is subjective, he affirms just how liberating it can be.—M.M.
 


Radtke looks at the US’s unique brand of loneliness and the myriad ways we as a culture suppress it; it can weaken your immune system, make you hypervigilant, take years off your life expectancy, and perforate your reality. She considers what it means to be alone from an anthropological, biological, and pop cultural perspective; she asks what we can learn about longing and alienation from Emily Dickinson, Princess Diana, Don Draper, or Yayoi Kusama. The core American tenet of rugged cowboy individualism has unraveled into an epidemic of loneliness. The illustrations of Seek You are stunning, a complement to the sobering thought exercise in understanding one’s solitary position in the universe. —E.M.Read an excerpt here.
 


Donald Antrim’s newest memoir, One Friday in April, has stuck with me since I first read it earlier this year. With exceptional clarity and tremendous self-compassion, Antrim methodically recounts the moments that led up to committing himself to a psychiatric hospital for several months and the harrowing experience of trying to find the help he needed to bring himself back from psychosis, including treatments of ECT. It’s the clearest account of bringing oneself back from the brink of mental collapse I can remember. It’s also a masterwork of empathy. (Disclosure: Donald Antrim was my professor at Columbia University in 2009.) —Karolina Waclawiak
 


Chicago journalist Dawn Turner charts the divergent paths of three little girls — her younger sister Kim, her childhood best friend Debra, and Dawn herself — in this powerful memoir. Growing up together in a housing complex in 1970s Bronzeville, Turner is an ambitious student, while her younger sister Kim skips school and mouths off to their mother. Debra, meanwhile, is a class clown, who, as she ages, becomes more interested in partying and drugs. While Turner goes on to become an accomplished journalist, Kim, who has an alcohol addiction, dies of a heart attack at only 24, while Debra is eventually imprisoned for killing a man. How these girls — who grew up in the same building in a working-class neighborhood once famous for its Black luminaries but besieged by institutional neglect, violence, and drug addiction — had such different life experiences is the central question of this book. Turner provides no easy answers while passing no judgment. —T.O. (From “25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down”) Advertisement     
 


Albert Samaha’s Concepcion is probably the most satisfying first-gen immigrant memoir I’ve read in recent memory. As he reaches the age his mother was when she migrated to the US from the Philippines, Samaha investigates his mother’s beliefs that led her here, their family history, and whether a life in America was worth it after all. Samaha, who is half Filipino and half Lebanese, charts not just his family’s immigration story, but the story of countless others who came around that time too. Part-memoir and part-journalistic venture, Concepcion is both a time capsule about a family’s hopes and desires, as well as a history lesson for those who don’t know much about US immigration, Spanish colonialism, and the legacy of imperialism. It’s a personal story that only a reporter could write. (Full disclosure: Samaha is an editor at BuzzFeed News, and I also wrote a blurb for his book before its release.) Advertisement     The book is, at once, informative but approachable, heartbreaking but hopeful. It doesn’t matter where your family is from, where they ended up, or where you think you belong — Concepcion speaks to the inherently human desire to build something better. —Scaachi Koul (From ""25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down"")●

338,“The scary thing about growing up in the public eye is people just decide that everything you say and do and look like is who you are forever. ... I spent a lot of years pretending to be somebody that I’m not.”,"


If you didn’t know, Billie — who became associated with baggy, oversize clothes and green-rooted hair in her early years of fame — has recently branched out from her signature style, rocking more form-fitting, “feminine” looks. Though the shift has received large amounts of praise, Billie has also been called “disingenuous” and “cringy” by critics simply for experimenting with how she presents herself.
 


She continued, “But actually, no. I’m only wearing this because after the show I gotta go get married in an animé.”
 


“Would you wanna be judged by the way you presented yourself when you were 16?” she questioned. “No.”“It takes time and effort to accept who you really are,” Billie went on to add. “I spent a lot of years pretending to be somebody that I’m not.”
 


“It was so weird because I was like, 'It’s not a new style. It's one thing I wore and then I’m gonna wear this another day and then I’m gonna do this,’” she added. “Literally the thing that I’ve been preaching about since I first started is to wear what you want.""
 


“My attitude used to be, ‘Well, I can’t go out. You know, I can’t go here. I can’t go there,’” she explained, looking back on a clip of herself at age 18. “And I used to just not even be able to go to a park or go get food or get coffee.“In the last year, I have been open to it. I really feel grateful for that because being able to feel confident stepping outside without a hat and a hood and glasses and a mask and a jacket ... It’s so much better and you don't have to live like that. And I realized that this year that I don't have to live like that.“And my hair is blonde now, so it’s not, like, the only person you’ve ever seen with green hair walking by,” Billie added. She went on to switch things up again earlier this month, debuting new dark hair in an Instagram post. 
 


“I lost 100,000 followers, just because of the boobs,” Billie said of the picture. “People are scared of big boobs.”“People hold on to these memories and have an attachment,” she added. “But it's very dehumanizing.”

339,"As of Sunday, search and rescue teams were continuing to dig through rubble.","


As rescue personnel continued to search for survivors of the devastating tornadoes that tore through six states on Friday, the storms' victims are beginning to be identified.Casualties from the tornado-spawning storms have been confirmed in Kentucky, Arkansas, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee.Of all these states, Kentucky was hit the hardest. In a press conference Sunday, Gov. Andy Beshear described the destruction as the ""most devastating tornado event in our history,"" and that he believed that it will go on record as the longest path of any tornado in the US ever. The National Weather Service is still assessing the damage. Advertisement     Beshear said Saturday as many as 100 people are feared to be dead, and by Sunday, 50 deaths in his state had been confirmed. But as National Guard troops and law enforcement are continuing to search the rubble of one house to the next, he said: ""I think it’s going to be significantly worse than that. We’re still finding bodies.""Most of the victims' names have not yet been released. One of the Kentucky victims has been identified as a district judge; another as a corrections officer.In the city of Mayfield, Kentucky, which was among the hardest hit, the tornado leveled a candle factory that early reports suggested had 110 people inside during its night shift.Beshear said Sunday that 40 people had been rescued from the rubble so far, and authorities were working to confirm if others had been accounted for. However, on Sunday night, the candle factory's parent company, Mayfield Consumer Products, released a statement saying that 90 people had been located, with eight employees confirmed dead and eight others still missing.“I am praying that maybe original estimates of those we’ve lost were wrong,"" Beshear said when asked about the company's assessment. ""If so, it’s going to be pretty wonderful, but it’s pretty early.”
 


In Illinois, six people have been confirmed dead after a tornado hit an Amazon warehouse — an increase from the estimated two people in the immediate aftermath of the storm.Madison County Coroner Stephen Nonn on Sunday identified the six people who were killed to the Associated Press as 26-year-old Austin J. McEwen, 29-year-old Clayton Lynn Cope, 46-year-old Larry E. Virden, 62-year-old Kevin D. Dickey, 28-year-old Deandre S. Morrow, and 34-year-old Etheria S. Hebb.

AirPods Max — $549 at AppleLook, Apple’s AirPods Max are some expensive headphones — like months'-worth-of-groceries expensive (Apple loaned BuzzFeed a pair to review.) And let’s be honest, your current earbuds probably sound pretty great and have more daily use cases. But if you feel you need over-ear headphones, the AirPods Max are a really good choice. They pump out clear, gloriously rich sound with solid separation. I am no audiophile, so I’ll not belabor this with “omg a unique magnesium cone!” minutiae. What I will say is that these headphones adeptly handled everything I threw at them, from the most annoyingly quiet Sufjan Stevens to colon-rupturing Swedish math metal. And they nailed the low note on Beastie Boys’ “Shake Your Rump,” which is the bass metric all headphones should be judged on. Beyond this, they’re thoughtfully designed, though their precious little charging purse is a bit much. So, yeah, if you’re intent on purchasing some high-end headphones, you’re not going to go wrong with these. But also: Groceries are a fun thing to have. —John Paczkowski Advertisement  
 


Casper Glow Light — $116 at CasperIt’s a very nice ambient light. You spin it to make it brighter or dimmer, which is both fun and handy. I use it as a bedside light and also as mood lighting in the living room when I watch TV at night.

Apple AirTags for my TV remote and rubber remote case — AirTags: $29 for one or $99 for four at Apple. Case: $7.99 at Amazon.The remote is by far the worst part of the older-model Apple TVs. It’s somehow super slippery in your hand and so light it feels hard to control. It’s super thin and small, the perfect size for losing between couch cushions. The newest 4K Apple TVs come with an improved remote, which is sold separately for $59, but that’s way more than I want to spend.So instead I put one of these rubber covers on my current remote. It makes it grippy and easy to hold, and the bright color is easy to find, which was great until my toddler decided it is her most coveted toy. Finding the remote very quickly became a daily, sometimes hourly issue. Either my daughter had run off with it, or an adult had hidden it from her to prevent that from happening. Advertisement  So I AirTagged the remote. The case has a special slot to accommodate Apple’s little item-tracking device. The “Precision Finding” feature in the iPhone’s Find My app makes it easy to find lost things like TV remotes with a visual tracking feature that approximates how far away an item is. And the extra weight the AirTag adds to the remote feels nice in the hand. If you’re only ever going to track a TV remote, you might consider Tile’s cheaper tracking device, but if you’re an iPhone person prone to misplacing more than one item (I wanted one for my keychain as well as my husband’s keys and one to stick in our car for the times I forgot where I parked), then the AirTag four-pack makes a lot of sense (Apple loaned me AirTags for review, but I liked them enough I bought my own.) —Katie Notopoulos
 


Janome 2212 sewing machine — $199 at AmazonAt some point last winter, I developed an itch for making things with my hands. I dreamed of becoming a DIY person, and that dream wore out my credit card. I bought paint, canvases, 10 balls of yarn, knitting needles, embroidery hoops, a hot glue gun that’s still sitting in my drawer, unopened. And in my frenzy, I also got a sewing machine, a Janome 2212 that Google led me to believe was “an easy sewing machine for beginners.”To my great surprise, it was not easy. Sewing machines have too many knobs and too many labels, too many sections to thread your string through and around, and yet are so finicky that you have to wonder why we’ve gone to the moon but can’t make a simpler, more efficient machine for sewing. It’s a messy and frustrating hobby, and it will fill up your room with scrap fabric and half-finished projects. I’ve lost entire days using this thing. I’ve made dresses, I’ve altered sweaters, and I’ve watched hours of YouTube tutorials explaining what the hell a French seam is and how to sew a zipper on. You have to follow instructions and be patient, two qualities I don’t care for. None of the clothes I’ve made have ever come out well; there’s always a loose thread somewhere and wonky stitching. But it’s also, somehow, meditative, and when you’re out in a dress you made and someone asks where it’s from, you get to say, “Thanks, I made it. Just don’t look too closely.” —Clarissa-Jan Lim
 


RadRover 6 Plus electric bike — $1,999 at Rad Power BikesI can’t afford the RadRover 6 Plus electric bike, but I was lucky enough to try it (Rad Power Bikes loaned BuzzFeed a bike to review) and, yes, I liked it. Loved it, actually. And I say that as someone who has never quite understood the electric bike phenomenon. But after this bike took me to a favorite fishing hole at 22 mph and then off-roaded me up a poorly maintained trail right to the water without requiring really anything of me or my rickety knee, I get it. I am not a bike expert. My last bike was stolen, and the one before that was a trashed Huffy Thunder Road. But I found the RadRover to be pretty amazing, though it is quite heavy and built like a small motorcycle. Great ride, good battery life, and very easy to use — even for e-bike Luddites like me. —John Paczkowski
 


Plasma Coil guitar pedal — $350 from Third ManThough you undoubtedly know Jack White best for his guitar work in bands like the White Stripes and the Raconteurs, he's doing some equally amazing things with Third Man Records, an independent label and, most importantly for the purposes of this review, a purveyor of a guitar pedal called the Plasma Coil. This is an apt name for a pedal that distorts the notes you play on a guitar by expressing them as a electrical discharges *you can see* courtesy a xenon gas–filled tube. Designed by Gamechanger Audio, the Plasma Coil literally amplifies audio signals to 3,500 volts. It sounds as badass as it looks — like a 50-pound wasp nest. It’s pretty much lightning in a box and an absolute blast to play. And if you dig the Plasma Coil, it’s worth noting that a few of Third Man’s other pedals are equally impressive, including the Bumble Buzz, (a sick fuzz box) and the Triplegraph (a digital octave pedal with individual octave-up and octave-down channels that make your guitar sound like a noise in a science fiction movie). —John Paczkowski
 


The Fantasy Trip: Legacy Edition role-playing game — $119 at AmazonSince I was (a) locked down at home and (b) no longer commuting, I had extra hours and nostalgia for the role-playing game of my adolescence — a criminally simple and fun one called the Fantasy Trip. Popular for its single-player adventures back in the 1970s and perfect for the pandemic era, the game was revived two years ago by its original designer in a legacy edition. A throwback to the mayhem-flavored era of pen-and-paper games, the easy but elegant rules allow for intriguing match-ups against monsters represented by cardboard square game pieces that evoke the era when light beer was new. Anyone who’s bored stiff at the thought of learning the latest gaudy Dungeons & Dragons rules but wants to bump off a band of bugbears, or who’s middle-aged enough to try to entice (force) your kids to do so with easy-to-learn rules, might give it a shot. I managed after a few tries to get my band of paper bravoes through a death test dungeon after a few weekends of on-and-off playing, and it has been a solace on rainy weekends ever since. In a nice mixture of old and new, I now play it over Roll20.net with an old high school buddy now living in Germany. —Dan Vergano
 


Lamicall metal phone stand — $9.99 at AmazonIn 2021, this became an essential part of my workstation. It allows my phone to act as a second screen (technically a third screen, since I already use a laptop plus a monitor).

Anker Nebula Cosmos 4K projector — $699 at AmazonWho needs a TV when any flat surface in your home is a screen? Anker’s Cosmos projector is remarkably good at playing movies on bare white walls with a clarity of picture and sound that will satisfy most everyone but AV aficionados. With Dolby Digital Plus 360° theatrical audio and a sharp 1080p resolution, a 900 ANSI Lumen autofocus display that can be recalibrated almost instantly and sharpened with the press of a button, the Cosmos solidly and accurately plays everything from home movies on a bedroom wall to Aliens on a bedsheet in your backyard.

The busy New York City block we live on poses challenges: barflies late at night, trash trucks first thing in the morning, and every other imaginable city noise in the hours between. That’s why we swear by white noise machines. My wife and I share one. My 18-month-old falls asleep to one.

Facebook Portal Go — $199 at PortalYes, there’s an irony that despite everything that BuzzFeed News has reported about Facebook over the past few years, I am recommending a Facebook product. If you want to feel truly pure about not supporting Meta, Facebook’s new parent company, well, go ahead and delete your Instagram account. It probably makes more money off showing you ads than the company would off a hardware purchase. I’ll wait.The truth is, the Portal is a great video chatting device. The smart camera follows you around the room and can accommodate more than one face at a time. It’s great for connecting distant grandparents and small kids, particularly the rechargeable Portal Go, which can be carried from room to room. My kid loves taking Grandma out into the yard to show off his toys and adventures. Advertisement     When I first tested the Go (Facebook loaned BuzzFeed a Portal to review), my one big complaint was that there was no way to fully disable the “Watch Together” function during a call, which can be an issue if you want to control the videos your kids watch. Meta’s head of VR and Portal promised to fix this. So starting in December, you can block Watch Together completely during calls. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Vilo mesh Wi-Fi routers — $70 for three at AmazonYou may have heard of this “mesh Wi-Fi” thing from your friends who have bigger houses and more tech smarts than you. The Vilo is the mesh router for everyone else. The idea is that instead of one crappy router you stash under your bed, you evenly space three futuristic white bricks throughout your house. As you walk from room to room, you’ll always have a clear, strong Wi-Fi connection. Why would someone who lives in a small Brooklyn apartment need three Wi-Fi routers? The obvious answer is: Why the hell not? Vilos are about $70 for three and surprisingly attractive for a router. By comparison, a fancy mesh system from Google is $349. Wirecutter’s “budget pick” is still $130. I loathe spending money, but these guys just make sense. —Scott PhamOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

Tervis insulated tumblers — $34.99 for a four-pack at Amazon2021 was the year I accepted that I needed some kid-friendly plastic drinking glasses for adults. They keep cold drinks cold for an impressively long time — I’ll leave an iced coffee out and find it two hours later with ice cubes still intact. Best of all, the insulation means no condensation sweat to leave rings on wood tables. They’re not the chicest-looking drinkware, but they’re perfect for daily use. —Katie Notopoulos Advertisement  
 


Casio travel alarm clock — $13.95 at AmazonI recently full-on slept through my phone alarm, which was...concerning. Though it did not totally fuck me over on that particular day, it was a wake-up call (lol) that my iPhone cannot be trusted as the sole thing to get me out of bed on time. I purchased a tiny, real alarm clock, and you should, too. It has performed its job of waking me up on time without incident, with the added benefit of not having the very first experience of the day be a blast in the face of the inevitable bad vibes of my phone. Plus, it's cute! —Addy Baird
 


A daily NYT crossword puzzle calendar — $14 at AmazonI refuse to look at my phone’s Screen Time, but I’m sure that in 2020 I spent at least 80% of my waking hours looking at my phone or laptop. I knew it was hurting my eyes and brain, but I struggled during quarantine to find a hobby I enjoyed that took me completely offline. At the end of that year, I bought a crossword puzzle calendar to give myself a daily task (I’m bad at hobbies so hobbies must be tasks) for 2021 that could take anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours to complete. I set myself rules to make it feel even more like an accomplishment (again I am not saying this is the right way to do things): I never google clues, but I can phone a friend. I can’t rip off a day until I’ve finished it (except for the times when I got behind by a week...catching up on that is too much pressure so I just rip seven days off in a chunk like they never happened). The compact page-a-day calendar was easy to take on trips to the woods where my friends would offer to help with the puzzle and then immediately get frustrated that they didn't know which seven-time Emmy winner a clue could possibly be referring to (Ed Asner). Patience is key with crosswords, and the joy of it isn't fun for the whole family, but rather a peaceful, solitary task that doesn't involve looking at my freaking phone. —Sarah Schweppe
 


LoveSac — $1,062–$1317.50 (on sale) at LoveSacA defining image of the pandemic for me is our 60-pound “puppy” cannonballing my unsuspecting daughter as she relaxed in the mountainous LoveSac that now sits, like a befurred and cuddly Jabba the Hutt in our family room. (LoveSac loaned BuzzFeed this item to review.) It’s difficult to describe just how comfortable and how much fun this thing is. Imagine sitting in a bathtub full of fur or a vast kangaroo pouch. Now, imagine doing it with another person. And now add a dog. The big caveat here is that you really need to have a good appreciation for the ridiculous to live with one of the larger LoveSacs as they are Raiders of the Lost Ark boulder–size, but wow, what a wonderful thing to watch movies from. —John Paczkowski
 


The Citizenry linen sheet set — $230 at The CitizenryYears ago when the direct-to-consumer bedding marker first emerged I bought a set of Parachute linen sheets. I remember being thrilled with them at the time, but they lost their color within a year and ripped soon after. So earlier this year we bought some new linen sheets from The Citizenry. I don’t often use the word lovely, but these sheets demand it. They are lovely, deliciously comfortable, and have withstood repeated washings inspired by a strong desire to ALWAYS have them on our bed, which is where I’m writing this because why not? —John Paczkowski
 


Nugget play couch — $259 at NuggetIn fall 2020, I wrote about how hard-to-buy Nugget play couches had become like Supreme drops for moms. The foam couch had grown a cult following through Facebook parent groups as a fun, fort-buildable couch that kids could climb on while doubling as playroom furniture that came in an Instagram-worthy array of colors. The pandemic created a surge in demand and a slowdown in production, resulting in a “drop” system where restocks would sell out within minutes. After publishing my article, I decided to buy one myself. Advertisement  My verdict: It’s absolutely worth the hype. My kid loves climbing and jumping on it, and the best endorsement I can offer any parent is that after an early evening session of Nugget play, he will conk right out at bedtime.There are now plenty of competitors to the Nugget couch, but a lot of them are way more expensive. Though colors are still limited, it’s possible to actually order one now. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Betta fish tank and supplies — tank, $27.99; filters, $8.49; and water conditioner, $2.49 at Amazon; betta fish, ~$5 at your local storeI absolutely did not want a fish. My son had been begging for a fish for months (downgraded from a dog at least), and I relented last January in a moment of pandemic-induced guilt. He couldn't have playdates with real children, but maybe he could have a fish companion. I dreaded cleaning the gross bowl, remembering to feed him, and having to explain his inevitable death to a small child. Advertisement  Turns out I was wrong. I love Swimmy, the blue betta fish. After a short-lived period of my son feeding him a single pellet in the morning and evening, I’ve taken over his feeding duties, and I enjoy it. I talk to Swimmy, greeting him in the morning and evening. I find the light in his tank a helpful nightlight in the kitchen — the one light that stays on, and his tank is even kind of attractive.Best of all, cleaning his tank is easier than I thought it would be. Instead of dumping all the water out weekly, you replace about a third of the tank every three to five days, while the fish stays in the tank (I just scoop it out with a measuring cup). —Katie Notopoulos
 


Hummingbird feeder — $25 at AmazonHummingbirds are assholes. (OK, just some hummingbirds are assholes. But they’re all adorable!) This I learned after hanging my first-ever hummingbird feeder, daring to hope that it would attract the eponymous visitors. (After being cooped up in a gloomy one-bedroom apartment for a year and a half during the pandemic, we finally moved this summer to a sunny place with a yard.)It didn’t take long — within hours, a colorful lil’ cutie was slurping up nectar (1 part sugar, 4 parts water, easy-peasy) and buzzing around the patio. News spread quickly and a number of their friends popped by — only to be chased away by the aforementioned asshole, who perched near the feeder and spent the whole day scaring off the competition (with a clicking noise we originally thought signaled an electrical problem). I decided I needed another feeder placed far enough away to satisfy other customers.Two feeders became four, four became six. For prime window viewing, I bought a couple of tall shepherd’s hooks. Now we (and our cats) can see the hummingbirds (most of whom are not assholes) from nearly every room in the house. Often when I’m outside replacing a feeder (every four to five days), a hummingbird will buzz around my head like I’m Snow White. Because of these tiny, extraordinary creatures, I experience joy — however fleeting — every single day. Even in 2021! Advertisement  I’ve got Amazon open in another tab, and I’m about to hit “buy now” on my seventh feeder. Can you blame me? —Dru Moorhouse
 


Outward Hound Invincibles stuffingless squeaky dog toy — $14 at AmazonBy the time our new ""puppy"" was 7 months old, he weighed 80 pounds and had probably destroyed his own weight in dog toys. We very quickly lost count of the ""indestructible"" plushies that were disemboweled and drawn and quartered in the one-puppy Battle of Helm's Deep that has been raging in our living room for months now. Only one toy has survived: an Outward Hound Invincibles snake. While he's been desqueaked, brutalized, and used to tow me around in an office chair, Severus Snake, as we call him, endures. He may well be immortal. —John Paczkowski
 


Just fill a sock with catnip, folksThis is Sir Jiggery Pokery, love of my life and the best decision I ever made. He is named after Antonin Scalia’s colorful dissent in King v. Burwell. (Scalia was a hilarious writer, as long as he was in dissent.) But Jiggers, bless him, has no love for cat toys. If it was made for cats, he is not interested in it, because, well, that’s how being a cat works.But he is not impervious to the chemical weaknesses of his kind. At some point during the pandemic, I got a big tub of catnip, took an unmatched sock, shoveled about a cup of the catnip into it, and tied off the top. Jigs promptly took the sock and wrapped it around his head, flailing about in the most feline of highs.Later that evening, he was running around the kitchen diving into empty Whole Foods bags, as one does, and he managed to get the handle of one stuck around his neck. Alarmed, he leapt into the air and ripped the bag in two. He then sprinted across the house, up the stairs, and under the bed, with half the paper bag flying behind him like a superhero cape. Advertisement     Anyway: Get a cat; they are one of life’s great delights. Then get a big tub of catnip and get him real high. —Emily Baker-White
 


Husky workbench as standing desk — $299 at Home DepotAfter 16 months of the pandemic, I figured it would be a good idea to get a desk for my apartment that would not also come with physical therapy for my body. I wanted an adjustable standing desk, but not something that cost $800+ or looked really stupid. I was lucky enough to have been tipped off to a secret: Workbenches sold by Home Depot intended for, I don't know, workbench stuff, actually make for perfect and cheap standing desks. This one is great — it looks fine, it comes on wheels if I need to clear space, it has a cool hand crank that's easy to use. And, best of all, it says “Husky” on it in big letters with a wolf head decal, which makes me feel very powerful while I stare at Tweetdeck. —Matt BermanOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News
"
343,"Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a Democrat and part of the Squad, sat down for a Q&A with BuzzFeed News to discuss possible vaccine mandates in schools.","


WASHINGTON — Rep. Jamaal Bowman, whose background includes 20 years in the public school system and more than a decade as a principal, says the Democratic Party does “not yet” have a compelling message on schools in the age of COVID.“​​So I’m biased, but I think education is the most important issue in our country, and I think we should always be talking about it,” Bowman said in an interview this week. “And because we don’t talk about it enough, we harm ourselves as a country.” Advertisement     That also means talking about vaccinating kids. The first-year member of Congress from New York and sitting member of the House Committee on Education and Labor said the onus is on the entire Democratic Party, including President Joe Biden, to engage with communities and have discussions about why there is so much hesitancy around the COVID vaccine. It’s notable for a Democrat to be calling out his party on ineffective messaging on a major issue with midterm elections less than a year out, when the party in power historically faces headwinds at the ballot box. And he says he supports vaccine mandates for students in public school systems.“There are many vaccines that babies have to take and many immunizations that need to be done before going to school. This now needs to be a part of that cocktail, because we are living in a new normal,” Bowman said as he sat in his Capitol Hill office, where a photo of the progressive group of lawmakers he belongs to known as “the Squad” is placed prominently, taken on the day Bowman was sworn in.His comments, made in an interview with BuzzFeed News on Wednesday, come at a time when schools have become a flashpoint in politics. And as vaccine access for children broadens, skepticism or outright antagonism over COVID vaccination is not letting up. “Republicans have made critical race theory, vaccines, vaccine mandates and disempowering parents part of their platform. You know, it’s part of the platform that led to McAuliffe losing in Virginia,” Bowman said.Though vaccine mandates in schools are still not widespread (the New York City Public Schools system where Bowman taught and the largest in the country, for example, has not implemented such a requirement, though the city has announced a mandate concerning children and “high-risk extracurriculars”), they have already become contentious in other areas. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced in early October that there would be a statewide mandate for schoolchildren following FDA authorization for the vaccinations, the first state to plan such a sweeping requirement. This reportedly prompted statewide protests. Advertisement     Given how narrowly Democrats hold Congress, it’s unlikely there will be federal action around vaccine mandates for students attending public schools. That would more likely be determined by the states and school districts. Yet Bowman says it’s imperative that the Democratic Party be able to have the conversations with constituents that will get them to a point where they will trust policies like vaccine mandates.BuzzFeed News spoke with Bowman about schools for nearly an hour, ranging in topics from vaccine mandates to other changes he thinks need to happen to the way education is looked at in the age of COVID. The following interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity:BuzzFeed News: Do you think that vaccine mandates are a good idea for schools and schoolchildren?Bowman: YesBuzzFeed News: Can you tell me a little bit about why?Bowman: So our kids have already lost so much. So much learning time, so much social time, so much of what being a normal child is about, that in order for them to come together again, and get back to the new normal, which even post-COVID is going to be different, everyone needs to be vaccinated for that. It’s similar to many vaccines that babies have to take and many immunizations that need to be done before going to school. This now needs to be a part of that cocktail because we are living in a new normal. We are living in a COVID-19 new normal. So yes, should be a part of it, and it’s not just school, right? It’s playing in the park, it’s gymnastics class, it’s other extracurricular activities that kids do socially with each other, which is so important to their development. In order to get back to that in a safe way for everyone, vaccines are going to be needed.BuzzFeed News: The flip side of vaccine mandates is that there are going to be a lot of parents who are going to be hesitant about their kids getting vaccines. So I wanted to ask about your ideas for educating kids who may not be vaccinated, many probably because their parents won’t want them to be, and how to make sure that they have access to the classroom? Advertisement     Bowman: Vaccine or not, I don’t know what school systems are going to do, but generally speaking, the mindset and behavior of an educator is to educate every child that’s in front of them to the best of their ability, so that absolutely has to happen. This goes back to, how are we engaging and educating parents and kids to feel more comfortable taking the vaccine? I think we can do a lot more work there. But yeah, in terms of religious exemptions, in terms of other reasons why people will refuse, those things are still in play, those things were in play before COVID, and parents were making certain decisions. And some parents, because they didn’t get the other cocktail of immunizations that they needed for public schools, decided to go other routes with their children’s education. But every child’s got a right to a quality education in whatever setting that the parent chooses for them. Me, as a public school educator, I’m biased towards getting kids back into public schools as soon as possible.BuzzFeed News: Do you support some of those exemptions if it’s the difference between whether a child will be able to attend class or not?Bowman: Yeah, I mean, it’s up to the parent. Parent’s voice in education is vital to their child’s education and their child’s development, so who am I to tell a parent that they should or shouldn’t do anything? And that’s where it gets complicated, because, in my opinion, children should be vaccinated and children should return to school. But if a parent chooses not to, that’s their choice.BuzzFeed News: Educators and support staff right now are exhausted, right, I’m sure you know this—Bowman: Yes, my wife is a third-grade teacher in a public school right now. So yes.BuzzFeed News: How does that factor into actually implementing policy like vaccine mandates for schoolchildren? What is the toll right now on teachers, staff, faculty — how does that affect in actually implementing and carrying out? Advertisement     Bowman: You know, a lot of teacher exhaustion right now is because of the stress related to not knowing if children are vaccinated or not, or if parents are vaccinated or not. So a vaccine mandate would reduce a lot of that stress and help teachers to feel more comfortable and at ease as they try to deliver their instruction. So it would help the exhaustion, it would help the stress, and it would help some of the unknowns that are in place now, especially if you’re teaching in a community with a high community spread and low vaccination rates, where my wife right now teaches in a community like that. Teachers are at tremendous risk right now. So a mandate and parents following that would help reduce the risk, and reduce the stress, and help teachers to be more effective instructors ultimately, because it’s hard to be a great teacher when you’re stressed out.BuzzFeed News: Schools are very much a political flashpoint, and that matters when it comes to elections. And so, how much do you think schools will consume the midterms that are now officially on the horizon?Bowman: A lot, I think. Because Republicans have made critical race theory, vaccines, vaccine mandates, and disempowering parents part of their platform. You know, it’s part of the platform that led to McAuliffe losing in Virginia. So I think a lot, and I think we will respond as a party, and I know I will respond personally to that. Because we have to have sensible, reasonable conversations about what happens in our schools and communities and how we educate our children. And flashpoint is not a word that should be associated with education, because that, the word itself, is harmful to the learning process, which is more methodical, and deliberate, and warm, and engaging. That’s how learning should happen in schools. Flashpoint is like shock treatment education, which is not what we need for kids, and not what we need for families. A lot of this stuff is very high-voltage stuff, where parents are like, really passionate about this stuff. And it takes leaders who have the courage to engage parents and listen and have difficult conversations but toward the ultimate goal of making sure your child is safe and receives an excellent education.BuzzFeed News: Do you think Democrats right now have a compelling message on schools in the age of COVID?Bowman: Well I’m a Democrat, so yes [laughs]. I have one [laughs]. At this moment, not yet. Not yet. But we’re working on that. We’re going to help them out. We’re going to help the party out. But not yet. And again, it’s not easy, I get it. But we will have it soon. I’m hoping. I’m hopeful. Advertisement     BuzzFeed News: What should be the national Democrats’ message on schools?Bowman: Even before the pandemic, but especially now, as we talk about schools, we have to talk about care. Care and schools need to be part of the same conversation. And everything that our schools should be doing right now has to be rooted in care for kids and for families and care in response to a global pandemic. So when people are enraged about critical race theory or vaccine mandates or any of that, it’s about care for your kids. Our kids. These are all our kids. That’s the compelling message: These are our kids.BuzzFeed News: Should national Democrats talk about schools and risk letting it become even more politicized, or leave it to states and local school systems?Bowman: Yes we should. We have to. So I’m biased, but I think education is the most important issue in our country, and I think we should always be talking about it, and because we don’t talk about it enough, we harm ourselves as a country, overall, and then individuals harm themselves, and communities continue to suffer harm because education isn’t at the top of the agenda. It’s below economy, it’s below gun rights, it’s below other things. But we, nationally, education should be a part of the Democratic platform in terms of the national conversation, yes, especially now.BuzzFeed News: I want you to imagine that you’re having a conversation with one of the parents you would have interacted with in your past job. What’s the best argument in defense of pursuing student vaccinations, and how do you make that a message that would resonate with the typical parent, parent/voter?Bowman: Well, the question assumes the parent is resistant to vaccines, right? So the first thing I would do is ask them why. Ask them how they feel about vaccines, vaccine mandates, and why are they resistant? And I would spend a lot of time listening. Then I would share what we know of the safety of the vaccine. And how it was developed, and how it’s been tested, and how that development and test compare to other vaccines that we already take that have been developed and tested, and how their child being at school supports their individual development and collective development of all children in that school and community.The first thing I would do is listen. Because a lot of times, we see these extreme reactions because no one is listening to anyone. We’re just telling people what to do, and commanding them what to do and we’re not listening. So the first thing I would ask is why, tell me what’s going on, tell me how you’re feeling, let’s have a conversation, let’s talk. And a lot of times when people get it out, they feel heard. They begin to develop trust in the person they’re talking to, and that trust is key to them ultimately deciding to get a vaccine or not, without any mandate. Mandates are a heavy-handed approach to, obviously a crisis, but sometimes I actually empathize with the resistance to that heavy-handed approach when you haven’t done the empathy work of actually listening and having a conversation. Advertisement     BuzzFeed News: When you say the Democratic Party has to do more, what entities, what people, what party leaders do you think the onus is on?Bowman: All of us. All of us, right? All of us. The party is asking us to have events to celebrate the recent passage of the infrastructure bill. Prior to that they wanted us to have a series of events celebrating the American Rescue Plan and child tax credit. Every member of Congress should have events around COVID vaccine hesitancy, to really gather data on why communities are hesitant. That’s events, that’s talking to people, that’s just engaging your constituents on this issue. And it’s all of us, and it’s on the president.BuzzFeed News: Is there any way to separate policies from politics? Or does policy just need to be crafted knowing that there will be blowback if it’s in the name of keeping kids safe?Bowman: First we gotta talk to each other. I had a conversation with a group of parents who were organizing around a remote option in terms of when schools were reopening, these parents wanted a remote option. And their argument was that some kids did better on remote, some kids weren’t ready to go back to school in large groups, with the pandemic unresolved, the virus unresolved, so they wanted a remote option. And the city at this time did not give a remote option. And they kind of forced everyone back to school. And I thought then and still think now that a remote option should be provided in all school districts. Because there are kids who, vaccine aside, deal with different social anxieties, where large groups in classrooms, large groups in schools, is really uncomfortable for them, and as a result they don’t perform well academically. So remote option can be good for certain kids. So I thought that was something that could have been provided that wasn’t. And that could still be provided.BuzzFeed News: What should we do for all of the students who have faced disruptions in learning because of the pandemic? What needs to be done to help make up for that?Bowman: We need more teachers. We need more learning spaces. So not just a traditional classroom but learning in spaces that are outside of that. We need more summer learning that’s targeted. All of those things need to happen, but it’s not just the cognitive academic learning, it’s also the social and emotional learning that we need to respond to as well. And more teachers helps to lower class size, and then using alternative learning spaces helps to lower class size. Also something called experiential learning. Kids learning outside about the environment, in the environment. Experiential learning, where they’re actually learning by doing in the environment. That’s really critical. Advertisement     BuzzFeed News: What should we be doing to make learning more resilient in the future against something like the pandemic?Bowman: When I started teaching, I didn’t have a teacher certification. A state certification. I just had a college degree. And New York City had a program that allowed me, with a college degree, to get a license to teach, and then I started teaching right away. If there were a way to have people who have college degrees who might be interested in teaching get this license and start teaching kids, that could be really powerful, and really helpful. And that’s important because more teachers, they’re not just falling off trucks.There could be mutual aid pods to support kids and their continued learning, even during a pandemic. And this was happening in different parts of the district, in my district, and the country as well. Home-school networks have like a framework on how to do some of this. And this is what we need to see. We need to see like, we got public schools, Catholic schools, private schools, charter schools, home schools, we got all these different models. The models have to sort of feed off each other to continue to support our kids, as we respond to COVID.BuzzFeed News: What am I not thinking to ask you?Bowman: Professional development. So, a huge part of being a great educator is always developing your craft. So it needs to be investments in professional development for teachers to cope with the first pandemic in 100 years. Right, like how do you deal with that? Like, my wife is at home trying to plan traditional lessons while managing the stress of not knowing if her kids or families are vaccinated or not, worried about putting her health at risk and the health of her family at risk. And then she’s being asked to do a mental health survey with her kids and then interpret the results with each kid so that she can be better at supporting the mental health of her kids. She got one webinar on how to do this effectively, so there needs to be a real investment in teacher professional development.And the last thing I’ll say is, how we’re training preservice teachers right now has to completely change because the world has changed due to the pandemic.With reporting by Dan Vergano.

344,"Operation Lone Star is “ironically allowing some of our clients to access asylum proceedings” that they normally would have been cut off from, one attorney said.","


A border operation launched by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to arrest undocumented immigrants has inadvertently helped asylum-seekers who would have normally been turned away to stay in the US, sometimes outside of detention facilities.Since Operation Lone Star started in March, state authorities have arrested hundreds of undocumented immigrants on state crimes for trespassing. It was created to combat human trafficking and drug smuggling by ""filling the gaps"" Abbott said are created when Border Patrol agents are preoccupied with apprehending immigrants. This summer, Abbott directed state troopers and Texas National Guard members to go to the border to arrest immigrants suspected of entering the US without authorization on state charges in an effort to deter others. Advertisement     But those arrests have led to unintended consequences. Currently, most immigrants at the border are being blocked from accessing the US asylum system since the Biden administration has continued to use a policy invoked by former president Donald Trump, known as Title 42, that cites the pandemic as justification to quickly expel immigrants at the border to Mexico or their home countries. However, some people arrested under Operation Lone Star have not only been able to stay in the US but also file asylum applications.Texas RioGrande Legal Aid (TRLA), which is providing legal aid to some immigrants swept up in Operation Lone Star, said that of the 120 asylum-seekers it has post-release information about, 115 of them have been able to stay and pursue their cases in the US.Audrey Mulholland, staff attorney and interim special project director for TRLA's Operation Lone Star Immigration Response, said that had the immigrants been detained by Border Patrol agents instead of state troopers, 43 of them would have been subject to Title 42 and immediately sent back to Mexico or their home countries based on their nationalities. Of those, 38 have been able to seek asylum in the US.""In the majority of cases, had they been apprehended by [Customs and Border Protection], I think their expulsions would've been likely and indeed some of them had previously been expelled pursuant to Title 42,"" Mulholland told BuzzFeed News. ""Operation Lone Star is ironically allowing some of our clients to access asylum proceedings that Title 42 robbed them of.""Immigrants from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Haiti, Brazil, and Ecuador are currently subjected to Title 42. Depending on their nationality, they can be expelled to Mexico or their home countries.
 


In Mulholland’s experience so far, most immigrants who wind up in state custody after being arrested by Texas troopers or the National Guard are issued an ICE detainer, which gives the immigration enforcement agency 48 hours from when someone is ordered released to pick them up and detain them. In cases where immigrants accept plea agreements, are released on personal recognizance bonds, or pay bonds to be released, ICE kept the detainer in place and would take them to one of its prisons instead of sending them to Customs and Border Protection, where they could then be expelled under Title 42. Without the arrest by state officials, immigrants apprehended by Border Patrol would have been processed by federal authorities carrying out expulsions.Abbott's office did not respond to a request for comment. But at a press conference on April 1, Abbott said the Biden administration had created an ""open season"" for human traffickers, drug smugglers, and criminal organizations.""Because the federal government is failing to act, to respond to these dangers, Texas is stepping up to secure the border and keep our communities safe,"" Abbott said. ""Operation Lone Star was launched for the purpose of filling the gaps left open as Border Patrol officers are busy, occupied, with detaining the large numbers of people who are coming across the border.""The operation’s focus on drug and human smugglers was expanded in July to undocumented immigrants themselves when he authorized state troopers and Texas National Guard members to arrest people suspected of crossing the border without authorization on misdemeanor charges like trespassing.From March to early November, 1,727 people were arrested for criminal trespassing, according to data obtained by BuzzFeed News through a public records request.
 


R. Dominguez, a Honduran asylum-seeker who was apprehended this summer near Del Rio by state troopers and members of the National Guard, spent more than two months in a Dilley, Texas, jail after being arrested.""It was terrible because I had no idea how long I would be in there,"" said Dominguez, who declined to be identified by his full name fearing it could affect his case. ""It was inhumane.""After a few weeks, attorneys with TRLA, who are appointed as public defenders for some immigrants arrested under Operation Lone Star, helped connect Dominguez with legal help to submit an asylum application.Dominguez was detained by ICE for about three weeks before being released. There were moments in detention when Dominguez wished he had been expelled to Mexico, but now that he is out of detention and living with his family, he said he's one of a lucky few.""It worked out for me, but I know of so many other people from my country who were deported,"" Dominguez said. ""Still, it was horrible and shocking the way we immigrants were treated through the entire process.""While Operation Lone Star has helped some immigrants, Mulholland, of TRLA, cautioned against seeing it as a win for asylum-seekers because of due process violations and the prolonged detention they endure.""It's an incredibly abusive program that has created a separate and unequal criminal justice system for immigrants,"" Mulholland said.Andani Alcantara Diaz, supervising attorney for removal in Austin for the immigrant advocacy organization RAICES, said detainees describe being woken up at 2 or 3 a.m. to have breakfast, which is sometimes a small piece of bread, then lunch at 10 a.m. and dinner around 4 p.m. Immigrants with diabetes who need to eat at certain times and more regularly to maintain their blood sugar levels aren't able to, Alcantara Diaz said.""Most of these people have been in custody for months at a time and they're pretty desperate,"" she said. ""It's bad for their mental health and their desire to fight their cases.""
 


Under Operation Lone Star, immigrants who are arrested are sent to a local jail where they are taken inside trailers and then have bail set by a magistrate judge over Zoom. The following day, they’re bussed more than two hours away to a prison in Dilley, Texas, that’s been converted into a jail for immigrants. There, they typically wait for months before seeing the inside of a courtroom, due in part to the operation overwhelming courts in border cities with misdemeanor cases.Kristin Etter, an attorney and special project director for Texas RioGrande Legal Aid who is providing legal assistance to immigrants arrested under Operation Lone Star, said her clients spend months, sometimes 80 days, in prison waiting for prosecutors to file charges against them, which goes beyond the time the state can legally hold someone in jail if charges haven't been filed. According to state statutes, someone detained for trespassing, like many of the Operation Lone Star arrestees, should be released 15 or 30 days after being arrested if prosecutors haven't filed charges.Moreover, Etter said, once charges are filed, clients are still spending 90 days or longer waiting for the court to set a hearing.Prolonged detention is not the only issue; the Texas Tribune reported that trespassing charges against dozens of immigrants arrested under Operation Lone Star were dropped because court documents filed by Kinney County prosecutors failed to point out what property the men were allegedly trespassing on.Etter also maintains that some of their clients accused of trespassing weren't actually on private land when they were arrested or were directed — and in some cases escorted — by state authorities to private land before being apprehended. Many other immigrants, Etter said, had no notice, such as a sign or a fence, telling them they were on private property.""Notice is the only thing that makes this a crime, and without notice, there can be no criminal trespass,” Etter said.If Abbott's intent is to jail immigrants as a deterrent to border crossings, Etter said her clients are not concerned with a low-level misdemeanor trespassing charge that has no impact on their asylum case. Immigrants are more concerned with being able to file their asylum cases and remain in the US while their claims are adjudicated, Etter said. Advertisement     ""It could potentially have the opposite effect because once arrested under Operation Lone Star, our clients have much more access to lawyers and advocacy organizations,"" she said. ""Had they been arrested by Border Patrol, they would've been expelled without even the chance to present an asylum case no matter how good their claim is.""
 


Immigrants who have their state charges dismissed are the ones who are being sent back to CBP and expelled under Title 42, said Maria Renteria, removal defense fellow for RAICES. But because this involves separate state and federal agencies, as well as different policies, there are no cut-and-dried rules, she said.""What one organization will tell you happened to a client might not be the case for someone else, even if procedurally their cases are exactly the same,"" Renteria told BuzzFeed News.It’s ironic, she added, that a program created by Texas to punish immigrants because it believes the federal government is being too lenient is actually helpful to some.""I don't think [Operation Lone Star] is going to be an effective deterrent in the way they're envisioning it,"" Renteria said. ""If family separation wasn't a deterrent … this is not going to stop them from taking their one shot that for many of them is the only way to have a future.""

345,"A judge ruled that the singer must face a jury trial over accusations that she lifted lyrics for her song ""Shake It Off"" from a 2000 song with the line ""playas, they gon' play"" and ""haters, they gonna hate.""","


Taylor Swift, riding high on the jubilant reception of her new album release, is going to trial over accusations that she lifted lyrics for her song ""Shake It Off"" from a 2000 song with the lyrics ""playas, they gon' play"" and ""haters, they gonna hate.""The copyright lawsuit, filed in 2017, alleged that Swift copied the lines ""players gonna play"" and ""haters gonna hate"" from a 3LW song, ""Playas Gon' Play,"" written by Sean Hall and Nathan Butler.The lawsuit was tossed in 2018 by a judge who declared the lyrics ""too banal"" to be copyrighted. Hall and Butler appealed the ruling, and a court reversed it in 2019, saying that their complaint ""still plausibly alleged originality."" Advertisement     Judge Michael Fitzgerald, who originally dismissed the case, denied Swift's request to do so again Thursday.In his ruling, Fitzgerald wrote that though Swift's team made ""persuasive arguments"" about how her hit 2014 song is different from ""Playas Gon' Play,"" there is a ""possibility that there is still a genuine dispute as to the potential substantial similarity between the lyrics and their sequential structure.""The case will go to a jury trial but a date has not yet been set.Peter Anderson, who is representing Swift in the lawsuit, did not respond to a request for comment. The singer's spokesperson told the Guardian that the lawsuit ""is not a crusade for all creatives, it is a crusade for Mr. Hall’s bank account.""Hall and Butler’s attorney, Marina Bogorad, told BuzzFeed News in a statement that they were ""extremely satisfied"" with the ruling.""It reinforces the notion that their unique self-expression based on the deeply rooted cultural heritage cannot be simply snatched away without proper attribution,"" Bogorad said. ""We are pleased that the court refused to engage into a battle of the experts, especially given that defendants’ resources vastly outweigh those of our clients here, and it is about time that justice should serve the merits rather than deep pockets.""On Friday, 3LW posted on social media to clarify that they are not behind the lawsuit, and asked Swift's fans to stop aiming their anger at the group.""There is nothing but love and respect for Taylor and her team,"" the group said. ""3LW had nothing to do with this case. Please direct all hate elsewhere.""
 


It's not the first time Swift has been sued over her lyrics in ""Shake It Off."" In 2015, musician Jesse Graham, who has a song called ""Haters Gonna Hate,"" sued her for $42 million, alleging that ""Taylor Swift would not have written 'Shake It Off' had he not written 'Haters gone hate.'"" Advertisement     That lawsuit was dismissed by a judge who cited a 2010 Urban Dictionary entry and 3LW's ""Playas Gon' Play"" as earlier examples of the term being used. Graham's song was released in 2013.Swift previously waged a public battle against Big Machine Records, her former label, and Scooter Braun, a music manager who bought the company in 2018, for allegedly barring her from performing her songs, whose masters it owns. At the time, Swift asked her fans to ""let [Big Machine CEO] Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun know how you feel about this.""In turn, Big Machine said it ""continued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties as she promotes her current record in which we do not financially participate.""Swift later announced that she would rerecord her first six albums. Her latest rerecording release, Red (Taylor's Version), was widely acclaimed.

346,"Ashley, who came out as nonbinary over the last year, and Isla, who is trans, spoke to us about their work and balancing life and art.","


When I first came across Isla Gordon and Ashley Kaye’s work in 2021, it stopped me in my tracks. Their photos are personal and relatable despite being about a very individual experience — how a couple and a home changes as both partners explore their gender identity.The two are partners in life and art — but life came first. They met at a camera store in 2011, quickly fell in love, and were married four years later. They have both used photography as a way to figure out domestic spaces and how they fit within the wider world. During the pandemic, both lost their jobs and their studios, and then left their home to live with family. Isla realized that she was transgender and began transitioning in 2020. Advertisement  Their images explore themes of searching, piecing pieces of a larger puzzle together around gender roles and their experiences living as different genders. Photos such as Isla naked on the lawn, covered in grass, or drinking a beer and working at her laptop outside in a lawn chair, speak to the realities of their nuanced domesticity. The images are a beautiful and interesting look at how we navigate traditional gender roles in our lives. Many of the questions raised within their work came about as Isla transitioned and as they went through life changes brought on by the pandemic.Their work will be on display in November in Re-form, a web exhibition publication from Stay Home Gallery, and in December at Satellite Art Show and Performance Is Alive at Miami Art Week, as well as at Illuminate Art Walk in Raleigh, North Carolina.Ashley, who came out as nonbinary over the last year, and Isla both spoke to us about their work, balancing life and art, and the new home in Pennsylvania they moved into this year. Advertisement  
 


Isla Gordon: The project we’ve been working on most recently is called Starter Home. I have a colleague who has called it “elevated documentary,” but Ashley doesn't love that word. It's a project documenting our lives in the most honest way. I chose the name Starter Home because a starter home is a weird, untenable thing. It's a new beginning, but it's temporary. You have this home, you fix it up, you sell it in a couple of years. It's a weird inflection point that seemed to mirror where we were at. It's aspirational, but it's wabi-sabi — things are going to be in flux and transient.The physical realities of the space are that things are constrained and laid out. The photos themselves show moments of intimacy, some of them are more constructed, and some of them unpack the tasks of the home. It's reckoning with stuff that was modeled by our mothers and fathers, which carries its own weight. The “oh damn, we need to make some art” would be moments like my father asking me when I was going to cut “it” off (referring to the hedge trimmer photograph), or [my father] telling Ashley to not let me use my gender to get out of lifting heavy things, or my mother telling me that she never let me go to therapy as a teen because she didn't want me turning out gay. Advertisement  Ashley Kaye: With Starter Home, and our art more broadly, we want to show people a space like this and what a queer marriage or a queer household can look like. When we moved back to Pennsylvania, we left a little grad school bubble, which, for all its problematic power structures, was still a much freer, accepting space. A lot of our friends and family weren't ready for this. No one knew how much growing and learning we had done, and that was a shock to us because we were getting more and more comfortable in our skin.Isla: I got into photography mainly as a way of navigating my relationship with the world, and it's been a journey ever since. I was born and raised in Pennsylvania, and I have had a variety of different career starts and stops. I was in culinary school, cooked at nice resorts and nice kitchens, and then I went to grad school to get my MFA in photography and related media.
 


Ashley: After Isla got her MFA, I went to the University of Arkansas school and got my MFA in studio art, but with a focus in photography. A lot of my work has to do with our domestic space, figuring out our relationship and my relationship to other people, as well as my relationship to myself. I was raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as Mormons, and then left. I’ve been figuring out who I am without the church for years.Pretransition, Isla was very quiet, and photography was a way to study her without sitting down and staring at her and asking her a ton of questions. We would go on nature walks, and I would take pictures as we went. That's how that project of us taking pictures of each other started. It was a part of my thesis work, of leaving the church and my self-discovery, who I was without the church, who I wanted to be, and who I wanted to be in our relationship. Advertisement  In those three years while we were working on the project, Isla came out as nonbinary. Toward the end of my thesis year, she came out to me as transgender. As we dealt with it, we still took photographs. Isla's growing awareness of her own gender identity allowed her to be a more active participant, especially in Starter Home.Isla: Initially, I submitted to the photographs because I cared about Ash and wanted to support them, but I was a much more passive participant. I would improvise a little bit in the studio, but I was reluctant, perhaps scared, to engage with the process.As I saw the photos that Ashley took, I started to realize that there were things in there that I liked, and I was like, What is that? Who is that? The way that they photograph me, there's a lot of softness and vulnerability, and that created a really positive feedback loop. I continued to unpack my feelings and played a little more active role with one of our first truly collaborative photos, “Womanless Wedding,” where I squeezed into a thrift store wedding dress.When I realized I was trans and came out, it began to evolve into a more deliberate but also edifying project to try to present myself in the way that I feel like deep down, this is the person I could be. Advertisement  Ashley: We are building a new relationship and a new marriage in a domestic space that we had never been in before. Queer, trans, what does that look like outside of the church and traditional gender presentation? Once we started working through it, we realized that a lot of these issues were always there in our marriage, and this had allowed us to work with them on the surface.
 


Isla: Transitioning has been a lot. I am pretty single-minded and oblivious, so it took me forever to realize because I would always find something else to project all my anxieties into. For a while that was my art. When we were living in Arkansas, I was possessed in the studio. In the pandemic I had to give up my studio, so I didn't have the same sort of outlet or distraction. Removing the studio component allowed me to stay awake staring at the ceiling all night and thinking about who I really was. I joke about it, but it was really over a few sleepless nights when I realized [that I was transgender]. Advertisement  I told Ashley, and we went to town and I bought a pair of shoes and borrowed some of Ashley's shorts and we went out on the town. We went to lunch and to a museum, and I felt unselfconscious for the first time in my life, I felt great. I looked a hot mess, but I felt amazing.Ashley: She did not [look a mess]!Isla: After we moved to Pennsylvania, we were living with my mom and we were looking for work. I started working with a therapist, because this is a big thing and I wanted to be sure. From coming out to Ashley to coming out to family was a few months, and I came out publicly in March 2021 on Trans Day of Visibility, and it's been full steam ahead.There's a lot of unlearning about the expectations — the same ones we have in the home, I constructed my whole life around them. The idea that I needed to derive my worth or prestige from an academic posting at a great school, I realized that I don't actually need that. It's been a lot of sort of discovering those types of things, and I put so much pressure on myself, around art and around everything, how I present, it's been nice to not feel that external pressure and to be a little more authentic. Advertisement  Isla: There were so many expectations that were placed on us that we performed because we felt like it was expected or encouraged. Cooking, cleaning, taking care of the finances.Ashley: We realized how unhappy we were, and it was a big part of taking on new roles of representation. We want to show people a space like this and what it looks like.
 


Isla: Expectations and pressures around gender roles were underlying all of the conflict in our marriage. We would fight about things like money, with Ashley and her family having this expectation that I would control the finances and mete out money to her as needed. My reluctance to occupy the patriarchal head of household role was less about the role than the patriarchal association. The same could be said for my lacking contributions to cleaning and all the pressure Ashley feels to keep a clean house.Isla: It's so frustrating when you're trying to find stories about yourself and what you see is cliché, reductive, or bad, and it can feel really lonely.We try to be authentic and avoid cliché as much as possible, and try to share and photograph those moments that are not so easily readable. The moments when you're feeling insecure or not sure and like you're just on the precipice of something new. The highest compliment we can get is when someone sees their experience in our art.Ashley: We're looking forward to continuing Starter Home through the seasonal changes. It's so much about us figuring out who we are inside the house. I think that will happen as we stay in the house and keep growing. In the future, I would like to have an exhibition. We see it in a space in the future where we can create a space for queer expression. It's what I want to do and bring in some more installation elements. Advertisement  Isla: I would say that I am most excited to start arranging our work in a book or zine form. I have an ongoing fascination with family albums and their gendered history, and it seems like the perfect vessel for a lot of the ideas we are exploring.

347,"Republican senators voted to pass a bill they’re against, so they can vote against the bill they let pass.","


Congressional jostling reached new and confusing heights Thursday as senators voted to disenfranchise themselves in order to avoid a government default.It is the dramatic conclusion of a monthslong staredown between Republicans and Democrats with the nation’s finances hanging in the balance. Also, it involves such convoluted political and legislative maneuvering that exactly what happened is all but impenetrable to anyone other than politicians and the people paid to watch them. Advertisement     The short version is this: The Senate needs 60 senators to vote to raise the debt ceiling, stopping the US government from running out of money and defaulting on its debts and shutting down. Republicans don’t want to raise the debt ceiling, but they also don’t want to be held responsible for a government shutdown. So they voted to let their votes not matter.All 50 Democrats and 14 Republicans voted to advance a bill that does not lift the debt ceiling but does create a one-time change to the rules so that Democrats can pass another bill in a week or so to raise the debt ceiling with only 50 votes. Having voted to ensure their votes don’t matter, Republicans can now vote against the second bill later this month.This means that the worst-case scenario — a government default, mass furloughs before the holidays, markets crashing — will be averted.“I am optimistic that after today’s vote we will be on a glide path to avoid a catastrophic default,” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.For a quick refresher on the legislative process, here is how, in 2021, a bill becomes a law:Occasionally, Congress needs to raise the debt ceiling, the arbitrary cap on how much money the American government can borrow. But sometimes the party that is not in power doesn’t want to raise the cap as an act of protest. Sometimes that party doesn’t want to be seen voting to raise the debt ceiling while they’re campaigning against the majority party’s $1.5 trillion social spending and environment bill that they say will cause too much debt. Advertisement     And sometimes the minority party’s former president launches a pressure campaign from his Florida compound urging them to use the debt ceiling to “totally kill” the current government. Sometimes that party is very attuned to the demands of their former president because politicians who disobey him have a tendency to be taken out back and shot, metaphorically speaking, when it comes to primary races.One option is for the minority leader in the Senate to send a strongly worded letter to the president vowing not to help lift the debt ceiling. The leader could argue that the majority can raise the debt limit on their own if they use a process called budget reconciliation.The risk there is that the majority leader in the Senate might respond, hold on, he doesn’t want to use budget reconciliation because that’s annoying and time consuming and keeps him from doing other stuff he wants to do like confirming nominees. So he doesn’t do it. And then it becomes a standoff as the country heads towards a fiscal cliff until one side blinks.That’s how Congress got here. Ultimately, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell caved on his threats and agreed to help Democrats lift the debt ceiling.To make it more palatable for Republican members to go along with it, the parties agreed on an unusual plan. The Senate voted 64–36 Thursday to override the filibuster on a bill to avoid Medicare cuts. Tucked in that bill are special provisions allowing Democrats to pass a filibuster-proof debt ceiling increase later this month with only 50 votes. The Senate voted later Thursday to pass the measure, 59–34.Democrats in the House voted to pass the Medicare bill earlier this week, meaning it can now go to Joe Biden’s desk.In the end, everyone is relieved but no one is happy. Democrats have one less thing to worry about but are still fighting over their Build Back Better Act. Republicans who voted for the debt ceiling deal painted it as necessary to avoid catastrophe. Other Republicans, including the former president, say McConnell made a mistake and should never have cut a deal in the first place. Advertisement     Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy was asked why he voted against the deal as he left the Senate chamber. Channeling the zeitgeist of Congress, he paused, hemmed, and hawed for 18 seconds before saying, “I would have preferred a different process.”

348,"And Just Like That, we’ve got another cringey reboot.","


In the highly anticipated limited series reprisal of Sex and the City, HBO Max’s And Just Like That…, nobody’s having a particularly good time — Sarah Jessica Parker’s Carrie Bradshaw least of all.Poor Carrie. By the end of the first episode, she’s suffered a couple of tragic losses — one more ambiguous, one sadly definitive — and she no longer knows what to do with herself. Though she’s apparently working on another book, it doesn’t seem as though writing remains a central focus of her life, which is a shame; her iconic voiceovers have been reduced to a single “And just like that…” at the end of every episode, with a short fill in the blank. (I won’t spoil it, but the first one is so shocking and stupid that I laughed aloud.) Advertisement     Instead of pouring herself into her column, 55-year-old Carrie is trying to up her social media game and get more candidly raunchy on a sex and gender podcast, her only recurring gig. She’s “representing the cisgender women” on the show, which is helmed by nonbinary comedian Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez), who is, unfortunately, not very funny.There aren’t a lot of laughs to be had in general throughout these first four episodes (two are streaming now on HBO Max, and the next two were made available to critics). At around 45 minutes long, they seem to fall more firmly on the drama side of the comedy-drama spectrum, whereas the original series kept installments short ’n sweet, and overall exuded more gaiety, more fun.At the beginning of the pandemic, I binged all of Sex and the City, for probably the fourth or fifth time in my life, and I felt immediately at home among a group of women who were always trying to make each other laugh, even and especially when times got hard. Of course, I didn’t feel too at home; escaping into a far more elegant and exciting universe than my own was also one of the series’ great draws. But as has been the case with other reboots from the past couple of years — Gossip Girl and The L Word come to mind — modernizing the original’s much-beloved and extremely glamorous world has for some reason meant making it drearier, more awkward, and overall less joyful to inhabit.
 


Like those other shows, And Just Like That… has a more diverse cast than its source material: four new characters are all people of color. But so far, they seem to exist mostly in service of the original white women. Che, for example, encourages Carrie to let her freak flag fly, provides a learning experience in gender diversity for Charlotte, and stirs some long-dormant sexual feelings in Miranda. (That last part I can get on board with, and not only because so many of us have wanted our favorite bossy short-haired lawyer to explore her queer side for ages now: Remember the “sex” in the original Sex and the City? I’d like to see some of that, please!!!)In my least favorite plotline, Miranda is taking classes for her master’s degree with Dr. Nya Wallace (Karen Pittman), and the two have become friends despite the fact that Miranda keeps dumping a bunch of bizarre racial microaggressions all over Nya whenever they interact. Neither am I a fan of Charlotte’s budding friendship with Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker), a documentary filmmaker who forces Charlotte to realize that she has no other Black friends. It feels true to both Miranda and Charlotte’s characters that they’d be clueless though well-meaning Karens on their respective journeys toward some sense of racial consciousness, but their blunders do not make for pleasant television.
 


One of the best things about the original show was how expansive the world felt. You wanted to live in Carrie’s New York: one where there’s always some hot new bar or restaurant to try, where traversing to a different borough means ill-fated adventures with good-looking strangers. In the reboot, we’re postpandemic — I envy these characters, for whom COVID is ancient history to quip about rather than the present-day nightmare it remains for us in the real world — which should mean the city coming joyously alive again, back and better than ever. The show does make its way around Manhattan, but only because Carrie is too depressed to eat or sleep, so she just glumly walks everywhere. In the process, New York has been reduced to mere backdrop: Not only is there barely any sex in this new Sex and the City (except the teenaged kind had by Miranda’s son, Brady — gross), there’s barely any city, either. Its most prominent role now is as a vintage charm on Carrie’s necklace, an outline of New York state replacing the gold nameplate of her youth.Okay, the good: Carrie still looks fabulous, if a little bonkers, which feels just right. Longtime costume designer Patricia Field didn’t return for the reboot — she’s too busy working on Emily in Paris, which only wishes it was as good as the original SATC — but her legacy lives on in Carrie’s signature maximalism. My favorite outfit so far has Carrie colorblocked in a suit of different shades of blue, topped off with a string of pearls and a necklace studded with a big blue gem in the shape of a heart, à la Rose’s in Titanic. Surprising, on the verge of tacky, completely over the top, especially for a casual weekday podcast taping — that’s Carrie. That’s fun! It’s too bad most of the show’s lightness and whimsy is confined to the clothes.You’d have to imagine that the ladies would be having more fun — and more sex — if Samantha were still around. Sadly, it seems highly doubtful that the show’s most convivial character will ever return, since Kim Catrall retired the role when she turned 60, her long-running feud with SJP and other cast members likely spurring the decision. I almost wish the show had decided that the ladies had simply drifted apart, rather than turning Samantha’s absence into yet another bummer for Carrie to be sad about.There’s still time for the series to turn itself around: for the new characters to get their own dedicated plotlines, rather than driving everybody else’s; for Carrie to figure out what comes next; for Miranda to hopefully have some hot gay sex. Obviously I’m going to watch no matter what. But I hope morale improves, for both these characters’ sakes and for ours. ●

349,"Wright, 20, was killed by former Minnesota police officer, Kim Potter, who mistakenly fired her gun instead of her Taser during a traffic stop.","


In tearful testimony Thursday, the girlfriend of Daunte Wright, who witnessed him being fatally shot by a former Minnesota police officer in April, described her futile attempts to save his life.“[He] wasn’t answering me and he was just gasping,” Alayna Albrecht-Payton, 20, said while testifying for the prosecution on day two of the trial of ex-Brooklyn Center cop Kim Potter.Albrecht-Payton, who had been dating Wright for a few weeks before his death, was a passenger in the car when he was killed.""I grabbed whatever was in the car. I don’t remember if it was a sweater or a towel or a blanket or — I just grabbed whatever… and put it on his chest like you see in movies and TV shows,"" she said. Advertisement     “I didn’t know what to do, so I just put my hands over his chest and tried to hold [the wound] and tried to scream his name. I just tried to have him talk to me. I just kept saying, ‘Daunte, Daunte, just say something please, just talk to me.' And he just couldn’t — I know he tried, I know he wanted to.""I replay that image in my head daily,"" Albrecht-Payton said.Potter, 49, who had been a 26-year veteran of the Brooklyn Center police force before resigning days after the shooting, faces felony charges of first-degree and second-degree manslaughter in connection with Wright's death. She has pleaded not guilty to both charges.Wright, a 20 year-old Black man, was pulled over for a traffic stop in suburban Minneapolis on April 11. When police ran his information, they discovered that he had an outstanding arrest warrant for a gross misdemeanor weapons violation.As Potter and her partner attempted to put him under arrest, Wright began to flee the scene. Potter warned Wright that she would use her Taser on him, but drew her handgun and shot him once in the chest. In body camera footage, Potter can be heard saying, ""I just shot him. ... I grabbed the wrong (expletive) gun!""Wright had started the car when he was shot, and the vehicle moved a short distance down the street before crashing into another car.Albrecht-Payton said that Wright was frightened and didn’t want to get out of the car when they were first pulled over by the police, but he ultimately followed the officers’ instructions.“He was really scared; I’d never seen him like that before,"" she testified. ""If you know Daunte, he’s just really happy and positive and you can’t be sad or depressed or angry around him. He was just so nervous and flustered.”
 


Wright had been on the phone with his mother up until the moment he attempted to flee the scene. Albrecht-Payton said that moments after the shooting, she answered his mother’s video call on Wright's phone.""I was delirious, I was just screaming, 'they just shot him, they just shot him,'"" she said.Wright’s mother, Katie Bryant, testified Wednesday that Albrecht-Payton was screaming when she answered the phone call.""She said that they shot him and she faced the phone toward the driver's seat,"" Bryant said. ""My son was lying there.""In her testimony, Albrecht-Payton apologized to Bryant for turning the camera on Wright, saying that no mother should have to see her dead son.“I pointed the camera on him,” Albrecht-Payton said. “And I’m so sorry I did that.”She said that Wright's foot had been on the car's gas pedal when he was shot, and the car continued moving down the street despite being driverless and crashed into another car.Albrecht-Payton sustained serious injuries in the accident, including lacerations, a concussion, a broken jaw, and an ear injury that required stitches. Video footage played in court Thursday showed that officers restrained her in handcuffs after she exited the car.During cross-examination, one of Potter's lawyers, Earl Gray, questioned Albrecht-Payton on the couple's activities before they were pulled over, and she told the court that they had smoked marijuana earlier in the day, but that neither she nor Wright were impaired. She also denied that Wright continued his attempt to flee the scene after he was shot.While both sides agree that the evidence shows Potter mistakenly fired her handgun instead of her Taser, prosecutors have argued that the former officer failed in her duty, while Potter's lawyers described it as an innocent mistake.""We trust [police] to know wrong from right, and left from right,” prosecutor Erin Eldridge said during opening statements on Wednesday. “This case is about an officer who knew not to get it dead wrong, but she failed to get it right,"" she said. Advertisement     Eldridge pointed out that Potter had ""trained for years"" to prevent the specific scenario that led to the shooting.One of Potter's lawyers, Paul Engh, described Wright's death as a tragic and completely unforeseen mistake in a high-pressure situation.“An error can happen,” he told the jury on Wednesday. “We are in the human business. Police officers are human beings. And that’s what occurred.""Potter could face more than a decade in prison if convicted.

350,"The lawsuit alleges that school officials “failed the students at Oxford High School at virtually every turn” in the shooting that killed four students, an attorney representing the family said.","


The family of two Oxford High School students has filed a lawsuit over the Nov. 30 shooting that killed four students and injured seven others, alleging everyone from teachers to administrators failed to keep the campus safe ""at virtually every turn.""Filed Thursday, the federal lawsuit alleges that officials at the Michigan school district played a part in failing to prevent the shooting and protect students, including the family's two daughters, Bella Franz, 14, and Riley Franz, 17. Advertisement     Riley, a senior, was shot in the neck, and Bella ""narrowly escaped the bullets discharged towards her,"" the lawsuit states.""We have filed a federal lawsuit ... alleging that the counselors, teachers, the school administrators who failed the students at Oxford High School at virtually every turn, therefore violating the civil rights of the Oxford High School students who were injured and killed during the slaughter,"" Geoffrey Fieger, the attorney representing the family, said at a news conference.School principal Steven Wolf and district superintendent Tim Throne, as well as two counselors, two teachers, and a staff member — all unnamed — are listed as defendants in the $100 million lawsuit.The lawsuit once again spotlights the role of school officials in the events leading up to the shooting. Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald previously laid out concerns brought up by two separate teachers over the suspect's behavior in the classroom, including one incident that led to the school calling his parents in for a meeting hours before the shooting.

In a letter on Saturday, Throne said school counselors who spoke to the suspect both times had concluded that he did not intend to harm himself or others, and the incidents were not elevated to the principal or assistant principal.""Given the fact that the child had no prior disciplinary infractions, the decision was made he would be returned to the classroom rather than sent home to an empty house,"" Throne wrote. ""While we understand this decision has caused anger, confusion and prompted understandable questioning, the counselors made a judgment based on their professional training and clinical experience and did not have all the facts we now know.""
 


The students at Oxford High, and the Franz teenagers in particular, ""would have been safer had the Individual Defendants not taken the actions they did,"" the lawsuit states.Included in court documents are details about a Nov. 16 correspondence between ""multiple concerned parents"" and the principal about ""threats to students made on social media.""""I know it's been investigated, but my kid doesn't feel safe at school,"" the parents told Wolf.Wolf, in turn, assured parents that there were no threats at the school, the lawsuit states.""I know I'm being redundant here, but there is absolutely no threat at the HS ... large assumptions were made from a few social media posts, then the assumptions evolved into exaggerated rumors,"" he wrote.On Nov. 12, administrators posted a note online acknowledging rumors circulating in the school that had ""created some concern for students and parents."" Some of the rumors stemmed from an incident the week prior in which a deer head was found on the school courtyard (law enforcement officials have said that incident was unrelated to the shooting), the note said, while others were not connected. Advertisement     ""Please know that we have reviewed every concern shared with us and investigated all information provided,"" school administrators said. ""Student interpretations of social media posts and false information have exacerbated the overall concern. We want our parents and students to know there has been no threat to our building nor our students.""It's unclear what exactly those rumors were about. The lawsuit also does not explicitly say where or whom the threats came from and if the correspondence between Wolf and the parents was related to the school's Nov. 12 note. BuzzFeed News did not immediately hear back from Wolf or Throne.It's not the first time families of the victims and survivors have sued a school district over a shooting. The families of the 2018 Parkland school shooting victims sued the district before reaching a $25 million settlement this year.

351,"The director’s lavish vision proved too much for Hollywood studios, but an ether-backed collective has vowed to bring it into public view at last.","


Bound in sky blue cloth and marked with the number 5, the manuscript had lain dormant in a private collection for almost half a century. Between its covers is a doomed vision that the legendary filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky had described as “the coming of a God”: his plans to turn Frank Herbert’s sci-fi classic, Dune, into one of the most ambitious films ever made.To execute his vision, Jodorowsky assembled a phalanx of celebrated artists, visual effects experts, illustrators, and designers. Pink Floyd agreed to do the music. Salvador Dalí would play the emperor of the universe (for a fee of $100,000 per minute of screentime). Orson Welles was to play the evil Baron Harkonnen. Even Mick Jagger signed on.To sell the idea to Hollywood studios, Jodorowsky’s producers printed 20 luxurious volumes detailing the screenplay, illustrations, and designs in what he referred to as a “director’s bible.”The studios passed, and Jodorowsky’s film was never made. (Dune, the novel, has since been adapted twice — a 1984 version directed by David Lynch and the first part of Denis Villeneuve’s two-part adaption, which was released this year.) Over time, the bibles, which attained almost religious status among reverential scholars and sci-fi obsessives, vanished from the public eye. Until this November, when number 5 came up for auction at Christie’s. Appraisers thought it would sell for about $40,000. Advertisement  They were wrong.The winning bid was $2.9 million, placed by Soban Saqib, a 25-year-old cryptocurrency nerd, NFT collector, and freshly minted millionaire from Woodland, California.“This is pretty much my entire liquid net worth,” said Saqib, who goes by “Soby,” soon after the auction. “But I fronted the $3 million knowing that the community has my back.” Advertisement  The community in question is TheSpiceDAO, a network of Dune-loving cryptocurrency enthusiasts — most of whom have never met each other in person — who hatched the plan to liberate the sacred volume from private ownership and make it available, in some form or another, to all the obsessives who have long dreamt of flipping through its pages.“It’s almost like a jailbreak kind of situation,” Saqib said. One idea is to make an animated film inspired by the volume. Another is to hold frequent IRL viewings where enthusiasts can see it for themselves.A 25-year-old staking $3 million on the promise that his internet friends will somehow pay him back may sound terrifying, but a day after the auction, Saqib seemed sanguine.“I want to fulfill an unattained dream,” he said, explaining that he had been captivated by Dune when he first read it and was blown away by a 2013 documentary that detailed Jorodowsky’s ecstatic embrace of the project and the agony of his rejection.A week later, TheSpiceDAO asked its members for $6 million — $3.8 million, after taxes and legal fees, to buy Jodorowsky’s bible, and another $2.2 million to make an animated film inspired by his vision. By the next day, the donations from thousands of friends, well-wishers, and perfect strangers totaled $12 million.“I woke up this morning and my jaw dropped,” Saqib texted over WhatsApp. “I told you the community had my back!!!!” Advertisement  
 


A Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO, is often described as an internet community with a bank account. TheSpiceDAO (initially called DuneDAO) came together two days before the Christie’s auction when one of Saqib’s friends realized the bible was on sale. They set up what amounts to a cryptocurrency version of a GoFundMe. Anyone who contributed funds became a member and got voting rights to decide how to proceed.DAOs have been around since at least 2016. The first one — called The DAO – got hacked, but this has been a wild year for this new type of financial collective.The 10 biggest DAOs currently hold almost $20 billion worth of cryptocurrency in their treasuries. In October this year, PleasrDAO revealed itself as the winner of a $4 million auction to buy an unreleased Wu-Tang Clan album. In November, 17,000 people organized themselves as ConstitutionDAO and raised $47 million in a week in an impressive but ultimately unsuccessful bid to buy a rare copy of the US Constitution. Advertisement  A big reason for all this financial flexing is the dizzying appreciation in value of digital art such as NFTs and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. Many holders of these currencies are suddenly dollar millionaires looking for investment opportunities for their newfound wealth.In August this year, for instance, Saqib sold an NFT that looks a lot like LA Rams wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. He sold it to Odell Beckham Jr. himself for $2.7 million worth of the cryptocurrency ether.The NFT was a CryptoPunk, meaning it was one of a set of 10,000 unique digital characters that have become valuable collectors' items. Saqib sold Beckham Jr. the 3,365th character in the series. Digital files can be endlessly replicated, so each CryptoPunk comes with its own nonfungible token, or NFT — a digital certificate of authenticity that contains the web address and ownership information of the “original” copy.Cryptocurrency has been on a red-hot run this year. For example, the 888 ether that Beckham Jr. paid Saqib for his CryptoPunk was worth $2.7 million when it was transacted just back in August. It’s now worth almost $4.2 million. Advertisement  “Most early crypto people aren’t elite investors,” said Charlie/Charlotte Fang, an artist and a member of Remilia, an avant net art collective whose members are also founder members of TheSpiceDAO. “They are just gamers and programmers who got into crypto because they were close to the technology.” As a result, cryptocurrency’s new millionaires often think of their wealth, and how they spend it, very differently than bankers and hedge fund managers do. This impulse seems to have informed TheSpiceDAO’s decision to purchase the Dune bible.The plot of Dune, a sprawling series of six novels, follows the fate of many factions of an interplanetary civilization as they battle for control of a desert planet called Arrakis — the source of a mysterious substance called the spice, or melange. If there is one throughline to be found across all the sequels and prequels, it is the power of collective uprisings against the old noble houses grown decadent with ill-gotten wealth.Much of the internet learned of Jodorowsky’s manuscript through a 2013 documentary called Jodorowsky’s Dune, which features long, hypnotic sequences of illustrations from the bible while the surrealist director speaks of his project in messianic overtones. The fact that Hollywood executives found Jodorowsky’s adaptation too far out for their tastes has only contributed to its aura.
 


“Because the film was not made, but because all this creation happened, it became more powerful and it got a life unto itself and it permeated the world and many aspects of our culture in an inexplicable way,” Frank Pavich, the director of the documentary, said this week.Jodorowsky and his collaborators created a visual language that influenced a generation of Hollywood movies — most visibly, Ridley Scott’s Alien, which was written by Dan O’Bannon and designed by H.R. Giger, both Jodorowsky collaborators.In the documentary, the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn describes a late-night dinner in Paris at which Jodorowsky pulled out his copy of the Dune bible and talked him through every scene.“In a way I’m the only guy who ever saw Jodorowsky’s Dune,” Refn says. “I am the only spectator who has seen the movie and I’m going to tell you something — it's awesome!”BuzzFeed News reached out to Jodorowsky through his social media accounts, his literary agent, and his family, but did not receive a response. Advertisement  “Jodorowsky’s bible, this manuscript, it had gone from one private collector to another,” Fang said. “It had never seen the light of day. The only people to see it were Hollywood insiders, but the public has never seen it. It is a very strong, crypto-minded sensibility — decentralization, underdog story — to liberate it.”
 


Saqib’s path to liberate Jodorowsky’s bible began when he was a brown Muslim kid getting bullied in post-9/11 America. “I was the one who spent my time doing puzzles and reading books in recess while the other kids played,” he said. The Dune books draw much of their symbolism and world-building from Islamic and Middle Eastern cultures, something that Saqib said he identified with when he first read them.Saqib and his parents lived in Woodland, a suburb of Sacramento, where his father worked minimum-wage jobs in everything from fast food to construction. The family had painstakingly put together a tire business by the mid-2000s only to see it flounder in the 2008 recession. Advertisement  “Just when things were picking up, bankers decided to ruin the global economy,” he said. He was 12 years old at the time. In the long years of wage deflation that followed, Saqib found himself thinking deeply about “the system.” When he was 17, he wrote a change.org petition titled “Reforming fiat currency and the call for regulation of the Federal Reserve” addressed to Congress and the White House, and immersed himself in the world of online gaming, where many early cryptocurrency enthusiasts hung out. He bounced around California’s college system before dropping out, then did stints at emerging cryptocurrency businesses and investment companies, sometimes asking for payment in ether.“In February 2017, ether was like 12 bucks to the dollar,” Saqib said. “I liquidated to send $1,200 to my parents. That would be worth over $400,000 today.”Ether really started picking up toward the end of 2019 and has been on a rip ever since. Ether breached the $1,000 benchmark in January this year and stood at about $4,300 at the time this article was published. In March this year, Saqib cofounded a Bay Area gaming startup called Ex Populus. But Saqib’s dad still drove a truck at construction sites around Sacramento.“Dude, I don’t even own a house, I rent. I need to buy a house for my parents,” Saqib said in a rare moment of what sounded like doubt. He hadn’t yet told his parents that he had splashed out $3 million at a Christie’s auction. Advertisement  “I think I’ll tell my dad,” he said. “My mom — I don’t know if my mom will understand.”A week after this initial conversation, Saqib texted to say he had finally convinced his father to retire.
 


Now that they have won the bid, Saqib and his associates must make good on their promise to bring the bible to the people and prove that their fundraising approach was not just a gimmick.As things stand, Saqib still owns Jodorowsky’s bible but is in the process of transferring ownership to the DAO. Meanwhile, the copyrights for the bible’s contents are held by multiple artists and their estates. Jodorowsky is now 92 years old; Jean Giraud, or Moebius, the legendary French illustrator who did all the storyboards, died in 2012; H.R. Giger, who designed the creepy home planet of the House of Harkonnen, died two years later.“We can’t just scan it and put it on the internet,” Fang said. But by raising the money as a DAO, Fang said they hoped to show the various estates and stakeholders that there is a massive online interest in making the bible more accessible to the public. Advertisement  TheSpiceDao appears to have won over at least one influential skeptic. Last week, Pavich, the director of the Jodorowsky documentary, met Saqib while recording a podcast.“I went in there skeptical, like who is this guy who spent all this money on this book?” Pavich recalled. “Is he a hedge fund manager or something horrible?” But he said he was struck by Saqib’s youth, his humble roots, and his personal journey and has agreed to try to put him in touch with Jodorowsky himself.“To be 25 years old and to have figured out whatever he has figured out with this cryptocurrency and he’s not out buying Ferraris and, you know, being a moron,” Pavich said. “My impression of him is that he was coming from a very pure place.”For Saqib, Dune’s parable of the power of collective world-changing, decentralized action sounds a lot like the new promise of cryptocurrency and blockchain.“Dude,” Saqib said, “imagine if a generation of kids had grown up on Jodorowsky’s Dune instead of fucking Star Wars.” ● Advertisement

352,"Josh’s conviction is the latest fall from grace for the Duggars, who have spent the past two decades selling themselves as a wholesome family for others to emulate.","


In 2004, the Discovery Channel introduced America to a quirky family from Arkansas. While most families in the country have two children on average, a peppy narrator said, some families just keep “growing and growing.”“Ladies and gentlemen,” the narrator announced, “meet the Duggars.”At the time, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar had 14 children and one on the way. They were being featured in a one-hour documentary, 14 Children and Pregnant Again, which aimed to shed light on how such a large family handled logistics like chores, transportation, and parenting. Advertisement  In what would become their signature, the children introduced themselves to the camera one by one. At the beginning of the line stood Joshua — Josh for short — the family’s eldest. With a plaid blue shirt buttoned up to his neck and a clean-cut appearance, Josh was the crown jewel of the image his parents were trying to convey to the world: a wholesome, religious boy who could be an example of the lifestyle they believed was right.Things are very different now. In April, Josh, now 33, was arrested by US Marshals in Arkansas and charged with receiving and possessing child sex abuse images. During the trial, Homeland Security agent Gerald Faulkner testified that Josh had more than 200 images of children, some as young as 18 months, on his computer, describing some of the images as the “top five of the worst of the worst” he had ever seen. On Thursday, a jury in Fayetteville found him guilty of all charges.Josh’s conviction is the latest fall from grace for the Duggars, who have spent the past two decades selling themselves as a family for others to emulate. Their fame came about not by accident, as they have sometimes implied, but by design. Advertisement  Jim Bob and Michelle have been searching for the spotlight for years. As Jim Bob made a foray into politics in the late 1990s, serving in the Arkansas state legislature, Michelle worked on the family’s image, accepting Arkansas’s young mother of the year award in the early 2000s and writing an essay in Parents magazine about her unique life.When reality television producers came calling, the couple took it as an opportunity to not only improve the family finances, but also fulfill their ultimate goal: inspiring others to live like them.“Our desire in opening our home to the world has been to make Christ known and to share Bible principles that are the answers for life’s problems! We pray that everyone will find true hope in trusting Jesus Christ!” the family states on their blog.But in their quest for fame, fortune, and being a spiritual example for the world, the Duggars inadvertently ended up accomplishing the opposite. Their hubris made them oblivious to the reality that it was disingenuous to preach family values to the masses when they were harboring a predator.Because we now know that even before the first documentary aired, Jim Bob and Michelle were aware that they had a problem with Josh. Advertisement  
 


Looking back at the Duggars’ rise to fame, it’s hard to imagine why Jim Bob and Michelle chose to expose their family to the limelight, actively seeking more and more press, while dealing with such horrifying truths behind the scenes.During the trial, family friend Bobye Holt testified that the Duggars had known since 2003 — before the family’s first special on Discovery aired — that Josh had been sexually abusing young children.Holt told the court that the family had asked her and her husband, former Arkansas state legislator Jim Holt, to counsel their son as spiritual advisers, noting that Josh had been dating, or “courting” as the Duggars call it, their teenaged daughter at the time. In the meeting, then 15-year-old Josh admitted to touching four underaged girls on their breasts, vaginal areas, and under their clothes, she said. Advertisement  “He told us so our oldest daughter would know why the relationship had to end,” Holt said, fighting back tears, according to reporters.Holt didn’t name the victims, but the timing aligns with allegations, which were first revealed by In Touch Weekly in May 2015, of Josh sexually abusing his four younger sisters and another unnamed girl. After the magazine published its bombshell article, based on police reports it had obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests, the Duggars began a public relations campaign, giving an exclusive, two-part interview to Fox News’ Megyn Kelly, the first featuring Jim Bob and Michelle and the second featuring two of Josh’s sisters, Jessa Seewald and Jill Dillard. The sisters revealed that they were among Josh’s victims, but said they forgave him.Despite having known about Josh’s actions, the Duggars still chose to chase fame and exposure for their family, filming that first special in 2004 and following it up with several others. In October 2005, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that the family was filming two more Discovery specials, The Duggar Family: Raising our 16 Children and The Duggars' New Digs. Jim Bob, the paper reported, was also planning to run for state senate.According to Holt, during this time Josh continued to confess about what he had done, traveling to her home in Little Rock in 2005 to “get things off his mind.” During one visit, Holt testified that he admitted to penetrating the vagina of a 5-year-old girl with his finger. Advertisement  “You don’t forget something like that,” Holt said.Jim Bob and Michelle told Kelly in 2015 that after Josh confessed, they had taken him to Arkansas State Police Headquarters to disclose what he had done. After that, they said, they didn’t hear anything from the police for months.Meanwhile, the Duggars’ star continued to rise. They appeared on the Today show on Father’s Day 2005, during which the host declared they were “an inspiration to all of us.” When their 16th child, Johannah, was born that October, they made headlines across the nation. “Michelle Duggar just delivered her 16th child, and she's already thinking about doing it again,” crowed the Tallahassee Democrat. They continued to film television shows, like 2006’s On the Road With 16 Children and Raising 16 Children, among others.In 2006, though, someone tried to expose the Duggars’ secret. That year, an anonymous whistleblower mailed a letter to Oprah Winfrey’s production company, Harpo Productions, warning the studio of the allegations against Josh shortly before the family was scheduled to appear on the show.""You need to know the truth,"" it read. ""They are not what they seem to be.""The family never appeared on Oprah. The production company alerted authorities, who began a formal investigation and interviewed the five alleged victims. But since the three-year statute of limitations had run out, no charges were brought forth. Remarkably, the incident also remained largely under wraps, although, as Gawker reported in 2015, it eventually leaked onto the internet, where it became a persistent rumor on message boards about the show. Advertisement  The full details of the Oprah incident were not confirmed until Jim Bob and Michelle described it to Kelly in their 2015 interview. They told Kelly they felt like “failures” when they learned what Josh had done, but believed he had repented and forgave him. They also downplayed the severity of the abuse allegations. Jim Bob claimed none of the victims “really knew about this or understood what he had done until we told them,” and the family viewed the abuse as “something we would like to forget.” They also said they made “safeguards” to ensure their sons and daughters were not alone together after the investigation.After the Oprah incident, the Duggars continued to evangelize, seeking bigger and bigger platforms. In 2008, they got their own series on TLC, 17 Kids and Counting, which ran for eight years and 15 seasons. The first two seasons featured Josh’s courtship and marriage to Anna Keller, which served as a feather in the cap of Jim Bob and Michelle. Their oldest child had followed in their footsteps and entered a good Christian marriage.
 


In the episode “Josh Gets Engaged,” both parents extolled the good qualities of their eldest, conveniently leaving out the pain he had been causing the family for several years. Instead, they praised Josh and Anna for setting a good example of how young couples can remain pure before marriage and live their faith.“Saving that first kiss for your wedding day is like, really special,” Michelle said in the episode. “And I hope that it inspires others to consider that as well.”Over the next few years, the Duggars’ empire continued to grow. They added two to their brood, for a total of 19 children, and Josh and Anna had their first baby, Mackynzie, in 2009 (they now have seven children, including a newborn). Jim Bob and Michelle released books for parents, and the Duggar daughters released one for teenagers. The family went on the Christian speaker circuit and created a website where they could further share their beliefs.In a 2009 interview, Michelle discussed how the family viewed all of their media ventures: as a way to preach their faith. Advertisement  ""We feel like it's just an opportunity to encourage families to enjoy their children, enjoy children while they have them, and realize that they are a gift from God,"" she said. ""That's our prayer. This is an opportunity to just encourage others to value family and just enjoy the time you have with them.""
 


The Duggars couldn’t keep the skeletons hidden in their closets forever, though, and the past six years or so have seen the Christian empire they carefully constructed slowly crumble, culminating in Josh’s sentencing.The first blow came in 2015, when In Touch Weekly published the police reports from 2006 that revealed Josh had admitted to abusing five minor girls dating back to 2002. Afterward, Josh, then a 27-year-old married father of three, apologized for his actions but insisted they were in the past.""I sought forgiveness from those I had wronged and asked Christ to forgive me and come into my life,"" he wrote. ""I would do anything to go back to those teen years and take different actions.""
 


Soon after, Josh resigned from his position at the conservative lobbying organization the Family Research Council, and TLC announced they were canceling the show, now called 19 Kids and Counting. After the cancellation, the Duggars embarked on their spin campaign, starting with the Megyn Kelly interview, where the parents and daughters decried the release of the police reports. Jessa implied that the family was under attack for its faith.“I definitely feel like people that already don't really like our family would be the ones to really spread this around and maliciously do so, slanderously do so. Definitely, they didn't have the victims in mind,” she told Kelly.Soon after, TLC announced it would be keeping the Duggars on the air after all. The new show, Counting On, first started as a three-part special in December 2015 featuring Jessa and Jill’s lives as newlyweds, and over 11 seasons expanded to include the other married Duggar children and their spouses. While Josh did not appear on the show, Anna appeared sporadically.The Duggars picked up where they left off, continuing to preach their ministry, having their youngest daughters plus Mackynzie release a Christian worship album and making more attempts at entering local politics. There were cracks under the surface, most notably Jill and her husband, Derick’s, estrangement from the family, but for the most part, the Duggars continued on their path. Their attitude seemed to imply that if the family could move on from Josh’s sins, the rest of us should as well. Advertisement  
 


But Josh’s arrest for child sexual abuse materials and subsequent conviction may finally have ruined the family’s reputation for good. After Josh’s arrest in April, TLC announced it would cancel Counting On. Most of the Duggars and their adult spouses have kept a low profile during the trial, barely posting on social media or posting about their faith. Earlier this week, Joy-Anna Forsyth, the fifth Duggar daughter, posted that she was studying the book of Job, about suffering.“Job went through so much suffering and yet he received the strength that God extended to him to endure,” she wrote. “Yes, Jesus. I will trust you.” Advertisement     The current state of the Duggars raises the question of why they started all of this in the first place. Why, when you have a child dealing with such darkness, would you sweep it under the rug and push your family into the spotlight? Why would you preach about chastity, family values, and remaining faithful when you know you have such skeletons in your closet? And why would the Duggar parents make their children so famous that when the news eventually came out, the entire world would know?It’s hard to answer these questions. But what is even more incredible, in light of the past two decades, is that Jim Bob and Michelle are still seeking more notoriety, or as they likely see it, more ways to evangelize.In November, seven months after Josh’s arrest and just days before his trial began, Jim Bob, with Michelle by his side, announced that he was running for Arkansas Senate in order to fight for the “foundational principles that have made our nation great,” which he said are “under threat like never before.”“Our family has been blessed by God in so many ways,” he wrote. “We’ve found His love and goodness to be our source of strength in both our most joyous occasions and our darkest moments. It’s important to us to give back and to help others in every way we can.” Advertisement     Clearly, Jim Bob and Michelle still think they have lessons to teach us. The only question is if there’s anyone left who will listen. ●

353,Vaccine hoarding by rich countries is a big problem. And it’s not the only obstacle to getting shots into arms across the African continent.,"


The Omicron variant may have finally done what months of anguished calls from African nations and global health specialists had so far struggled to achieve — opening the world’s eyes to the dangers of pushing more than a billion people to the back of the line, while rich nations hoard hundreds of millions of COVID vaccine doses.Omicron was first detected in Botswana and South Africa last month, although exactly where it originally emerged is still unclear. We also don’t yet know whether Omicron will cause devastating new waves of COVID across the globe — or fizzle out like some previous coronavirus variants that once topped the worry list. But health experts say that low rates of vaccination across much of Africa, where many countries have fully vaccinated less than 5% of their population, have created the conditions for new variants to emerge. Advertisement     If many more shots don’t get into arms quickly, Africa and the rest of the world can expect more new variants to pop up. “We’ve always known that would be the case,” Edwin Ikhuoria, Africa executive director for the One Campaign, an international nonprofit group that works to end poverty and preventable disease, told BuzzFeed News. “The longer this does not get to everyone, the more the virus will mutate.”“We will only prevent variants from emerging if we are able to protect all of the world’s population, not just the wealthy parts,” said Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, in comments released to the media after Omicron was discovered. “The world needs to work together to ensure equitable access to vaccines, now.”International failureMeeting this challenge means more than simply dumping unused vaccine doses at airports in African capitals. So far, the effectiveness of donated doses has been hampered by poor coordination and logistical challenges, including a failure of pledged doses to turn up at the times they were expected. Often, they have appeared with a few weeks of shelf life remaining — in some cases forcing African nations to return donated vaccines or even destroy doses that passed their expiration dates.“[T]he majority of the donations to-date have been ad hoc, provided with little notice and short shelf lives,” the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and COVAX, the global effort set up to ensure equitable vaccine distribution, said in a statement issued on Nov. 29. “This has made it extremely challenging for countries to plan vaccination campaigns.” Advertisement     
 


As these maps show, Africa lags way behind other continents in COVID vaccine rollout. About 44% of the world’s population has completed vaccination, while around 55% have had at least one vaccine dose. Across the entire continent of Africa, the figures are about 8% and 12% respectively. And these numbers mask huge disparities across African nations. While nearly a quarter of South Africans are fully vaccinated, the figure is less than 1% in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, and Burundi.
 


It wasn’t supposed to be like this. COVAX, led by Gavi, the WHO, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, was set up early in the pandemic. Its purpose was to accept financial donations to help poorer nations, and negotiate contracts with manufacturers to “guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world.”The idea was that rich nations would also order some of their vaccines through COVAX, giving it a powerful position in negotiating purchase agreements with manufacturers. That would maximize the bang from each buck donated and ensure that poorer countries didn’t get left behind in the scramble for COVID vaccines. Advertisement     But that lofty goal has fallen victim to vaccine nationalism, as rich countries struck their own deals with drug companies and hoarded vaccines — some ordering many more doses than they needed to cover their own populations.Under then-president Donald Trump, the US refused to take part in COVAX. And while the administration of President Joe Biden pledged $4 billion in February 2021, COVAX has failed to meet its targets. By mid-August, COVAX had delivered about 200 million vaccine doses across some 140 countries, rather than the 600 million it had planned.The biggest single blow for Africa came in April, when India halted vaccine exports as it struggled to vaccinate its own population in the face of a devastating wave of COVID driven by the Delta variant. That created a big problem, because the vast majority of the doses earmarked for Africa by COVAX were being made by the Serum Institute of India in Pune.“If Nigeria was producing vaccines and its people were dying, and there was a need to vaccinate our people, the Nigerian government would do exactly the same thing,” Ikhuoria, who is based in Abuja, that nation’s capital, told BuzzFeed News. He doesn’t fault the Indian authorities, and other advocates share that view. Instead, blame has focused on COVAX for relying so heavily on Indian manufacturing capacity. “That was bad planning,” he said.“India is a global vaccine powerhouse, the largest commercial supplier of routine vaccines to lower-income countries, and prior to this pandemic, the Serum Institute of India was the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world,” a Gavi spokesperson told BuzzFeed News by email, defending the decision. “It is impractical to consider that any solution aimed at maximizing global output as well as ensuring global equitable access would not take advantage of this capacity.”COVAX was also short of other options, as its negotiations with Pfizer to supply vaccines were faltering. And with financial donations lagging, COVAX relied heavily on funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation — which had worked closely with the Serum Institute of India on other vaccination campaigns. “I’m not sure that there would have been another way, because there wasn’t any other money,” Gian Gandhi, COVAX coordinator for UNICEF’s supply division, told Time in September. Advertisement     Meanwhile, some rich nations have chosen to give vaccine doses through agreements with individual countries. According to tracking by the Kaiser Family Foundation, so far 51% of US vaccine donations to other countries had been given directly, rather than through COVAX or other international bodies.This means that donations have been driven in part by donor nations’ foreign policy priorities rather than recipient countries’ needs. “It was unilateral. It was not within a system,” Ikhuoria said. Donations that sidestepped COVAX have also limited the body’s ability to drive down prices by negotiating directly with suppliers.Local difficultiesDifferences in African nations’ own planning and logistics have also played a part in the vast disparity in vaccine rollout across the continent. Rwanda started receiving doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from COVAX in early March, after formulating a plan to prioritize high-risk groups including healthcare workers and setting up a supply chain to deliver shots to hospitals across the country. Today, more than a quarter of the Rwandan population is fully vaccinated. But in neighboring Burundi, where the government initially denied that COVID was a major threat, stating that the nation had been protected by the “grace of God,” almost nobody has received a shot.Elsewhere, a combination of local obstacles and late-arriving donations have forced nations to return or destroy vaccine doses. In May, for instance, Malawi burned almost 20,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, part of a batch of 100,000 doses it had received in late March from the African Union, after it failed to distribute them before their expiration date. Meanwhile, the Democratic Republic of Congo was unable to use most of the 1.7 million doses it received from COVAX, passing them on to other countries to prevent them from going to waste. Its rollout was hampered by poor internal transport links making it hard to get doses to remote areas, plus a monthlong pause beginning in mid-March, when concerns were raised about the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine following reports of rare but severe blood clots.These examples highlight a need to provide support to address local obstacles to vaccine rollout. “One of the things we’ve been calling for is support in terms of the logistics as well,” Ikhuoria said.Some African nations have also faced problems with vaccine hesitancy. In part, this has been driven by the spread of false information. According to a report published by the Africa CDC in March this year, 45% of people surveyed across 15 African countries believed people in Africa were being used as guinea pigs in COVID vaccine trials, while a third believed vaccine trials in Africa had led to the deaths of children. For those who remember the carnage through the 1990s, when drug companies refused to lower prices on lifesaving AIDS drugs, distrust of the pharmaceutical industry runs deep. Advertisement     Mkhokheli Nyala, a doctor at the Mpilo Hospital in Bulawayo, told BuzzFeed News that one big obstacle in Zimbabwe is misinformation from local religious leaders — with some pastors calling COVID vaccines “satanic.”“There are a lot of twisted theologies that are going around,” said Agony Siwela, a Lutheran pastor in Bulawayo whose church is trying to combat vaccine conspiracy theories.Even people turning up to be vaccinated in Bulawayo’s central business district said they had been doubtful about getting the shots. “I'm getting my second jab, but like many I was reluctant because of reports about the side effects of the vaccine,” Mavis Lubimbi, a mother of three, told BuzzFeed News.Many Africans also still need to be convinced of the urgency of COVID vaccination — in part because the continent has yet to be hit by the high death rates seen in Europe, the Americas, and parts of Asia. (Africa’s cumulative death rate from COVID is around 16 per 100,000 people, compared to almost 240 per 100,000 in the US.) In the Africa CDC survey, 54% of Nigerians said that they thought the threat from the coronavirus was exaggerated.“We’re not dying like flies,” Ikhuoria of the One Campaign said. “People moved on, they went about their lives normally.” He suggested that economic arguments should be stressed more strongly, given the hit taken by many African countries as the pandemic cratered their tourism industries.What needs to changeAs vaccination in rich nations has slowed, and India has finally resumed exports, vaccine donations have now started to flow. “In the last two months alone, COVAX shipped more doses than in the first eight months of this year combined,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a USAID ministerial meeting on COVID-19 on Dec. 6. More than 600 million doses had now been distributed by COVAX worldwide, he said.But problems still remain, including tensions over moves by many rich countries to prioritize vaccine boosters for their own people, while most people in Africa have yet to receive their first dose. Meanwhile, the WHO chief told the Dec. 6 USAID meeting that the ACT Accelerator, the effort to provide diagnostic tests, treatments, protective equipment, and vaccines of which COVAX is a part, was “out of cash” and needed $23.4 billion over the next 12 months to get these essential supplies “where they are needed most.” Advertisement     Building up vaccine manufacturing capacity in Africa would reduce the continent’s reliance on rich nations. “This would obviate the need for donations and liberalize the vaccine market,” Mark Seidner, an infectious disease specialist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and a visiting professor at Mbarara University of Science and Technology in Uganda, told BuzzFeed News by email.In September, the WHO announced the creation of a technology transfer hub in South Africa to teach manufacturers how to make mRNA vaccines like those from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. These vaccines are not only more effective than many of the doses distributed in Africa so far but can also be mass-produced efficiently and if necessary tweaked quickly to respond to emerging virus variants.But it is unclear when the first African mRNA vaccines will be made. “It depends on several factors, including funding, a willingness to transfer technologies and the ability of local institutions to absorb knowledge,” the WHO said in announcing the hub.“Failure to transfer vaccine technology is a major factor in the world’s failure to meet global vaccination targets and leaves the world far too vulnerable to vaccine-escape variants,” Tom Frieden, a former director of the CDC and president of Resolve to Save Lives, told BuzzFeed News by email. “The WHO’s hub is an important step, but short of receiving tech transfer right away from mRNA originators, this hub is unlikely to provide vaccine doses for months if not years.”In the meantime, African nations will need to develop plans to ensure that people at the highest risk are prioritized for vaccination with donated doses, Bruce Gellin, chief of global public health strategy with the Rockefeller Foundation, told BuzzFeed News. That includes people with HIV — about two-thirds of the world’s people living with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa. In the US, people with compromised immune systems have been prioritized for COVID vaccination. And studies in South Africa have found that people with HIV, who comprise almost 20% of the population aged 15 to 49, are more likely to become seriously ill or die from COVID.People who are immunocompromised are also more likely to become chronically infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, which increases the risk of viral mutation. Indeed, one leading theory for the emergence of Omicron is that it emerged in an immunocompromised patient in Africa — possibly someone with HIV. Advertisement     If Omicron isn’t to be followed by further threatening variants, the world needs to address the gross inequity that has characterized the international vaccine rollout so far, health experts say. And that means recognizing that we’re all in this together, rich nations and poorer nations alike.“The virus doesn’t know what country it’s in,” Gellin said.

Tervis insulated tumblers — $34.99 for a four-pack at Amazon2021 was the year I accepted that I needed some kid-friendly plastic drinking glasses for adults. They keep cold drinks cold for an impressively long time — I’ll leave an iced coffee out and find it two hours later with ice cubes still intact. Best of all, the insulation means no condensation sweat to leave rings on wood tables. They’re not the chicest-looking drinkware, but they’re perfect for daily use. —Katie Notopoulos Advertisement  
 


Casio travel alarm clock — $13.95 at AmazonI recently full-on slept through my phone alarm, which was...concerning. Though it did not totally fuck me over on that particular day, it was a wake-up call (lol) that my iPhone cannot be trusted as the sole thing to get me out of bed on time. I purchased a tiny, real alarm clock, and you should, too. It has performed its job of waking me up on time without incident, with the added benefit of not having the very first experience of the day be a blast in the face of the inevitable bad vibes of my phone. Plus, it's cute! —Addy Baird
 


A daily NYT crossword puzzle calendar — $14 at AmazonI refuse to look at my phone’s Screen Time, but I’m sure that in 2020 I spent at least 80% of my waking hours looking at my phone or laptop. I knew it was hurting my eyes and brain, but I struggled during quarantine to find a hobby I enjoyed that took me completely offline. At the end of that year, I bought a crossword puzzle calendar to give myself a daily task (I’m bad at hobbies so hobbies must be tasks) for 2021 that could take anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours to complete. I set myself rules to make it feel even more like an accomplishment (again I am not saying this is the right way to do things): I never google clues, but I can phone a friend. I can’t rip off a day until I’ve finished it (except for the times when I got behind by a week...catching up on that is too much pressure so I just rip seven days off in a chunk like they never happened). The compact page-a-day calendar was easy to take on trips to the woods where my friends would offer to help with the puzzle and then immediately get frustrated that they didn't know which seven-time Emmy winner a clue could possibly be referring to (Ed Asner). Patience is key with crosswords, and the joy of it isn't fun for the whole family, but rather a peaceful, solitary task that doesn't involve looking at my freaking phone. —Sarah Schweppe
 


LoveSac — $1,062–$1317.50 (on sale) at LoveSacA defining image of the pandemic for me is our 60-pound “puppy” cannonballing my unsuspecting daughter as she relaxed in the mountainous LoveSac that now sits, like a befurred and cuddly Jabba the Hutt in our family room. (LoveSac loaned BuzzFeed this item to review.) It’s difficult to describe just how comfortable and how much fun this thing is. Imagine sitting in a bathtub full of fur or a vast kangaroo pouch. Now, imagine doing it with another person. And now add a dog. The big caveat here is that you really need to have a good appreciation for the ridiculous to live with one of the larger LoveSacs as they are Raiders of the Lost Ark boulder–size, but wow, what a wonderful thing to watch movies from. —John Paczkowski
 


The Citizenry linen sheet set — $230 at The CitizenryYears ago when the direct-to-consumer bedding marker first emerged I bought a set of Parachute linen sheets. I remember being thrilled with them at the time, but they lost their color within a year and ripped soon after. So earlier this year we bought some new linen sheets from The Citizenry. I don’t often use the word lovely, but these sheets demand it. They are lovely, deliciously comfortable, and have withstood repeated washings inspired by a strong desire to ALWAYS have them on our bed, which is where I’m writing this because why not? —John Paczkowski
 


Nugget play couch — $259 at NuggetIn fall 2020, I wrote about how hard-to-buy Nugget play couches had become like Supreme drops for moms. The foam couch had grown a cult following through Facebook parent groups as a fun, fort-buildable couch that kids could climb on while doubling as playroom furniture that came in an Instagram-worthy array of colors. The pandemic created a surge in demand and a slowdown in production, resulting in a “drop” system where restocks would sell out within minutes. After publishing my article, I decided to buy one myself. Advertisement  My verdict: It’s absolutely worth the hype. My kid loves climbing and jumping on it, and the best endorsement I can offer any parent is that after an early evening session of Nugget play, he will conk right out at bedtime.There are now plenty of competitors to the Nugget couch, but a lot of them are way more expensive. Though colors are still limited, it’s possible to actually order one now. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Betta fish tank and supplies — tank, $27.99; filters, $8.49; and water conditioner, $2.49 at Amazon; betta fish, ~$5 at your local storeI absolutely did not want a fish. My son had been begging for a fish for months (downgraded from a dog at least), and I relented last January in a moment of pandemic-induced guilt. He couldn't have playdates with real children, but maybe he could have a fish companion. I dreaded cleaning the gross bowl, remembering to feed him, and having to explain his inevitable death to a small child. Advertisement  Turns out I was wrong. I love Swimmy, the blue betta fish. After a short-lived period of my son feeding him a single pellet in the morning and evening, I’ve taken over his feeding duties, and I enjoy it. I talk to Swimmy, greeting him in the morning and evening. I find the light in his tank a helpful nightlight in the kitchen — the one light that stays on, and his tank is even kind of attractive.Best of all, cleaning his tank is easier than I thought it would be. Instead of dumping all the water out weekly, you replace about a third of the tank every three to five days, while the fish stays in the tank (I just scoop it out with a measuring cup). —Katie Notopoulos
 


Hummingbird feeder — $25 at AmazonHummingbirds are assholes. (OK, just some hummingbirds are assholes. But they’re all adorable!) This I learned after hanging my first-ever hummingbird feeder, daring to hope that it would attract the eponymous visitors. (After being cooped up in a gloomy one-bedroom apartment for a year and a half during the pandemic, we finally moved this summer to a sunny place with a yard.)It didn’t take long — within hours, a colorful lil’ cutie was slurping up nectar (1 part sugar, 4 parts water, easy-peasy) and buzzing around the patio. News spread quickly and a number of their friends popped by — only to be chased away by the aforementioned asshole, who perched near the feeder and spent the whole day scaring off the competition (with a clicking noise we originally thought signaled an electrical problem). I decided I needed another feeder placed far enough away to satisfy other customers.Two feeders became four, four became six. For prime window viewing, I bought a couple of tall shepherd’s hooks. Now we (and our cats) can see the hummingbirds (most of whom are not assholes) from nearly every room in the house. Often when I’m outside replacing a feeder (every four to five days), a hummingbird will buzz around my head like I’m Snow White. Because of these tiny, extraordinary creatures, I experience joy — however fleeting — every single day. Even in 2021! Advertisement  I’ve got Amazon open in another tab, and I’m about to hit “buy now” on my seventh feeder. Can you blame me? —Dru Moorhouse
 


Outward Hound Invincibles stuffingless squeaky dog toy — $14 at AmazonBy the time our new ""puppy"" was 7 months old, he weighed 80 pounds and had probably destroyed his own weight in dog toys. We very quickly lost count of the ""indestructible"" plushies that were disemboweled and drawn and quartered in the one-puppy Battle of Helm's Deep that has been raging in our living room for months now. Only one toy has survived: an Outward Hound Invincibles snake. While he's been desqueaked, brutalized, and used to tow me around in an office chair, Severus Snake, as we call him, endures. He may well be immortal. —John Paczkowski
 


Just fill a sock with catnip, folksThis is Sir Jiggery Pokery, love of my life and the best decision I ever made. He is named after Antonin Scalia’s colorful dissent in King v. Burwell. (Scalia was a hilarious writer, as long as he was in dissent.) But Jiggers, bless him, has no love for cat toys. If it was made for cats, he is not interested in it, because, well, that’s how being a cat works.But he is not impervious to the chemical weaknesses of his kind. At some point during the pandemic, I got a big tub of catnip, took an unmatched sock, shoveled about a cup of the catnip into it, and tied off the top. Jigs promptly took the sock and wrapped it around his head, flailing about in the most feline of highs.Later that evening, he was running around the kitchen diving into empty Whole Foods bags, as one does, and he managed to get the handle of one stuck around his neck. Alarmed, he leapt into the air and ripped the bag in two. He then sprinted across the house, up the stairs, and under the bed, with half the paper bag flying behind him like a superhero cape. Advertisement     Anyway: Get a cat; they are one of life’s great delights. Then get a big tub of catnip and get him real high. —Emily Baker-White
 


Husky workbench as standing desk — $299 at Home DepotAfter 16 months of the pandemic, I figured it would be a good idea to get a desk for my apartment that would not also come with physical therapy for my body. I wanted an adjustable standing desk, but not something that cost $800+ or looked really stupid. I was lucky enough to have been tipped off to a secret: Workbenches sold by Home Depot intended for, I don't know, workbench stuff, actually make for perfect and cheap standing desks. This one is great — it looks fine, it comes on wheels if I need to clear space, it has a cool hand crank that's easy to use. And, best of all, it says “Husky” on it in big letters with a wolf head decal, which makes me feel very powerful while I stare at Tweetdeck. —Matt BermanOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News
"
355,Federal investigation records obtained by BuzzFeed News show how one of the most pivotal mistakes of the pandemic fell on an overburdened CDC lab with only three full-time employees.,"


In late February 2020, nine lab officials at the CDC gathered around a whiteboard to show an FDA expert how they had made the nation’s first coronavirus test — and to try to figure out why it failed.Earlier that month, the CDC had sent thousands of faulty tests to 48 public health labs nationwide, hoping to quickly catch the first cases of COVID-19 in the US. Instead, the country succumbed to an uncontrolled spread of the new virus, without tests ready to track the outbreak. It was the opening failure of the US government's botched pandemic response, which had atrocious consequences: Hundreds of thousands of people died, millions suffered, businesses shuttered, and worthless hyperpolarized information filled the void.Scribbled on the whiteboard that February day was the layout of the tiny CDC lab faced with the monumental task of making the country’s first coronavirus test. Officials mapped where experiments were conducted and where people were flowing in and out. With the FDA expert looking on, some reached a damning conclusion: The lab was the perfect stage for contaminating the tests. Advertisement  “Everyone had a lightbulb going off, that this is really bad,” Department of Health and Human Services lawyers wrote in an investigation completed in June 2020 and obtained by BuzzFeed News through a public records request. The cache of typed and handwritten notes, the lawyers noted, were not verbatim quotes but instead the “mental impressions” from the investigators and people they interviewed.“People can come in doors and go,” one investigator wrote.“No regulation of people through the lab.”“Multiple sources [of] potential contamination.”The US Department of Health and Human Services released a three-page summary of the investigation the same month it was completed. The full investigation documents include about 50 pages of interviews conducted by two lawyers with the HHS Office of the General Counsel, stamped “Attorney-Client Privileged,” which the health agency’s public records office sent to BuzzFeed News. An HHS official later claimed the documents were “inadvertently released” and asked BuzzFeed News to delete them, calling five minutes after an agency spokesperson turned down a request to comment on the interviews.This investigation, based on the documents and interviews with health officials knowledgeable about the test’s development, reveals:Government dysfunction. Congress, CDC leadership, and past presidential administrations have neglected labs at the world’s most highly regarded public health agency for decades. The small, underfunded Respiratory Virus Diagnostic (RVD) Lab was overburdened as COVID-19 blazed across the country.Questionable blame. The initial investigation summary criticized the RVD lab for the catastrophic failure of the nation’s first COVID test. But further documents and interviews call its conclusions into question, indicating a larger lab may have been the actual culprit — something HHS investigators failed to find.Cut corners. In the CDC’s rush to develop a lab test, officials chose to assemble two of its critical parts in the same facility, leading to cross-contamination that compromised the kits sent to state and city health agencies nationwide. This type of contamination happened before, during the 2012 MERS outbreak.Overconfidence. The CDC did not initially rely on tests already in use in other countries, because officials thought they could build a better one. Agency leaders did not coordinate with outside manufacturers for support, and they never performed any validations of previously developed tests that could have been used as backup.Systemic failures. The documents also reveal something even more damning: that the failures extended far beyond any one lab. The test’s problems, the documents show, are a symptom of much bigger mistakes — still unexamined — starting with the Trump administration's lack of a pandemic plan, lack of leadership and coordination at federal public health agencies, and widespread medical misjudgment in the early days of the pandemic that left the CDC holding the bag for everyone else’s failures.The test catastrophe documented by the HHS investigation has led to unprecedented demands from former federal science officials to overhaul the CDC in order to avert another such disaster. This is a move that would essentially transform the country’s public health system. There are even calls to take pandemic testing responsibilities away from the CDC: the Biden administration proposed a $65 billion (already scaled down to roughly $10 billion in public health spending in the “Build Back Better” bill) “mission control” office to handle future pandemics. And Harold Varmus, the Nobel Prize winner and former director of the National Institutes of Health, and John Holdren, a science adviser to the Obama administration, recently called for a “COVID-19 Commission,” similar to the 9/11 Commission, to investigate the US’s blunders during the pandemic. They want to start by investigating the CDC's COVID-19 test failure.The former director of the CDC, Tom Frieden, who reviewed the full investigation documents at BuzzFeed News’ request, said he was “kind of stunned” by the test failure. Under his tenure, in 2009, CDC rapidly developed a very successful test for the H1N1 flu pandemic, sending millions of test kits worldwide.“The fact is CDC has phenomenal laboratories, and they’re a treasure for the US and for the world,” Frieden said, “but they clearly need to up their game.”The investigation documents show that “now is the right time to ask broader questions about the future of the CDC,” said Scott Becker, chief executive officer of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, the group that alerted the CDC to the test’s problems last year.Benjamin Haynes, a spokesperson for the CDC, defended the agency in a statement to BuzzFeed News: “Since the rollout of the initial COVID-19 test, CDC has implemented corrective measures and remains dedicated to the highest quality laboratory science and safety.” The US Food and Drug Administration and HHS — the FDA and CDC’s parent organization — declined to comment on the record.As experts look to the CDC’s future, there’s much to learn from the past — especially from the early days of the pandemic, when a series of decisions at a tiny lab in Atlanta, strapped for funds and left to take on a Herculean task, would set the course for a global pandemic to hobble a global superpower.
 


December 30, 2019Warnings about the coronavirus spread worldwide when the ProMED alert system, an email service to identify emerging infectious disease threats, issued an initial report that described four people in China who had developed a “pneumonia of unknown cause.”The detection of a potentially novel virus sent health agencies worldwide scrambling to develop a test to identify infected people and stop its spread. The World Health Organization and South Korean firms quickly began designing one.In the US, the responsibility for developing a test fell to the CDC. The agency’s headquarters, a gated and secure facility, boasted one of the four highest biosafety-level laboratories in the US and about a dozen other buildings filled with labs, technicians, and scientists. The team tasked with developing the nation’s first test was in the tiny RVD lab, which included four smaller procedure rooms, all located on the seventh floor of Building 18 at the CDC headquarters. In January 2020, the RVD lab was staffed by nine people — only three of whom were full-time employees.
 


By Jan. 6, 2020, one of those full-time staffers, Xiaoyan Lu, an 18-year veteran microbiologist at the lab, was already discussing the design for a test with her boss and lab chief, Stephen Lindstrom. Three days later, a virus genome released by a consortium of Chinese scientists confirmed the unknown pneumonia was caused by a coronavirus, Lu’s specialty. Neither Lu nor Lindstrom would speak to BuzzFeed News on the record about the events described in this article or about their interviews with investigators.In the interview notes from the HHS investigation, however, Lindstrom described the development time for a CDC test as a “short fuse.” His supervisor, he said, ordered him to get FDA emergency authorization “as quickly as possible” so the test could be put to use.So Lu began to quickly design a test from scratch. To do so, she identified three key regions of the virus genome that it could catch. Two of these regions — called N1 and N2 — were specific to the new virus. The third stretch of genes, N3, was found in all SARS-like coronaviruses. The N3 piece was chosen partly because the team had to design the test before they actually had the genome for the new coronavirus in hand, and partly as a way to keep the test effective if the virus mutated rapidly, according to Lindstrom’s notes. Advertisement  On Jan. 10, the lab ordered large batches of chemicals to detect these three stretches of the virus’s genome in tested samples. These chemicals, or “reagents,” came from a much larger “core” lab at the CDC that manufactures compounds on demand for its more than 200 laboratories.Lindstrom’s lab got batches of the three reagents — matched to N1, N2, and N3 — on Monday, Jan. 13.But then there was a hang-up, according to Lu’s notes, with a vital fourth part of the test known as positive controls. These are copies of the part of the virus’s genes keyed to the three reagents. Every lab that gets a new test has to immediately mix the reagents with positive controls to prove that the tests can detect the virus. The copies of the virus's genes should link up with the reagents and always lead to a positive test result.Likewise, to prove that the test doesn’t cause false positives, labs hold a separate trial of the reagents mixed with distilled water. With no virus segments in that sample, that test should always yield a negative result. Advertisement  Test manufacturers usually don’t add positive controls to test kits until the final step before shipping, when everything else is freeze-dried or sealed away. That’s to avoid molecules of these viral gene bits sneaking into the reagents and contaminating them, which would cause false positives. It’s such a crucial step that some labs even manufacture positive controls at a separate site to make sure no such contamination can occur.At the respiratory virus lab, employees felt they didn’t have this luxury, according to Lu’s notes. They needed their positive controls to check their test worked — but Lu couldn’t get them from a commercial manufacturer for another 10 days. “Can I wait a week or 10 days? No, I can’t, we need this,” the notes from Lu’s interview read. The first possible US cases were likely already spreading from China, with the Chinese New Year holiday travel in full swing.So she asked the core lab to go ahead and make the positive controls along with the reagents. “We couldn’t get it anywhere else,” Lu’s interview notes say. And Lindstrom, according to her interview, told Lu he didn’t think that contamination would be a problem. But notes from Lindstrom’s interview disagree at this point, saying he only approved of the core lab making these early positive controls if that lab’s director were certain they could do it safely. People with knowledge of this conversation deny that Lindstrom had said he had no concerns about contamination.Because the core lab personnel knew of the contamination risk, they made the positive controls on separate machines and in separate workspaces. Each set of these early January positive control genes were made to match the test reagents — and they contained subtle, signature differences from the genes of the “wild” virus loose in the world. They delivered them to the respiratory virus lab the afternoon after Lu’s request, at 12:51 p.m. Eastern time on Jan. 14. Advertisement  
 


On Jan. 16, the World Health Organization published instructions from the German Center for Infection Research for its successful COVID test. Dozens of countries worldwide began to widely manufacture and distribute it.Why didn’t the CDC team follow suit? Lu, according to the interview notes, said that the health agency scientists thought they could make a better one. The CDC’s test mimicked the one it had made for MERS in 2012. “Our MERS assay performed better than WHO’s,” Lu recounted. And, she added, “We were racing against the clock.”But she also knew how crucial the positive control manufacturing step was, according to her interview. CDC’s test for MERS, while ultimately successful, was initially contaminated after the lab made the same risky choice: to manufacture the reagents and controls in the same location.A CDC employee familiar with the development of the test told BuzzFeed News that the health agency had also felt it would be better to have both US and German types of tests available worldwide — and that copying the WHO test would not have been politically possible under Donald Trump. “Imagine the backlash we would have had if CDC had said, ‘Hey, yeah, let’s use a German test,’” the CDC employee said.
 


January 17, 2020The director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Nancy Messonnier, held the agency’s first public briefing on the novel coronavirus. At the time, there had been just two known deaths worldwide and fewer than 50 cases, mostly in China. The majority of the cases, she said, were thought to be due to human contact with infected animals. “Based on the information that CDC has today, we believe the current risk from this virus to the general public is low,” Messonnier said.Nevertheless, the CDC was preparing for the worst by designing a national test for the virus. “We'll be distributing this test to state health departments,” she said.By Jan. 18, the RVD lab had a diagnostic test for the novel coronavirus up and running.But to manufacture and run all the tests, Lindstrom’s lab needed help. On Jan. 20, Messonnier “activated” its Emergency Operations Center at CDC to respond to the crisis and put a task force of senior officials in charge of the test kit’s manufacture. This sidelined RVD lab supervisors with coronavirus and respiratory disease expertise and replaced them with ones who had experience in flu and Zika virus outbreaks, the last large-scale global pandemics. Dozens of technicians borrowed from other CDC labs moved into the small RVD lab. For the first two weeks of developing the test, everyone in the RVD lab was in very close quarters before more space was opened up.According to his interview with the HHS investigators, Lindstrom had “moved over to respiratory viruses to have [a] quieter life.” He had previously managed the much larger test development team at the CDC flu lab, the one that produced the H1N1 test in 2009 in record time. Now, he was trying to recapitulate that success in a smaller lab with a much smaller team. Advertisement  Before January 2020, the budget for coronavirus preparedness was approximately $300,000, roughly 1/100th of the CDC budget for flu pandemic preparedness. Every year, the flu lab designs, leads, and organizes more than 1 million tests performed in public health labs nationwide. It analyzes the full genetic sequences of more than 7,000 flu samples, in support of a flu vaccination campaign; in the 2019 season, more than half the US population was inoculated.
 


The RVD lab was underfunded despite two recent coronavirus outbreaks, SARS and MERS, that killed hundreds of people and triggered worldwide alarm. Despite decades of pandemic preparations and planning by US government officials, the CDC had kept coronavirus testing contained in this one small lab, which was also dedicated to childhood respiratory diseases and colds. One of its neighbors, the gastrointestinal diseases lab, actually had more rooms. The RVD lab initially borrowed one small procedure room from that group to handle specimens early on in the pandemic. It was later taken back. Advertisement  “Steve didn’t have what he had in the flu [lab]: a system of people with knowledge, resources, staff appropriate for all stages of manufacturing qualifying design, while also doing diagnostic testing,” the investigator’s notes from Lindstrom’s interview said. Five or fewer people at the CDC were the only ones doing this for the novel coronavirus test. “Flu is very well funded, but ‘we’ are poorly funded,” Lu’s interview notes read.On Jan. 21 Messonnier announced that the first case of someone infected with the coronavirus had been discovered in the US. He was an American who had traveled in China and had alerted his doctor about his symptoms, which developed shortly after he returned home to Washington state. His doctor notified state health officials, who shipped the man’s nasal swab overnight to the CDC. Lindstrom’s lab tested it and notified them about the positive result the next day.“Right now, testing for this virus must take place at CDC, but in the coming weeks, we anticipate sharing these tests with domestic and international partners,” Messonnier added. By then it was clear the virus could be transmitted person-to-person. Advertisement  With his cobbled-together team now running diagnostic tests, Lindstrom needed to get the FDA’s emergency use authorization (EUA) in order to ship test kits to public health labs nationwide. Getting the EUA was a big hurdle, albeit significantly slimmed down from normal approval procedures. It required the core lab to send over the reagents for 600 test kits, while the CDC team double-checked that the test worked, according to the interview notes.
 


People worked nights and weekends, turning out 5 to 10 times more batches of reagents than normal at the core lab, according to the investigation notes. After two weeks, Lindstrom’s lab took over making positive controls, no longer needing the core lab’s early January positive control templates to prove the test worked.The CDC test was intended only as a tool for the public health agency to detect outbreaks, not to diagnose every sick person walking into an emergency room. Instead, in the early days of the pandemic, it became the only legal US test for every patient.That’s in part because no one else stepped up: Large test makers, burned before by past demands for unused and unsold Ebola and Zika virus tests, had no incentive to start making tests. And smaller academic and medical center labs were daunted by the paperwork requirements to validate tests: 240 pages’ worth of patient testing data. Underlying all this hesitancy was a widely held feeling that because earlier coronavirus outbreaks had not led to pandemics, this new coronavirus would also be limited. At that time, coronaviruses were considered deadly but not terrifically infectious, as a rule.The FDA EUA for distributing the test kits came amid the dawning realization at the end of January that the new coronavirus might spread without symptoms. By the time the CDC got the green light from the FDA on Feb. 4 to send out the test kits, China had reported more than 23,000 COVID-19 cases and over 400 deaths. By then, the city of Hong Kong was running 700 to 800 tests a day. The US had only reported 15 tests total, according to the Covid Tracking Project.
 


February 4, 2020Because there was such a short supply of tests, the CDC’s guidelines in February limited testing to travelers from China with symptoms, such as a cough or fever. These criteria were cooked up in January, when the coronavirus was still considered contagious only when people had symptoms and when the virus was not known to yet be in the US — both mistakes. That meant the CDC test newly authorized by the FDA was aimed at too small a pool of people to actually spot an outbreak.“We got the EUA 2/4,” Lindstrom said in his interview. “Shortly after released 400 kits for distribution.”Each kit contained enough tests for 800 people. Two days later, the test kits arrived at 48 public health labs nationwide. Before they could use the tests, the labs had to use the kit materials to verify that the tests actually worked. That required testing the reagents against both the positive controls (to see if that combination reliably produced a positive result) and against distilled water (to see if they produced a negative one).By the end of the week, Lindstrom’s lab got the numbers back. What they saw was alarming.“N3 failed to verify in 36 of 48 labs that tried,” his interview notes said. The water test was producing false positives 75% of the time. A few labs, notably labs in New York, also reported problems with the N1 reagent.The only tool the country had to spot and stop a COVID-19 outbreak didn’t work.
 


The CDC halted shipping of the tests over the weekend. The following Monday, Feb. 10, the agency held an emergency meeting among the three labs responsible for making the kits: the core lab, which manufactured the reagents, the RVD lab, which made full-gene positive controls and checked and assembled the reagents, and the Division of Scientific Resources lab, which packed everything together into test kits for shipping.The “working hypothesis” was that the core lab had been contaminated by producing both the reagents and the early January positive controls, requiring a “deep clean,” the interview with the core lab’s branch chief, Jan Pohl, said. Pohl did not respond to BuzzFeed News’ offer to him to review the interview notes.
 


Meanwhile, the CDC’s screwup was becoming one of the biggest news stories in the US, sparking widespread panic over the lack of tests. By this point, South Korea was conducting 15,000 tests a day. China’s labs had started distributing test kits almost a month earlier.At a Feb. 12 press briefing, Messonnier was peppered with questions about the troubled tests. “During a response like this, we know things may not always go as smoothly as we would like,” she said. “Of course, I hoped that this week every state — and every state did receive a kit — every state would be up and running.”By the end of the week, only nine state or city labs could verify that the tests worked and start running them. New York state, which would soon be the site of a deadly surge in New Rochelle, was not among them.A “deep clean” of two core lab rooms happened over the Presidents Day weekend, on Feb. 16 and 17 — a painstaking process where engineers take equipment apart and individually sterilize parts before reassembling them. ”It was important for our purification,” the interview notes read. Advertisement     
 


February 21, 2020Days after the deep clean, FDA microbiologist Timothy Stenzel was ordered to fly to Atlanta to determine why the test was failing. He landed on Saturday afternoon and drove straight to the CDC’s headquarters — where he couldn’t get past security guards at the biosecure campus because it was a weekend. Advertisement     His complaints were fielded all the way up to CDC Director Robert Redfield. Stenzel was finally let in for a tour of the RVD lab on Sunday. Over the next three days, he toured the other labs, later complaining of “vague answers” to his questions. “No one person could walk Tim through the whole process and tell him what was done,” despite the task force of senior CDC officials supposedly being in charge, Stenzel said, according to the interview notes. The notes said that at a commercial facility, versus a public health lab, “there would have been an operational lead” overseeing the process. Stenzel declined a request to speak on the record.In those interviews, however, Stenzel reported the core lab and distribution lab appeared very clean, but the respiratory virus lab appeared “messy,” more like a research lab than a medical one — which, in fairness, is what it was. At the end of the visit, on Feb. 25, Stenzel gathered members of the three labs together to talk through what went wrong with the test. Several people pointed to the respiratory virus lab as the possible culprit, suggesting that specimens sent there early in the test’s development were contaminating the reagents.Lindstrom was in the “hot seat” at the meeting, according to an investigator interview with CDC Division of Scientific Resources quality manager Heather Hughes. In a phone call, Hughes told BuzzFeed News she had been told not to speak to reporters by the CDC’s press office. Advertisement     As Lindstrom described the respiratory lab’s workflow on a whiteboard, the “lightbulb” moment came, according to Stenzel: The RVD lab had handled virus samples and positive controls in its main room. That may have contaminated the N1 and N3 reagents handled in nearby smaller rooms as lab personnel moved around.Normally, in order to prevent this kind of contamination, technicians handling samples need to be separated from those doing quality control on tests. Foot traffic should be one way only to prevent people from accidentally contaminating each other by contact or through the air. Under pressure and with limited space, that wasn’t happening at Lindstrom’s lab, according to Stenzel’s interview notes. Contamination under these conditions could have fouled both the N3 and N1 reagents.Every point of this scenario — from the viral samples being opened in a common area to people tramping from contaminated areas into clean procedure rooms — is disputed by three CDC personnel familiar with the test’s development who were interviewed by BuzzFeed News. They asked not to be named, citing fear of professional retaliation by CDC.While the core lab facilities were being cleaned and government officials were debating the source of the contamination, things were moving fast in the outside world: By the end of his visit on Feb. 25, Stenzel urged CDC leaders to move manufacturing of the coronavirus test kits out of their labs and over to a private manufacturer, according to his interview. The agency would make this move a week later. Advertisement     In a CDC briefing on that same day, Messonnier jolted the nation by warning that — with 2,700 COVID-19 deaths already being reported worldwide — outbreaks would inevitably shut down work and schools in the US.Facing what was now looking like an inescapable pandemic, the CDC’s unreliable three-part test was scrapped. On Feb. 26, the agency gave public health labs permission to nix the contaminated N3 component from tests they had already received, and it began sending out kits with only N1 and N2. The N1 reagents were no longer throwing off false positives by this point.
 


Other medical centers and academic labs across the country had also begun developing their own coronavirus tests, many looking for the N1 and N2 components like the CDC test. They had been clamoring for permission to run their own tests to speed results to doctors and meet surging demands.On Feb. 29, the FDA finally gave them permission to use their own tests. “We should have been permitted to do testing in January,” said Geoffrey Baird, a laboratory medicine expert at the University of Washington who reviewed the investigation notes for BuzzFeed News. “We weren’t. We were waiting and had this laboratory-developed test ready, like everyone else who knew anything about this, the week after the Chinese published the sequence.”That same day, Washington state officials reported the first suspected US death from COVID-19, a man in his 50s who had gone untested because he did not meet the CDC’s travel-based screening guidelines for the virus. They also reported the first large outbreak, diagnosed by non-CDC tests, at the Life Care Center nursing home of Kirkland, Washington. Ultimately, at least 43 residents died.“CDC should not be in the business of manufacturing test kits,” Baird said. The RVD lab team shouldn’t have been put in that precarious position in the first place, he added. “There should be a major test manufacturing company on standby.”The Kirkland deaths, coming just as the failure of the CDC test became clear to the public, spurred the Trump administration’s politicized response to the coronavirus.
 


Trump visited the CDC on March 6. Just a few hours before he’d arrived, the HHS investigators ended their three days of interviews with lab personnel. But with the cameras rolling at CDC, Trump falsely promised that “anybody that wants a test can get a test.”In reality, only about 2,000 tests were performed on that date. Meanwhile, the country fell into uncontrolled spread of the virus.AftermathEven before the investigation summary was made public, the botched tests cast a shadow over the CDC. By late spring of this year, Messonnier had retired from the health agency, and Lindstrom and other lab officials involved in the test’s rollout had moved into other positions. Messonnier, who now works at the Skoll Foundation, did not respond to a request to review and comment on the interview notes.On June 19, a summary report was publicly released concluding that the N3 component of the CDC test was likely contaminated at the RVD lab. “Time pressure” likely played a role, the brief said. The report did not delve into deeper questions of why the lab was so small to start with, why it was counted on to run diagnostic tests for the whole country in a burgeoning pandemic, or why other tests weren’t available when it failed. Advertisement     But an email that a lab official sent to CDC leadership just three days later called into question the central conclusion that the respiratory virus lab was to blame.The email, reviewed by BuzzFeed News, stated that the report contained false statements and that HHS investigators had received genetic test results showing that the real source of the contamination was the core lab positive controls — revealed by their distinct genetic signature. In this view, the “deep cleaning” of two core lab rooms washed the contamination out of the manufacturing process. That’s why the N1 region that had failed validation at some state public health labs ran clean enough to go back into tests by the end of the month.The investigation interviews mention that the polio lab at the CDC was running a genetic analysis of the contamination that briefly fouled up N1 reagents in March 2020. That contamination does not match the cloned coronavirus gene made by the RVD lab to serve as positive controls, BuzzFeed News learned from an internal email sent later by a CDC lab official. This is significant evidence to suggest the RVD lab wasn’t the source of the contamination — despite HHS saying it was.HHS and the CDC did not comment on the email or the allegation that the contamination may have involved the core lab. A CDC “root cause” analysis reported last year by NPR blamed the test’s failures on the RVD lab missing quality checks on kits sent out in February. A report on the test kits, led by the Division of Scientific Resources, is slotted for a scientific journal later this month. It will suggest that the N3 reagent may have suffered from a design failure rather than from contamination, according to a lab official. That’s despite its successful use in FDA-authorized tests by major commercial companies for the rest of the pandemic. Advertisement     In the aftermath of the test failure, and a critical Government Accountability Office report, the CDC has announced a series of “Lab Quality Improvement Activities,” requiring extra labs to validate tests inside and outside the agency before their release. The agency plans to ask the FDA to withdraw the initial test’s authorization at the end of the year and require all lab personnel to pass new accreditation exams by 2024.The CDC still hasn’t officially released its own explanation for what went wrong. A separate report from the HHS inspector general started in April 2020 but has yet to be finalized. That report, which is only looking at lab procedures at the CDC and will not determine the origin of any contamination, won’t be out until next year.The key will be making sure any changes at the CDC have lasting impacts. “A lot of money gets put in, then the emergency goes away, and people forget about it,” said Frieden, the former agency chief. “These are laboratories that need to work every day, year after year.” Advertisement     The fact that the CDC was the only group in the US responsible for making tests made the failure even more consequential, Baird said. But he argued that the wider lack of tests wasn’t the CDC’s fault. Instead, he blamed the FDA, which held on to a bureaucratic EUA process that stymied fast action in the face of a public health emergency. “There was a feeling this wasn’t going to be a major outbreak early on,” a CDC lab official told BuzzFeed News, saying that senior leaders didn’t do enough to encourage industrial test manufacturers to mobilize.An FDA official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, told BuzzFeed News that criticism of its EUA process is misplaced because the alternative would have been throwing the US’s doors open to a blizzard of shoddy tests in that first February of the pandemic. That would have showered doctors nationwide with false positive and negative test results in February 2020.Overall, the test problems were just a small part of the absence of a national strategy for dealing with a pandemic, the FDA official added. A plan for nationwide testing capability, for example, was launched at the start of the pandemic and “scrapped” by the Trump administration, former FDA chief Scott Gottlieb writes in his recent book, Uncontrolled Spread: Why COVID-19 Crushed Us and How We Can Defeat the Next Pandemic. Instead, the administration had no plan aside from sending testing supplies to states and pressuring the FDA to authorize more tests after the CDC test failed. Advertisement     The CDC’s test failure is a symptom of this wider pandemic failure across the entire government. There weren’t enough tests, but there also weren’t enough ventilators or personal protective equipment or swabs available nationwide.In the aftermath, the country is left with the question of how to make sure there isn’t a similar failure in the next pandemic. Many experts are suggesting the CDC – once considered the global ideal – either needs major changes or should play a significantly smaller role.“There is no other institution in the world that does as wide a variety of laboratory tests as CDC. And it does them under very difficult conditions, where you have huge time pressure, you have uncertainties,” Frieden said. “The fact that a problem like this could occur clearly indicates that you need additional structural reforms at CDC.”If the Biden administration’s plan to create a central pandemic office comes to fruition, the place to locate it is probably not the CDC, “where functions are bunkered inside rigid siloes,” Gottlieb writes in his book. “Going forward, we need to provide for a national-level capability to field and deploy clinical tests for a novel pathogen.” ● Advertisement

356,"A Theragun, sunscreen, headbands, and the Revlon One-Step made life a little nicer.","


2021 was stressful. No kidding. The staff here at BuzzFeed News have some recommendations for what they tried at home over the last year that they actually loved and helped make life a little easier. Things like a Theragun for sore muscles, fancy face wash, a cheap dupe for fancy sunscreen, and the best workout headband for short hair. Perhaps the strongest recommendation is that two separate people tried out and swear by acupressure mats for headaches and stress.These items were independently selected by staff and they spent their own money on it. Just so you know, BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them. Oh, and FYI — prices are accurate and items in stock as of the time of publication. Advertisement  
 


Acupressure mat — $19.47 from AmazonI get really bad headaches periodically and generally bounce between over-the-counter medications, none of which seem to make a dent in the pain. Earlier this year I asked a neighbor with migraines if he’d had any medication successes recently, and he said, “You know what has helped? This.” I expected the link would go to some newfangled headache medicine or perhaps an herbal remedy, but instead it went to this truly odd product, a yoga mat crossed with a medieval torture device rendered in crisp white plastic spikes Somewhat inexplicably, it does in fact seem to help my headaches, and it also causes me to fall into a weird deep sleep within moments of lying down on it. (Warning: Set an alarm; I recently conked out for two hours on this thing, and my back was aflame when I finally woke up.) I have found it comforting to know that when the pain gets bad, I can just lie down on my bed of piercing plastic nails. —Sam Henig Advertisement  
 


Theragun Prime — $299 at Macy’sYou know what I got into over the pandemic? Running. Really original, I know. But between the stress of the lockdown and the stress of being a new father, I needed a consistent and mindless physical release. Advertisement  You know what happens when you run regularly? Your whole lower body starts to hurt. I tend to be skeptical of shortcuts around pain. I don’t really think you can trick the body. And if you do, I think you tend to pay for it later. But a few months after I did my first loop around Prospect Park, wracked with calf and hip pain, I caved and ordered a Theragun. Yes, a Theragun. That loud and heavy percussive massager that looks like a sex toy for German ravers.The thing works. You stick it where it hurts and then it hurts less. Doesn’t get much simpler. There are lots of things I don’t like about it. It costs too much, and when I lie on the couch blasting the tension out of my quads, my wife will sometimes cruise by and ask, “Pleasuring yourself again?” To which I say, 20 miles a week may strain my knee, but words will never hurt me. —Joe Bernstein
 


Contoured sleep mask — $18.99 at AmazonLet me start by being really honest: I cannot function with less than eight hours of sleep. I know there are a lot of freaks out there who are proud to sleep like five hours a night or whatever, but I am not like you. Sleeping is my favorite — and incredibly vital!! — hobby, so you know you can trust me, and I'm here to tell you to get this contoured sleep mask made of memory foam. It has changed my sleeping life in a way no other product ever has. The second night I used it, I slept straight through my alarm and got a full 12 hours of deep sleep, which was terrifying for the purposes of my alarm’s quality, but fantastic for my mind and body. It's pitch-black in there, but the contouring means you can open your eyes even in the mask, plus you can keep the blinds open and let the sunshine in to help you wake up once you take it off — but not a moment earlier. I also find the soft memory foam to be sort of like an extra pillow just for my eyes, and the act of putting it on when it's time to sleep keeps me off my phone and tells my brain it's time to shut shit down. I love her. —Addy Baird
 


La Prairie foam cleanser — $90 at Neiman MarcusA few years back, a Very Nice person gifted me with some travel-size products from a Swiss company called La Prairie. I knew nothing about the brand. They seemed nice. A small tub of something called skin caviar, a refining lotion, and the one standout: a tiny tube of foaming face cleanser. It smelled great — a faint hint of peppermint, maybe? (It’s pink, so maybe my brain filled in that scent on its own.) It was unlike any cleanser I had used before. It rinsed away in seconds (no soapy feel) and left my face feeling weirdly super clean. I have dry skin, and it never felt like this particular product was drying it out more — rather, it was the opposite. Really, it wasn’t like any other facial cleansing product I’ve tried (and I’ve tried lots). I only needed a tiny bit, and it lasted forever. When I ran out of all these cute little products, I had a bit of a shock. This stuff is expensive! As in, some of the products are $200-an-ounce expensive. (Ahem, $180 sunscreen, anyone?) Anyway, I was like, Welp that’s nice, now where’s my favorite Neutrogena cleansing gel? (It’s also a great product.) However, this year I found the La Prairie foam cleanser for $90. I know, that’s a LOT for a face wash. But it’s a 4-oz. tube (which, BTW, is huge by beauty product standards), and it’s lasted for months — it may even last a year. I don’t generally spend that much on beauty products, but this is the rare item that seemed like it would be OK for a fancyish gift or an occasional splurge. [Editor’s note: We found this for cheaper on Amazon, but the reviews for the seller said that it may be expired or counterfeit, which is not uncommon for high-end skincare products on Amazon or other reseller sites.] —Theresa Tamkins
 


Acure Curiously Clarifying Shampoo — $5.99 at AmazonI have combination hair and exercise a lot, so finding the perfect shampoo has been a lifelong journey. Acure is affordable, smells great, has a vegan formula, never dries out my scalp, and has kept my hair feeling shiny from my roots to my tips! —Nicole Fallert
 


Revlon One-Step Dryer Brush — $34.88 on AmazonIt takes less than 10 minutes for me to dry my long, thick hair with this dryer brush. It doesn't dry out my hair or scalp — and is loved by many of my friends with different hair types from curly to straight. —Nicole Fallert
 


Larq self-cleaning water bottle — $95 at LarqI don’t know about you but I am really bad about washing my water bottle. Frankly, it just doesn’t cross my mind often enough, and then I realize it’s gross and I’m embarrassed and avoid dealing with it. This is probably something I should address in therapy, but until then, there’s the Larq self-cleaning water bottle. Yes, $95 is a ridiculously high price for a water bottle — but if there were a water bottle worth such a price tag, it would be this one. Not only does this thing clean itself with a UV light inside the lid, but it is also able to filter water (with two different settings based on how much filtering the water might need). And thanks to some sort of god-tier insulation, it keeps my water cold as hell. My previous main water bottle was a giant 42-oz. Hydroflask, which was literally giving me shoulder problems from carrying it around. The Larq bottle is 17 oz., which means I’m filling it up often but also that it fits perfectly in my bag. —Addy Baird
 


Intake Breathing nose magnets — $67 from Intake BreathingI have a garbage septum that has robbed me of clear and easy breathing for decades. It interferes with my sleep, makes exercising annoying, and on occasion humiliates me in meetings or public gatherings when I suddenly realize I have unconsciously begun pulling on my cheek to stretch open a nostril. It sucks. And, yes, I should have it fixed surgically. But instead of doing that, I have relied on a bucket full of pharmacy-shelf flop-nostril countermeasures. Breathe Right's little nose strips, nostril dilators, I’ve tried them all. They have all helped to some extent, but none have given me the throw-the-windows-wide nostril opening relief of Intake Breathing’s nose magnets. These things improve on the concept of nasal strips by turning them into an inflexible and *magnetized* nose bridge that then attaches to little metal-filled bandage-y things you stick on your nostrils. Ridiculous, you say? Ridiculously ingenious. Because they are not flimsy, and they rely on the POWER of magnetism instead of the power of adhesive athletic tape, Intake opens up your airways and keeps them that way without falling off your face. Yes, I look like I have a Transformer on my nose when I'm wearing it. But I can breathe without feeling like I’m suffocating, and that’s all that matters. —John Paczkowski
 


Shakti Mat — $69 at ShaktiThe Shakti Mat is a modern-day bed of nails. It is a deeply weird synergy of BDSM and meditation — but once you get over the initial pain, it is incredibly relaxing. I have no idea how or why it works. But it was definitely more fun than the pandemic. —Tom Warren
 


Innisfree SPF 36 daily sunscreen — $15 at AmazonI’m old enough to have observed the frightening reality of sun damage and have been scared straight into assiduous sunscreen application. I previously tried and liked Supergoop’s “Play” everyday SPF 50 sunscreen, but at $22 it’s kind of pricey. So I looked for some cheaper options, and the closest dupe for Supergood was from K-beauty brand Innisfree for $15. It has the same texture that is moisturizing and light, “dewy” without being sticky. I have dry skin, and I don’t love the matte finish that La Roche-Posay, Neutrogena, and Sun Bum’s face options have. —Katie Notopoulos Advertisement  
 


Harry’s deodorant — $5 at Harry’sDo you sweat more than you’d like? Profusely, perhaps? Are you tired of spending $12-plus on “clinical-strength” over-the-counter antiperspirants that smell like your grandmother? Then check out Harry’s sweat control solutions. The company, which started out as a subscription shaving outfit, now makes a line of delightful deodorants. The scents are interesting and not at all cloying (goodbye “baby powder,” hello “stone” and “redwood”), the “enhanced sweat control” version works just as well as anything you’d buy from BIG DEODORANT, and it only costs $5. —John Paczkowski
 


Temple Tape sweatband – $8.95 and Temple TapeLike so many other people over the last year and change, my hair grew out a lot. Like, *a lot.* But when it came time to reenter society and get a haircut, I wanted to keep some of the volume I had picked up over lockdown. My new barber made it happen (Masako, you’re seriously the best) but three weeks after any cut, it’d run into a problem. My longer hair would start getting in the way at the gym or on a run. Some buffs I had on hand before the pandemic worked fine when I was home, but I didn’t want to be wearing some handout covered in corporate logos all the time. Enter Temple Tape headbands, which I found while looking for a headband brand I could order outside of Amazon. They’re durable, keep my hair up and sweat out of my eyes, and come in a bunch of simple colors. They’re even based in Brooklyn so I get to say I’m supporting a local business.I feel like headbands are having a moment. They’re ubiquitous on college and pro football sidelines and even Drake sported one while boxing. The appeal is easy to understand. They’re functional, but they’re also so fun to wear that I have a headband on during all my workouts now, even if I got my hair cut the day before. —Eric MorrowOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

358,"Cori Bush set out to make Congress more reflective of activism outside Washington. But in an institution with hierarchical power structures, how much say does she have?","


ST. LOUIS — Before she was in Congress, Cori Bush was a registered nurse. And because she was a nurse, in uniform, she says she was the one who was called over — Cori! Cori! — when a newborn got tossed out of a car at the feet of protesters a few years ago at a march for racial justice in Ferguson, Missouri. Bush says she tucked the baby under her arm like a football and ran behind a building where she checked on it.Sometimes, you are put in a position where you are in the right place at the right time to save a life. “But you can choose to not. That’s a choice. And so that’s how I approach every single day, as a choice,” Bush says as she recalls the incident. “People are hurting every single moment, every single day, and we know this. So it’s a choice to actually go and do the work.”Bush is only about one year into her first term and is already one of the highest-profile progressives in the House of Representatives. If you saw the 2019 Netflix documentary Knock Down the House, which captured Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s winning campaign against a powerful Democratic incumbent, you also saw Bush’s losing 2018 primary challenge in the Midwest. If you heard of the lawmaker who camped out on the Capitol steps over the summer and was widely credited with winning an extension of the eviction moratorium, you’ve heard of Bush as she is today. Most recently, Bush was one of six House Democrats to vote against the infrastructure bill President Joe Biden signed into law on this month, withholding her vote not in objection to the bill, but in objection to the fact that Democrats had moved forward with it before the social programs bill progressives had been promised they would pass alongside it.Bush is determined not to fit in. Her office describes her as a “politivist,” someone who is both a politician and an activist, trying to change the system from within. She’s willing to criticize party leaders like Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and ridicule party moderates like Sen. Joe Manchin. She’s not in Congress to move up in leadership, she says, or hoard institutional power.But what power that leaves her with is uncertain. Progressives in Congress are in a precarious spot, trying to flex over Biden’s agenda while getting heat from constituents about symbolic votes and looking down the very real possibility of being a small slice of the House minority after next year’s elections. The tension between her role in Congress as she sees it and the realities of the institution, her party, and its leadership are palpable.“When I was on the ground protesting, it felt like we were teeing up these balls, and nobody was there to hit the ball out of the park. So now I’m like, OK, I know who tees up the balls, so I’m not going to push you all away,” Bush tells BuzzFeed News. “You keep teeing up these balls, and I’m in the position to hit them.”
 


Bush is sitting at a two-person table in Kingz Turkee Shack, a tiny restaurant tucked in a strip mall in her home city of St. Louis. She’s wearing a T-shirt from her freshly announced reelection campaign and sparkly, mid-calf lace-up boots, and she’s suggesting that a lot of the Democratic Party’s woes are self-inflicted between bites of a meal that includes a tantalizing turkey leg the size of something you’d find at a state fair.“If you’re not willing to fight for the things that we need, stalling or stifling things because of all of this incrementalism and old ways of thinking, that is what is hurting this party.”She’s diplomatic in the way that she talks about the forces within her party hurting progressives, not that she’s unwilling to name names. Earlier this month, she released a scathing statement on West Virginia’s Manchin, one of the two Democratic senators who’ve prevented the Build Back Better bill from being the sweeping social spending legislation progressives initially envisioned. She accused him of being “anti-Black, anti-child, anti-woman, and anti-immigrant.” (Asked if he’d ever responded to the statement, whether the two lawmakers had had conversations, or what their relationship was like, Manchin’s office said, “we don’t have anything to add.”) After the Build Back Better legislation passed the House last Friday, she tweeted, “Senator Manchin, we’re looking at you. The people must win.” Historically, the approach to winning people over in the halls of Congress has more often been trying to butter up the person you want on your side. Bush has little patience for that.
 


Bush also presents herself as being in natural conflict with her party’s leaders. If Pelosi were to decide to run to lead the Democratic caucus again after next year’s elections, Bush does not currently “have an answer” for whether she’d support her. A spokesperson for Pelosi told BuzzFeed News in response to questions that ""the Speaker is not on a shift, she’s on a mission.""“I don’t wear those same glasses that she wears,” Bush says of Pelosi. “For me, I’m not a woman first, I’m Black first. I don’t care about party lines the way that she does. I don’t care about looking like I’m leading, or care about being the one that is staying within — like, just playing the game.”The weekend of the House infrastructure vote, Pelosi flew back to San Francisco and officiated the ritzy wedding of Ivy Getty, an heir of the oil fortune. Asked what she made of it, Bush prefaces by saying that she “didn’t know who those people were until I saw people talking about it,” and she ends with saying Pelosi officiating “didn’t really move me either way.”“My purpose is to lift up those that have been marginalized and oppressed and overlooked. And she’s in a position of power, and that’s more her lane I guess. That’s where her focus is,” Bush says. “People see things differently than others, and I have learned to not condemn people for the way they see things when they haven’t gone through the things that I’ve gone through. Like I can’t change their experiences, the only thing that I can do is expose them to mine, or those of others that they may not know or understand.” Advertisement  
 


So much of Bush’s approach to politics ties back to her identity as a Black woman and as an activist. Issues around racial justice are not nearly prioritized enough in Congress, she says.Bush recognizes Biden hasn’t even been in office for a full year, but she thinks he has a lot of work to do, particularly in that area. She’s candid about how disappointing it was to her that police reform talks collapsed this year. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act was, in her words, “not the end-all, be-all, the greatest legislation for police reform that there’ll ever be,” and yet Congress couldn't even get that done. Advertisement  “He has to deliver a substantial win to the Black community as it relates to policing. He has to, because this is not even about just looking good, this is about saving lives,” she says. Bush hadn’t given thought to whether Biden should run for reelection, but says it would be up to him. Days after Bush's interview, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that Biden intends to run for reelection.If not him, “the question is, who else will run?” Bush says with a laugh.
 


Bush stands in front of a crowd in a black sequined blazer giving remarks to a group of her top supporters. Earlier in the day, she’d announced that she was running for reelection, and this is the kickoff event. The booze is flowing, her family is in the crowd, and much of St. Louis’s political who’s who had come by to indicate their support. Advertisement  “When they tell me, You shouldn’t say that because you hurt the Democrats. You shouldn’t say that because you hurt this thing or that thing. And I say, Well, you should’ve fixed it before I got there then,” Bush says to applause. “So don’t tell me how, what I should do now, because you’ve been there — OK.”She cuts herself off, to the delight of the audience, but the intention of the last part is clear: a while.She describes the day that the House moved forward with the infrastructure bill, but not a Build Back Better bill, as the “absolute worst day” she’s had in Congress so far. “I’m Black girl broken,” she’d texted St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones. “I was hurting because I couldn’t believe I did the right thing that way that I did,” she told an audience at the campaign event that Friday night, referring to her “no” vote. She told staff she wanted to be off social media and away from the news to take care of herself.“It’s probably very lonely for her to be someone that’s taking such a strong stand for our people,” Jones, who was invited to and attended the signing of the infrastructure bill at the White House, tells BuzzFeed News. “But she’ll tell anybody, she didn’t go to Congress to play or to be somebody. She went to Congress to do something.” Advertisement  But that can be difficult to square with constituents, some of whom have challenged her on decisions like her “no” vote on the bipartisan infrastructure bill. On a town hall call she hosted this month focused on the Build Back Better Act, one caller asked her what progressives would do to avoid the criticism that they were the ones obstructing Biden’s agenda with their “no” votes on infrastructure. Bush demurred, noting that she supported the bill but didn’t back it because she wanted to keep leverage for the social spending bill. Another caller felt that being so focused on Build Back Better instead of touting the infrastructure bill was hurting the Democratic Party.
 


“You even voted ‘no’ to pass the infrastructure bill, which is great, it’s going to help St. Louis. It’s going to help a whole lot of cities all over the nation. So why can’t we talk more about what’s in the infrastructure act and then still push for the Build Back Better?” Bush again reiterated her position that both were necessary, and that the focus on the social policy bill was because it was the one whose fate was more uncertain. Advertisement  Around Congress, Bush is known as part of the expanded version of the Squad of progressives pushing Democrats to go for bigger initiatives than political reality may always allow. Though they are reflective of the diversity within the party, voters have often rejected their ideas and preferences — from the presidential primary in 2020 to local issues like a recent ballot amendment in Minneapolis that was endorsed by Rep. Ilhan Omar, one of the Squad members, to replace the police department with a department of public safety. All of the Squad members represent Democratic districts; several, like Bush, knocked out incumbents to turn an already-Democratic district into something even more so, versus flipping a conservative or swing district. They are often used in Republican messaging to get a rise out of their base, and often those attacks are racist.
 


In inquiries for insights into Bush from other lawmakers, BuzzFeed News was told a couple of times by members or their offices that they didn’t know her very well, a reflection of the pandemic and her short time in Congress. And while Democrats acknowledge that there’s a changing of the guard happening within the party and are broadly complimentary of her activist approach, it can sometimes run up against the realities of Congress.“I’ve always been impressed with what she said, and I share a lot of her positions. The one thing about being that — what’s the best word? — seemingly uncompromising is that you don’t understand that in this body you never get 100% of what you want,” says Kentucky Rep. John Yarmuth, a House committee chair who is retiring at the end of this term. “If you get 80% of what you want, that’s more than most people will ever get.”“That’s the only problem I see with that kind of passionate commitment to positions. You gotta count on being frustrated.”
 


Bush can at times be exactly like other politicians. When you see her on the news or hear her on the radio, what she says is very intentional and thought out. She sometimes sidesteps issues, like on the town hall call. And though her own start in politics came protesting on the streets of Ferguson, and she has shared stories of her past that are hard to imagine coming from many lawmakers but that many Americans find relatable — her experience being unhoused; an abortion; what steel-toed police boots feel like as they press down on your body — her exposure to politics from a young age was unusual: Her father, Errol Bush, is a Northwoods alderman. Though she says she was reticent to enter politics herself because of this up-close seat to that sharp-elbowed world, she clearly ended up changing her mind.“People back home want something different, and this system has not been working, but until it’s completely changed, we have to still scream and make noise, and I think that’s what makes Cori unique,” says Missouri state Rep. Rasheen Aldridge, who met Bush while protesting in Ferguson in 2014. This approach to politics is becoming more common as younger, more diverse lawmakers enter office, some of whom, like Bush, survived a violent pro-Trump insurrection at the United States Capitol on their third day in office.She brings the insurrection up when asked whether she agrees with Ocasio-Cortez, who was recently targeted in an anime video tweeted by a Republican lawmaker, that “institutions don’t protect [women of color].” Bush does agree — the House, she says, has not done enough to protect members, especially when they take votes on hot-button issues. It’s not just Congress where women of color aren’t protected, but yes, it happens there too. Earlier this week, she called for the expulsion of House Republicans who were seeking to hire Kyle Rittenhouse, who was acquitted of all charges, as an intern, arguing that every day it felt more dangerous going to work. Advertisement  Bush says she understands that others “have not gone through our experiences” or “walked through what it’s like to be a woman of color” in America. They don’t experience “the vitriol and the hatred” the same way. The problem, she says, is “not just that you don’t understand it. It’s that we don’t see your interest in trying to.” ●

359,Instagram is still recommending pro-anorexia content to vulnerable users. But a new report shows its failure to protect users at risk of disordered eating is about more than just the algorithm.,"


When a young woman followed a “thinspiration” account on Instagram and used terms associated with disordered eating, Instagram’s recommendation engine quickly suggested she follow other “thinstagram” accounts, which often showed images of underweight bodies.Soon, the woman received unsolicited direct messages from a weight loss “coach,” an invitation to join a “pro-anorexia” (“pro-ana”) group chat, and requests from other users looking for “buddies” to hold them accountable to dangerous weight-loss goals. Advertisement     Luckily, in this case, the young woman wasn’t real. Her account was the creation of two technology watchdog groups, Reset Tech and the Tech Transparency Project (TTP), to show just how easy it is for users, including teens, to encounter content encouraging disordered eating and self-harm through Instagram’s recommendations, search, hashtags, and messaging functions.According to a report published Wednesday, the test account for the 29-year-old woman created six “thinspiration” posts, and followed a single influencer, Eugenia Cooney, who is popular in pro-ana circles online. (Cooney has more than 700,000 followers on Instagram, over 850,000 followers on TikTok, and more than 2 million followers on YouTube. She is verified on all three platforms.) A spokesperson for Instagram confirmed that Cooney’s account does not violate the company’s policies and is recommendable to all users. The spokesperson added that the account “is often used to share stories of recovery.” Cooney did not respond to a request for comment.Reset and TTP also created a second test account, representing a hypothetical 14-year-old girl. The account followed 100 pro-ana accounts, including users followed by the adult test account, as well as users recommended by Instagram. It also made six “thinspo” posts. Following these actions, the account received pro-ana recommendations in Instagram’s Explore tab, including multiple photos of emaciated women in their underwear.The report from Reset and TTP was released just hours before Instagram’s chief executive, Adam Mosseri, was scheduled to testify before a Senate committee about the app’s effects on young users. It was released just hours after Instagram announced changes to the content that can be recommended to teens on the app and previewed parental controls that it plans to launch next year. It follows a bombshell report by the Wall Street Journal, and testimony by whistleblower Frances Haugen, about how Instagram’s parent company Meta (née Facebook) ignored internal research about the platform’s dangerous effects on teen mental health. Advertisement     
 


But the report also comes at a moment when eating disorder prevalence among teens has soared. Dr. Jason Nagata, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California San Francisco who treats teens hospitalized with eating disorders, told BuzzFeed News that his clinic saw more than a doubling in the number of teens needing inpatient care during the pandemic. Dr. Tracy Richmond, director of the Eating Disorder Program at Boston Children’s Hospital and professor of pediatrics at Harvard, said her clinic saw a similar increase.The Reset/TTP report is the latest of several experiments that show Instagram promoting pro-ana recommendations to teen users. But the new report also shows how the platform has facilitated the creation of self-destructive online communities — and how it has failed to protect vulnerable members of those communities.People with eating disorders often resist efforts by family members, doctors, and other care teams to urge them into recovery, and share strategies and “tricks” to facilitate that resistance. Nagata described incidents of hospitalized teenagers using the geolocation features on their phones to find patients in neighboring rooms and wards with whom they could exchange tips about how to hide food and deceive hospital personnel. S. Bryn Austin, director of the Strategic Training Initiative for the Prevention of Eating Disorders at the Harvard School of Public Health, called care evasion a “hallmark of eating disorders.”But though Richmond used to hear concerns from parents that placing their children in residential care might lead them to “learn tricks” from other patients, she said that today, “kids are learning it all online.” Austin agreed — Instagram and other social networks have enabled vulnerable users to access self-destructive tips and techniques at a scale beyond what researchers have seen before. Advertisement     Still, it’s not clear why the platform has done so little to stop them. The Reset/TTP researchers found that pro-ana users frequently prepare “backup” accounts with the expectation that their primary accounts will be disabled, and that they congregate around coded, misspelled, or alternately spelled hashtags to avoid detection by content moderation systems. But none of this is new. Harmful groups including QAnon, the boogaloo boys, anti-vaccine activists, and various militias used backup accounts and misspelled hashtags on Instagram and its sibling Facebook for years — giving the platforms plenty of experience in detecting and enforcing against their tactics.The Reset/TTP researchers also found, though, that users vulnerable to pro-ana posts are often targeted in direct messages, and from there are sometimes urged to move from Instagram to encrypted chat apps like Kik and Telegram. And Instagram’s rules about DMs are markedly different from their rules about what can be said in a post or a comment.“Because DMs are for private conversations,” Instagram says in a company blog post from February 2021, “we don't use technology to proactively detect content like hate speech or bullying the same way we do in other places.” This creates a powerful loophole for policy enforcement in DMs: Content must be reported by a user. Accordingly, users who support one another’s violations of platform rules (in group chats of white nationalists, for example, or groups of people with anorexia who want to help each other get thinner) are free to DM content that violates Instagram’s community guidelines without consequences. An Instagram spokesperson confirmed that the company still does not scan direct messages for content that violates its community standards, even in messages sent to children, explaining, “we want to respect peoples’ privacy in DMs.”A similar problem presents in Instagram’s approach to search restrictions. When users search for certain pro-ana terms on Instagram, they receive a message offering resources for users struggling with body image issues. Eating disorder specialists who spoke with BuzzFeed News were quick to laud this “redirect” initiative, but users who do not want those resources are free to dismiss the message and view the content that they searched for in the first place. So while the message may be helpful to a casual searcher, it likely cannot help the users at the highest risk of self-harm. Advertisement     Experts also agreed that addressing pro-ana content on Instagram would require a more comprehensive approach than the platform has taken today. Nagata and Richmond both emphasized that cumulative exposure to “‘thinspo,” even less extreme varieties, plays an important role in patients’ trajectories. Lauren Muhlheim, an eating disorder specialist in private practice in Los Angeles, went further, saying that to protect users from eating disorders, platforms must also more forcefully target the “extreme bullying of larger-bodied people on these platforms.” Researchers at Reset and TTP found instances of bullying against larger-bodied users under a hashtag titled #reversethinspo. Richmond, though, was quick to spot a silver lining: More than ever before, she said, “there is health-at-every-size and body positive celebration on social media now.”Still, “regulators must take action,” she said, “and platforms must take responsibility – to protect young people, at least, if not everyone.”Emily Baker-White previously held policy positions at Facebook and Spotify.

360,"“The data suggests this is a more transmissible virus with significant degrees of immune escape, that is going to render the vaccines less effective,” said one expert.","


South African researchers on Tuesday reported the Omicron coronavirus variant appears to dodge vaccines, but only partially. The results, from a small laboratory study, suggest people who have recovered from COVID-19 and been vaccinated will retain strong protection, but those who have only received the two-dose vaccine regimen could be significantly more vulnerable to infection. The study did not examine the effects of boosters but suggests their protection could be important against Omicron.Since the Thanksgiving holiday, concern has grown worldwide over the appearance of the Omicron variant, which shows signs of increased contagiousness compared to other COVID-19 variants. Originally reported in South Africa, there are now case reports in over 50 countries, and at least 19 US states, so far. Advertisement     The new finding from the Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI) in Durban, South Africa, is in some ways reassuring for people who have had both their shots and a past COVID-19 infection, said outside experts, and suggests raising booster shots as a priority. But the finding — which experts caution is preliminary — raises concerns for those whose initial vaccination-induced antibodies may be waning.“I think we're in a situation where we all hoped we would be reporting something different,” said Harvard Medical School’s Jacob Lemieux.“But the reality is that the data suggests this is a more transmissible virus with significant degrees of immune escape, that is going to render the vaccines less effective, and most of the monoclonal antibodies ineffective, coming in a surge upon a surge at a really challenging time,” Lemieux said, citing concern about a variant-enhanced surge as holiday travel increases ahead of Christmas and New Year’s.In the new study of blood samples taken from a dozen people previously vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, researchers led by AHRI’s Alex Sigal found that their antibodies were not sufficient to “neutralize” the variant in half of them — those who had never had an infection before.However, half of the study participants had previously been infected with COVID-19. Of those six participants, five of them saw “relatively high neutralization” against the variant.
 


Sigal said in a tweet that the result was “better than I expected for Omicron,” showing that the variant was still vulnerable to vaccines overall and that it infected cells in a manner similar to other variants. In showing that the variant only incompletely evaded vaccines, the study also suggested that shots should remain effective against severe disease, especially when supplemented with a booster.That said, the results overall reported a 40-fold drop in antibody activity against the Omicron variant as compared to vaccine antibody neutralization of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain of coronavirus, a much larger evasion than was seen from other variants.The blood plasma study is still a preprint and has not yet gone through peer review by other scientists, raising some caution, but not enough to outweigh its newsworthiness, said experts.“I think there's consensus among us that even though the numbers are small, that they're coming from a reputable lab that's done this before and are not surprising,” said infectious disease expert Bruce Walker of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness.“The effects are not subtle. So it's likely to be correct.”Earlier on a White House briefing, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony Fauci had described very preliminary reports from South Africa of increased transmissibility of the variant as evidenced by increased cases of reinfection among those previously infected by the Beta and Delta variants there.Fauci also described “very preliminary” study results, also from South Africa, that the Omicron variant tended to produce less severe disease than past ones. “Hopefully in the next few weeks we’ll get a much clearer picture,” he said. “But it appears that with the cases that are seen, we are not seeing a very severe profile of disease. In fact, it might be — and I underscore might — be less severe, as shown by the ratio of hospitalizations per number of new cases.”A much more transmissible but only slightly less dangerous version of COVID-19 would still overwhelm hospitals in a heightened surge, noted Lemieux, the Harvard Medical School researcher. In past surges, death rates have increased as hospital intensive care units have filled up. Advertisement

361,Travis Scott has sparked outrage after new court documents revealed he “generally denies the allegations” filed against him following the Astroworld tragedy last month.,"


The majority of the suits have been filed against Scott and various connected companies — including Cactus Jack Records and Live Nation — by the families of the victims, as well as security guards at the event. According to reports, the lawsuits are seeking a collective sum of roughly $3 billion in damages. Advertisement     
 


Prior to this, Scott had addressed the tragedy in two statements posted to Twitter and Instagram on Nov. 6 and 7. In both accounts, he maintained that he was “absolutely devastated” by the events that had taken place, before pledging a commitment to “help assist” and “support the families in need.” 
 


The Blount family’s lawyer, Bob Hilliard, reportedly wrote in a letter to Scott's attorney: “Your client’s offer is declined... I have no doubt Mr. Scott feels remorse. His journey ahead will be painful. He must face and hopefully see that he bears some of the responsibility for this tragedy.” Advertisement     
 


Philip Corboy, the attorney for the families of 21-year-olds Jacob Jurinek and Franco Patino, alleged that the families “realized quickly that all [Scott] was trying to do was trying to lessen the public outcry on his case.”Meanwhile, the attorney for the family of 14-year-old John Hilgert, Richard Mithoff, said: “This family is set on making change and ensuring this never happens at a concert again. I find offering to pay for funerals frankly demeaning and really inappropriate to the magnitude of the tragedy that unfolded.

Early in the morning on Dec. 7, 1941, Japan's Imperial Navy launched a surprise airstrike on the US military base at Pearl Harbor on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. As a result, 2,403 Americans were killed, and more than 1,000 were wounded.The United States had considered itself neutral in World War II up until that point and entered battle the following day on the side of the Allied forces. Of the eight Navy battleships stationed at Pearl Harbor at the time, four were sunk in the attack. All but the USS Arizona were raised and restored to go on and fight in the war.Eighty years later, the attack on Pearl Harbor and the US's involvement in WWII show a long and complicated legacy. Americans responded with horror and began fully preparing themselves to enter the war. There were also countless acts of racism and senseless violence against Asian Americans. This anti-Asian bias later led to the incarceration of Japanese Americans and Japanese citizens living in the United States.

365,The internal warnings shed new light into how some within the department had deep concerns about the safety of Haitians being returned to their home country.,"


The Department of Homeland Security’s civil rights office raised an internal warning to immigration and border officials that deporting Haitians to their volatile home country risked violating US civil and human rights obligations and advised them against the practice in late August, according to an internal document obtained by BuzzFeed News.The existence of a late summer internal warning about removals to Haiti from DHS’ Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), including discussions of violating international standards, sheds new light on how some within the department had deep concerns about the safety of Haitians who could be sent back. Advertisement     President Biden’s decision in September to begin a mass deportation campaign caused alarm among not only immigrant advocates, but also prominent Democratic politicians and highlighted how the White House was turning to restrictive policies in times of political crisis.The CRCL office believed that if removals of Haitians, which had been on pause at the time of the warning in late August, resumed “any time in the near future,” it would put the DHS at risk of violating its human rights obligations. The office believed the pause in deportations back to Haiti was necessary due to the violence, political instability, and recent earthquake that led to severe damage and hundreds of deaths. Officials at Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection were told that DHS had already laid out how it was unsafe to return Haitians when the Biden administration granted them Temporary Protected Status (TPS) earlier this year.“These conditions create a risk of danger to deportees due to perceived political opinion and/or individual demographic characteristics (e.g., a high risk of refoulement),” the civil rights office communicated to ICE and CBP officials on Aug. 31, according to the internal document obtained by BuzzFeed News. The memo also pointed to a recent Department of State travel advisory listing Haiti at the highest level of danger due to the likelihood of life-threatening risks.
 


Specifically, the CRCL office was concerned that restarting removals to Haiti would risk “refoulement,” a term for sending an asylum-seeker back to a country where they will likely face persecution, in violation of human rights and international refugee law. In the aftermath of the Biden administration’s decision to remove thousands of Haitians, United Nations officials publicly raised the possibility that the deportations had possibly led to refoulement.“The situation for Haitians who have been deported back to Haiti is extremely dire,” said Nicole Phillips, an adjunct professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, and legal director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance. “Everybody faces danger right now, but those who’ve been deported face an extra layer of danger.”Phillips said many of those who were deported back to Haiti had not lived in the country for years, or owed money to people who helped them leave. As a result, she said deportees were at an increased risk of extortion and kidnapping from gangs.A DHS spokesperson said that following the earthquake in August, deportations of Haitians were suspended, but that after the embassy in Haiti determined that conditions had improved, they were restarted.“DHS worked very closely with the government of Haiti and the State Department to ensure that returns were done safely, including the dedication of resources in Haiti for the humane receipt of individuals,” the spokesperson said.Throughout September, the Biden administration relied on the Title 42 policy, which cites the pandemic to give border agents the ability to quickly turn back asylum-seekers, as a means to remove Haitians from a camp in Del Rio, Texas.In September and October alone, DHS officials used Title 42 to expel thousands of Haitians back to Haiti. The agency also sent back more than 250 Haitians through the more traditional “removal” process during that time, according to agency statistics. Advertisement     Since the invocation of Title 42, DHS officials have referred to the act of returning someone to their home country under the policy as an “expulsion” separate from the typical “deportation” or “removal” process. The document obtained by BuzzFeed News refers to “removals” and “deportees” but focuses its warning on the act of returning people to potential danger in Haiti.The advocacy group Witness at the Border reported this week that more than 9,000 Haitians have been returned to the country since the Biden administration began the mass deportations in September.To justify the use of removing so many Haitians months after granting them TPS due to the instability in their home country, Biden administration officials have said that the conditions on the ground would allow for returns.In an interview on CNN in September, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas acknowledged the decision to grant TPS earlier this year before explaining the new dynamics.“We then continued to study the conditions in Haiti, as is our responsibility. And we made a determination, based upon the facts, that, in fact, individuals could be safely returned to Haiti,” he said on Sept. 26, several weeks after the message from the DHS civil rights officials made its way to ICE and CBP.The situation on the ground in Haiti has only devolved in recent months following a magnitude 7.2 earthquake that killed more than 2,000 people, as well as the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse this summer. In its travel warning, the State Department notes that kidnapping is widespread and sophisticated. Elsewhere, violent crime, including armed robbery, is common and protests and demonstrations, which sometimes turn violent, are frequent.
 


“Do not travel to Haiti due to kidnapping, crime, civil unrest, and COVID-19,” the travel advisory states. Earlier in October, a group of 17 missionaries from the US and Canada were kidnapped for ransom. In recent months, kidnappings have shot up and instability has only grown, especially as a fuel shortage exacerbated Haiti’s deepening crisis. Advertisement     In the days after the initial wave of mass deportations of Haitians began under the Biden administration, a lead UN official blasted the decision.“The summary, mass expulsions of individuals currently underway under the Title 42 authority, without screening for protection needs, is inconsistent with international norms and may constitute refoulement,” UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in a statement.Even internally, the decision to deport Haitians has led to resignations and public criticism from longtime government officials and Biden appointees.“I will not be associated with the United States’ inhumane, counterproductive decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees and illegal immigrants to Haiti, a country where American officials are confined to secure compounds because of the danger posed by armed gangs in control of daily life,” Daniel Foote, the US envoy to Haiti under the Biden administration, said in a resignation letter obtained by the New York Times.A former Biden administration official at the State Department also wrote about his opposition to the deportations in an internal email to staffers upon his exit from his role.A group of UN human rights experts also publicly criticized the Biden administration’s decision to deport so many in a short period of time.“In expediting the collective expulsion of Haitian migrants, the United States is subjecting a group of predominantly Black migrants to impermissible risks of refoulement and human rights abuse without any individualised evaluation,” the experts said in a statement.

366,“I want it to be understood that I’m not scorned. I’m not sad because I didn’t get him as a boyfriend.”,"


Jenny (not her real name), 35, said that a man approached her and said hi while she was walking on the beach with her 9-year-old daughter last September. “He had a mask on, so I didn’t really pay much attention,” she told me. He walked away and then circled back and pulled down his mask. She recognized the actor immediately. David (a pseudonym) was down-to-earth, handsome, and charming. “He started asking me more personal questions about myself and ended up giving me his phone number. I was kind of in disbelief, and I didn’t really know what he wanted,” she said.She said they began DM’ing after she tweeted at him later that day. “He was really nice at first, and he did seem interested in me as a person,” she said. She said she told him about her past experience with abuse and how she had experienced PTSD. “I felt that by doing that, I was letting him know that I wasn’t in a position to be objectified,” she said.About two days later, she recalled, the messages changed in tone. “It was abrupt. It [went] from talking about normal life … and then [he] started requesting very sexual, and — now that I look back at it — very embarrassing things,” she said. She told me he asked for nude photos and explicit videos, which she sent and basked in his attention via Snapchat, phone calls, FaceTime, and texts. Advertisement  They discussed meeting again in real life, but he said he wasn’t interested in a relationship. He said “he [had] just gotten out of one, that he couldn’t be there emotionally,” she told me. “I was OK with that.” But Jenny felt that he was sending mixed messages. “He was insisting he didn’t want a relationship while asking for things you would ask for in a relationship, like exclusivity,” she said. She told him she wasn’t dating anyone else, but he didn’t offer the same on his end. He also asked her not to tell any of her friends about what they were doing. “He [said] he was a really private person and he values his privacy, which I understand because he’s a public figure. But it was also a level of secrecy that made me feel uncomfortable,” she said.Then, she recalled, he asked for something new. “He wanted to do this whole dom-sub thing,” which she said he had never stated outright but implied through his actions. He told her to refer to him as “sir” and to answer his questions with a “yes, sir.” When she had an orgasm over video chat, she had to say his name and then say “thank you” when she was done.Later, she said, he started pestering her for increasingly explicit photos and videos. If she had raised any concerns, she said, rather than address how he was making her feel, he would say things like, “You [said] you were OK with it.” “It really, really messed with my head the whole time because he kept insisting he didn’t want a relationship, but he kept contacting me for months.” She said she stayed in touch with him for nearly a year, assuming that the actor was seeing other women — he was a movie star, after all — but also feeling pressured into doing things she didn’t want to do. Advertisement  Stories like Jenny’s are emblematic of the messy post-#MeToo debates swirling around sex, power, and agency — especially in celebrity–civilian encounters. More and more stories are popping up on social media about these interactions and the complicated feelings women have about them — particularly around expectations of honesty. And perhaps most crucially, women now feel more comfortable uniting with each other to call out the power imbalances. But not everyone agrees on the most effective way to do it or how best to untangle the thorny questions that arise.
 


This summer, Jenny began following Deuxmoi, a crowdsourced celebrity gossip Instagram account. Deuxmoi, which declined to comment for this story, publishes unverified and uncorroborated reader-submitted comments about celebrities, including anything from sightings to purported leaks of information. The account's bio reads, “statements made on this account have not been independently confirmed. this account does not claim any information published is based in fact.” Advertisement  Rebecca Ortiz, an assistant professor at Syracuse University who studies the #MeToo movement and social media, said that accounts like Deuxmoi are useful for women precisely because they can’t be verified. “Somebody with power [is] going to be able to use that power against anybody who is accusing them. … To gain any power back, you have to sometimes go into these anonymous ‘unverified spaces’ because you’re not being heard anywhere else,” Ortiz said. But sharing stories anonymously can lead to backlash. “Voicing those stories in a space that isn’t verified plays into that tendency we have already to question victims and survivors. But it’s not the space itself doing that, it’s our culture. ”It’s possible that untrue accusations of sexual assault could be shared on sites like Deuxmoi; the account has posted tips that later turned out to be false. But a fear of being accused of lying has led many women to keep quiet about assault, Ortiz said. That’s why some are more comfortable sharing their stories anonymously, particularly after the #MeToo movement led them to recognize they weren’t alone, she added.Jenny saw a series of posts about a famous fortysomething actor from an early aughts TV show cavorting around New York City with different women. (We’ll call him John.) The posts featured reader-submitted sightings: John at a downtown hot spot with his arm around a woman, or at a famed restaurant with another woman. Advertisement  These posts contained unverified information from unidentified sources but still inspired passionate conversations. Some readers reveled in the drama of John’s paramours finding out about each other, while others claimed to be the women from the posts, tweeting about being surprised or jokingly suggesting they all meet up because there were so many of them.With claims like these proliferating on the internet, many of them impossible to authenticate, discussing celebrity activities with such fervor might seem trivial or unjustified. But Hilde Van den Bulck, a professor of communication studies at Drexel University, doesn’t think so. “When we talk about celebrities, we’re talking about ourselves,” she said. She has analyzed reader reactions to celebrity sex scandals and found that even though most people begin discussions with comments about the celebrity, they move on to more general issues.
 


Dissecting a famous person’s sex life allows people to “talk about things that are difficult to talk about,” she said. “Even in 2021, talking about sex is still not that [easy]. It may be more easy to talk about [sex] through celebrities.” These conversations allow people to ask, Where do we stand as a society? Should we rethink our norms?One of the women who said she met John over the summer was 24-year-old Casey. She attended an exclusive early aughts–themed party on New York City’s Lower East Side with her 23-year-old friend. John stood out among the sea of beautiful twentysomethings. He approached the pair and asked for Casey’s friend’s number.A few weeks later, Casey said, she ran into the actor at a bar in Brooklyn and he hit on her. “I don’t even think he remembered meeting me when I was with my friend. I think he’s just probably hooked up with a lot of young girls that it probably doesn’t even register,” she said. She turned him down.I asked Casey about the group of Deuxmoi readers who had called John out. While she thought it was weird for someone in his 40s to hang out with people in their 20s, she said women shouldn’t be complaining. “You can’t be like, ‘I’m being taken advantage of,’ because you’re not a child. You’re an adult. You clearly want to date someone with more money.” And she said the power differential works both ways. For example, some women might have wanted to have sex with him because they were Instagram influencers. “Once they find out he’s wealthy and has been on TV, that’s a motivating factor [for them],” she said. “On one [hand], these women are clearly using him for clout. And on the other hand, he’s clearly using them because they’re hot and young, so it’s on both ends a little messed up.”It’s not a new story: women trading youth and beauty for social status, and men using wealth and fame for access to youth and beauty. “Youth and attractiveness is a different type of power,” said Justin Lehmiller, a research fellow who studies the psychology of sex at the Kinsey Institute. “There’s this tendency for the job and the money to be the sole focus of these power conversations, and I don’t think that’s the full picture.”Meanwhile, Deuxmoi began publishing posts from women who were sleeping with other celebrities, and even more stories about the stars flooded in.Jenny was inspired by what she read on Deuxmoi and wondered if other women had had exploitative experiences with David.She tapped out a DM to the account asking if she could connect with other women who’d had encounters with David, which it reposted. Like Deuxmoi’s other Instagram stories, it stayed up for 24 hours before disappearing. She waited by her phone, curious whether anyone would reach out.
 


Celebrities are sexy precisely because they have power and fame; some of their fans crave proximity to that. “The idea of sleeping with a celebrity is a really popular sexual fantasy and one that most people will never have the opportunity to act out,” said Lehmiller. In a comprehensive survey of sexual fantasies published in his book Tell Me What You Want, Lehmiller found that 63% of heterosexual women claimed to have had that desire.Some who do get to interact with celebrities no longer just tell their closest friends about it; they share their stories on social media. In May, a 19-year-old celebrity assistant shared on TikTok a screencap purportedly from her FaceTime call with then–51-year-old actor Matthew Perry after they matched on the dating app Raya, which she thought was “innocent” at the time. She later told Page Six: “It’s not really OK for these older guys to be talking to such young girls.” (Perry did not respond to a BuzzFeed News request for comment.)One impact of the #MeToo movement has been women alleging on social media negative and even abusive experiences they’ve had with celebrities. In some cases, the celebrities have faced consequences. Recent sexual abuse accusations lodged on Twitter against comedian Chris D’Elia led to a lawsuit, his manager dropping him, and him being recast in a movie. (D’Elia denied the allegations.) A former employee of Andrew Cuomo, then the New York governor, made accusations of sexual harassment on Twitter. The governor was investigated by New York’s attorney general and has since resigned. (Cuomo denied the allegations.) Armie Hammer was accused of rape in March by a woman running the Instagram account @houseofeffie. Other women then contacted her, saying Hammer had abused or manipulated them, and she posted screenshots of alleged texts between Hammer and some of these women. (Hammer denied the allegations.) Advertisement  But while most public #MeToo allegations are related to potential crimes, many of the claims surfaced by Deuxmoi neither rise to the level of criminality nor become anything more than an uninvestigated Instagram blip. As one woman who said she was involved with David told me, “This is not a #metoo case, but it is a callout and condemnation for disrespect toward women.”Some readers thought that Deuxmoi’s posts were intrusive. “Why should the general public need to know if any actor sleeps around if they’re doing so legally and consensually? Millions of non famous men do that every day, are we gonna ‘expose’ them too?” one person wrote on a Deuxmoi subreddit (not officially associated with Deuxmoi). Another user chimed in: “Is it a cultural revolution to do the male version of slut-shaming?”Recently, a New York Post article, inspired by Deuxmoi’s posts purportedly about the dating life of Succession actor Nicholas Braun, was called out on Twitter and Reddit for relying on unverified accounts and for dissecting the actor’s alleged liaisons. ""Lol, what’s the story? Pleasant, personable male celebrity has no shortage of women interested in him? If he’s abusive or violent, expose him by all means, but that doesn’t seem to be the case by all accounts, so who cares?” one person wrote on the r/SuccessionTV subreddit. (Braun did not respond to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News.) Advertisement  Lehmiller said that criticizing someone who’s dating several people isn’t necessarily slut-shaming unless the focus is the “sheer number of sexual partners.” If a person isn’t transparent about having many partners, they could be criticized for practicing “unethical nonmonogamy … because the people involved are not consenting to what’s going on. And so then it becomes this violation of trust when they actually find out what’s happening.” But it depends on the circumstances; miscommunication can be a factor in people’s expectations of a romantic connection. “In a lot of relationships, monogamy is just assumed rather than being negotiated and defined,” he said.
 


After Deuxmoi posted her message, Jenny said it wasn’t long before her phone started blowing up. “There were women in the double digits contacting me,” she said. “It was constant.” So she started a group text where the women could compare notes about their experiences with David. One of those women was Madison (whose name has been changed for privacy). The 34-year-old said she met David in fall 2018 while she was working as a marketing and events manager at a private social house in LA and doing sketch comedy on the side. “We genuinely connected over talking about comedy,” she told me. “I was telling someone, ‘I feel like he’s going to mentor me.’”Madison said they started exchanging emails in which he would tell her to have a beautiful day or call her lovely. She recalled that one day he came into the club with his girlfriend and awkwardly introduced them to each other. The girlfriend seemed cold. But the emails continued. “It was all incredibly flattering. … And I was like, OK, maybe he’s not with his girlfriend anymore.”
 


She suggested that they move to texting. But as soon as that started, she claimed, he began acting like a different person. “It felt very Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde.” He began asking for explicit pictures, she recalled, and she asked if he still had a girlfriend. According to her, he said he did but that she was OK with him having this sort of connection with other women. Madison said she declined to send photos but claimed that he kept trying to push their communications into a sexual realm. “I kept either avoiding it or not acknowledging it or [saying,] ‘Hey, I just want to be friends,’” she said. She said she wasn’t sure about his motives. She thought, Is this person still interested in my career? Do they want to help me?She said she eventually stopped communicating with him. Several months later, a new TV show he’d worked on aired. She watched the early episodes and noticed there was a character with her name. “At first I was flattered, but it also just felt kind of messed up because this is someone who has so much power and has an authority over my career — not directly, but it felt like this person was taking everything they could from me, even when I didn't want to give it to them. And then, at the end of it all, he took my name.”When she saw Jenny’s post on Deuxmoi, she decided to get in touch “to see if it maybe would be healing or therapeutic in some way,” she said. What she found disturbed her.
 


In the group chat, Madison discovered that her story about David was actually tame compared to others’. Many of the women said they had experienced manipulation and pressure to have sex with him and make sexual videos for him. They said he continued to ask them to perform sexual acts and record these videos even after they’d refused, and that he had sent messages to many of them for months, persuading them that the more videos they sent, the more extreme the sex acts, the more he would like them. When they’d told David they weren’t comfortable with something sexually, he would talk them out of their hesitancy, they said. “Some men … believe that to get a ‘yes,’ they have to go through a couple ‘no’s first. But is that really a yes? Is that really consent? No, it’s not consent. It’s coercion,” said Rebecca Ortiz, the Syracuse professor.“If you have to talk the woman into doing something she originally says she didn’t want to, that’s pretty messed up,” Jenny said. Some of the women in the group chat claimed that he’d lied to them about being monogamous, possibly putting their sexual health in jeopardy because he’d said he didn’t want to use condoms.“It was pretty overwhelming for all of us,” Jenny said, particularly because some of the women believed that they were dating the actor. Those women “were heartbroken” to find out that there were dozens of others, she said. But the group was cathartic. “Every woman was like, ‘Oh, my gosh, I have clarity I haven’t had, and I’ve been just suffering. I’ve talked to friends, to family, and nobody can give me that clarity, because nobody knows what it’s like, especially to have gone through it with the same person,’” she said. “In sharing our experiences, we really felt validated. … It was so relieving for all of us, like, we’re not crazy. We’re not being too emotional.” Advertisement  Not all the women in the group shared negative comments about David. Jenny recalled that one person said she’d had “a pleasant experience” but was respectful of the others. “They were still very supportive of validating and listening to the ones that did have different experiences,” Jenny said. “Nobody was like, ‘Oh, well, that’s not what I had. He’s just a nice guy.’ It was like, ‘I’m so sorry that that happened.’”Jenny and Madison believe David’s behavior with them was coercive. Andrew Pari, a counselor and expert on sexual trauma, said some of the behavior outlined by the women I spoke to could fall within what some psychologists refer to as a “gray area” of consent — and that men are usually aware when a woman doesn’t completely consent. For instance, Pari said, a man asking for explicit pictures and videos after a woman said no, even if she eventually agreed, could be construed as coercive.But according to legal experts, that doesn’t amount to assault. “Verbal ‘coercion’ just by constant pleading or persuasion isn’t enough for rape or any other crime,” Stephen J. Schulhofer, an New York University law professor who studies rape and consent law, told me in an email. “Only if the verbal coercion is a threat of physical injury, then it’s rape.” Advertisement     Susan Estrich, a law professor at the University of Southern California, gave this hypothetical. “If he finally said, ‘I’ll kill you if you don’t do it,’ [then that’s assault],” she said. But if he said, “‘Can I ask one more time?’ And she said, ‘Oh, alright,’ that’s known as persuasion.”Still, Pari said, the cultural conversation around #MeToo hasn’t caught up to the nuances of coercion, exploitation, and abuse. He said a person would be acting ethically if they explained that they were not interested in a relationship and acted accordingly. “But if he’s seriously dating and acting like there’s a deep relationship forming when there isn’t, then that’s abusive and coercive,” Pari said. “Most predators will use the least invasive method of getting what they want so that they can create the false impression in the mind of their victim that they were consenting and complicit,” he said.The conversation about consent has come a long way. “I used to fight with people literally about whether no meant yes,” Estrich said. “Now, I think everybody agrees that no means no.” But, Estrich said, both conduct and context matter. “The fact that sex may be inappropriate doesn’t mean it’s unlawful ... unless it’s nonconsensual. And traditionally the law required force or threat of force.” However, she cautioned, “I don’t think we want to infantilize women. We don’t want to assume that we’re not capable of acting as autonomous people.” Advertisement     
 


Madison was troubled not just by the claims in the group chat but also by how the other women felt about David’s alleged actions. “Women seem really upset and afraid of him, and afraid about talking about it or going forward or doing anything with it,” she said. So she and Jenny decided to take action. “I don’t want him to keep doing this to women,” she said. “I kind of feel like I have a responsibility to try to do something or share this information.” Madison and Jenny drafted a statement on behalf of the group:[David] is an extremely manipulative person whose actions have caused emotional distress, trauma and fear to many of the women with whom he has engaged with. He has even put some of these women’s physical wellbeing into question. He has used sexual coercion and fame to take advantage of women and satisfy his own desires, with little or no regard to the emotional and at times physical safety of his partners. Advertisement     They hoped to post it on Deuxmoi, but the account declined. One woman who told me she had a sexual relationship with David claimed that he “has herpes and did not disclose that to [her] or any women he was romantically involved with.” She added, “This is not just bad behavior, it’s also a crime in California.” (Under California law, knowingly passing on a sexually transmitted infection is a misdemeanor. Schulhofer, the NYU law professor, said that transmitting an STD can be considered a crime; however, in California and most states, “the defendant has to INTEND to transmit the STD,” he wrote in an email.) She also said that David is aware of the group chat “and he tried to turn the women in this group against one another (unsuccessfully of course).”Jenny is aware that they could be dismissed as a group of women motivated by heartache and revenge. But they wanted to highlight the real-life experiences of unequal sexual relationships. “I want it to be understood that I’m not scorned. I’m not sad because I didn’t get him as a boyfriend,” she said.They also aren’t interested in ruining his career. “I just don’t really want women to be treated this way,” Madison said. “I feel like there needs to be an education in our society that just because someone isn’t raping women doesn’t mean what they’re doing is OK.” Advertisement     These kinds of stories have allowed women who are grappling with questions about power and sexual agency to realize that their experiences are not unusual. “The #MeToo movement has emboldened [these] women to say, ‘Yes, we can group together and be a force,’” Van den Bulck said. But that doesn’t necessarily make it any easier to untangle the dynamics of a celebrity–civilian relationship.The way we think about celebrity–civilian relationships has shifted dramatically over the past decade. Tasha R. Howe, a psychology professor at Humboldt State University who studied rock groupies from the 1980s, found in a 2014 study that most of the ’80s heavy metal groupies she surveyed did not regret having sex with rock stars. Seventy-eight percent of respondents did not feel that band members had “used them.” One former groupie told the researchers: “We all knew what we were doing. … We had no strings attached; everyone kind of used each other. … Everyone was young, having fun. … I never felt used or even disrespected.”The 1980s were “a very different time in terms of acceptance of casual sex,” Lehmiller said.“There’s a lot more expectation of accountability for bad sexual behavior [now], even if it’s not in the realm of sexual assault, but [rather] somebody who is engaging in behavior that feels exploitative or manipulative in some way,” he said. “I think people today are much more inclined to want to see that person held accountable for their actions than they were in the past. And I think that’s partially a product of #MeToo and these conversations we’ve been having lately around sexual consent.” Advertisement     “When a guy that’s powerful in Hollywood promises a model or actress to help her get a part in the film and she sleeps with them, what do you call that?” Estrich asked. “How far do we want to go in saying that sexuality cannot be an element of a bargain? And at what point does pressure of one sort or another make sex nonconsensual? … We do need to talk about these gray areas. They’re legitimate questions. And right now people are afraid to discuss them.”Madison hopes these stories expand the scope of what behavior we deem unacceptable from celebrities. “Our culture at large does not really recognize [this kind of behavior] as abusive,” she said. “I really want some kind of spotlight to be put on predatory behavior in celebrities and people in powerful positions. And I know that the #MeToo movement has brought a lot of that, but it’s not enough. I just think that we’re still so far behind understanding these dynamics of manipulation and coercion and abuse and how nuanced they can be.”“What I want to see [from the collective],” Jenny said, “is a floodgate of women just being like, ‘Here’s my experience, and I’m finally free from this. I can finally speak my truth and be believed and be heard.’” Advertisement     After starting the group chat, Jenny said she called off her relationship with David via text and told him how harmful his behavior was. In his response, she said, he claimed he’d never wanted to hurt her and acknowledged her pain, but added that she was being harsh in how she was judging his actions. Then, she said, he followed up with another message, offering to have a video call to clear things up. He tried to video call her, she said; she did not respond. ●

367,"The Academy withdrew Swift, Antonoff, and St. Vincent — who have been publicly credited as “songwriters” on Rodrigo’s “Deja Vu” and “1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back” — from Sour’s Album of the Year nomination, after the trio were wrongfully listed.","


Interpolation refers to when parts of a song’s composition are rerecorded to create something new. It’s a different concept from sampling, which refers to a snippet being lifted from an original song.Rodrigo’s “Deja Vu” includes an interpolation of Swift’s “Cruel Summer,” a track she cowrote with Antonoff and Clark for her 2019 album, Lover. Meanwhile, “1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back” rearranges the notes from Swift’s 2017 song “New Year’s Day,” which was cowritten with Antonoff for her 2017 album, Reputation.
 


“During the submission process, the Academy received credits from the label for the track ‘deja vu,’” the statement purportedly read.“Last week, we received the correct credits from the label that recognize Annie Clark, Jack Antonoff and Taylor Swift as songwriters of an interpolation on the track, ‘deja vu,’” it continued.“In keeping with current Grammy guidelines, as songwriters of an interpolated track, Clark, Antonoff and Swift are not nominees in the album of the year category for Sour,” the statement said. The Academy also clarified that Antonoff and Swift remain Album of the Year nominees for their work on Swift’s album Evermore. Meanwhile, Antonoff also remains a nominee for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical, and Clark is still nominated for Best Alternative Music Album.
 


“We interpolated ‘New Year’s Day,’ which is Taylor’s song from Reputation,” Rodrigo said. “I came up with the ‘1 Step Forward’ concept and I sort of wrote a verse and a chorus. I was in the car on a road trip, and when I got home, I decided to sing it over the chords of ‘New Year's Day.’ I think they're really beautiful chords. I was lucky enough to get that approved, and it's on the record.”
 


Billboard estimated that for “Deja Vu,” Swift, Antonoff, and Clark would receive a combined share of 50%, while Rodrigo and Nigro split the rest. For “1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back,” the outlet estimated that Swift and Antonoff would receive around a third of the royalties each, with Rodrigo claiming the final third for writing the song by herself.And it wasn’t just Swift that Rodrigo reportedly gave royalties to. According to the report, the Sour singer offered credits to Paramore's Hayley Williams and Josh Farro, after her hit song “Good 4 U'' bore similarities to the band’s 2007 track “Misery Business.”

369,Expert witness testimony could potentially link Duggar to the child sexual abuse materials he was charged with “knowingly” receiving and possessing in April.,"


FAYETTEVILLE, Arkansas — Thumbnail images of child sexual abuse content that investigators say they found on the work computer of former 19 Kids and Counting reality star Josh Duggar — in addition to extensive geolocation data — prove that he was responsible for downloading the incriminating material, prosecutors argued Friday. Advertisement     Expert witness testimony could link Duggar to the child sexual abuse materials he was charged with “knowingly” receiving and possessing in April. He pleaded not guilty and faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for each count if he is convicted.In court, federal prosecutor William Clayman asked James Fottrell, a top forensics investigator at the Department of Justice, about the in-depth forensic analysis he conducted through Duggar’s work computer at Wholesale Motorcars.“Based on [your] review, who was present at the car lot every time child pornography was downloaded?” Clayman asked.“Josh Duggar,” Fottrell said.Fottrell’s testimony involved a minute-by-minute analysis comparing when child sexual abuse materials were downloaded on a discreet “partition” of the office computer with the time and place of photos and messages on Duggar’s old iPhone 8. Fottrell was able to access the backup of the phone via Duggar’s personal MacBook Pro. The times of the downloads on the work computer correlated with iPhone photos Duggar took at the car lot, as well as text messages he sent from the phone identifying he was at work, Fottrell testified. Advertisement     Not only did the phone point to Duggar being at the lot, but any child sexual abuse material on the work computer would have had to be downloaded manually, Fottrell said. That’s because the computer had something known as a Linux partition, in which the computer is essentially “split” into two distinct operating systems — one Microsoft Windows, the other Linux. In order to select the Linux side, Fottrell said, someone would need to physically hit a keyboard command.Remote access wouldn’t have allowed that function, he added, contradicting the defense’s assertion made in cross-examination that a remote user could have downloaded the materials on the office computer rather than Duggar himself.Fottrell said that while the “possibility exists” for remote access to the Linux system, what he found on the computer “doesn’t fit” that theory.The defense also questioned the speed and efficacy of Fottrell’s search, including a minor accident in which the internet turned on during his search through the computer, something that could have affected the viability of the evidence. But Fottrell said this had “minimal” effect on his evidence and conclusions.Fottrell reviewed with the jury an extensive timeline he compiled based on his findings from Duggar’s computer and iPhone backup after they were confiscated from Wholesale Motorcars via a search warrant in November 2019.The phone’s user took a photo at the car lot on May 11, and the Linux partition was downloaded the same day, Fottrell said. On May 13, the partition was installed in the afternoon around the same time the phone had a picture of a scale determined to be in the lot’s office, he added.Fottrell said he found a photo dated May 14 in the iPhone back-up that featured the HP computer's screen with a YouTube video pulled up. A reflection of whoever is sitting at the office desk is visible, as is the baseball hat they're wearing with the Wholesale Motorcars logo on it. Fottrell said he found a photo taken that same day in the iPhone back-up of Duggar and his wife Anna apparently shopping together -- Duggar donning a baseball cap with the Wholesale Motorcars' logo. Advertisement     Through text messages, Duggar had identified he was at the car lot on May 14.Also on that same day, Fottrell said there was evidence that bookmarks were created on an anonymous browser called uTorrent in the Linux partition for sites associated with child sexual abuse materials, and thumbnails for explicit content of minor girls were created.“I’m on the car lot now,” Duggar said in a text the morning of May 15. Minutes later, Fottrell said a file involving a minor girl giving oral sex was downloaded on the Linux partition via an anonymous browser called uTorrent. Minutes later, more child sexual abuse files were downloaded from uTorrent.The expert explained that computers basically make small ""thumbnail"" images for every full-size image on the device. Fottrell said he found thumbnails of this child sexual abuse content in the computer’s backend in his review, meaning full-sized versions of these materials and other child abuse materials he also detected must have been there at some point.Later that day, photos on the phone of a firetruck and an accident near the car lot were taken.Also on May 15, the user of the cellphone sent a text message indicating that they would be staying at the car lot until about 6 p.m. Shortly after, a file “Marissa.zip” was downloaded from an anonymous browser on the Linux partition and thumbnails of the file were created, indicating that the files were viewed, Fottrell said. The “Marissa series,” he explained, is a well-known and highly traded series of child sexual abuse content featuring the same girl in multiple explicit poses, some nude.The timing of the download aligns with the same moment that detective Amber Kalmer, who testified this week that her monitoring software flagged someone with an IP address in Springdale, Arkansas, downloading child sexual abuse materials. Kalmer was able to access the file herself, which included 65 images of the same minor girl in explicit poses. Advertisement     In another, on May 16, a thumbnail of a nearly 30-minute video was created just two minutes before a photo of a sticky note on the desk in Wholesale Motorcars' office was taken, Fottrell said the iPhone’s backup showed.The password “Intel1988” was also “ubiquitously used” by Duggar for over five years to access a range of accounts, including the Linux partition, Fottrell found.Through analysis of Duggar's personal MacBook Pro, Fottrell discovered the same password or iterations of it, used across his bank accounts and applications.Other potential proof involved a report from Covenant Eyes, the anti-porn software Duggar and his wife Anna had used that generated regular reports on each other’s exposure. Fottrell cited a report from the software, dated 2017, flagging that Duggar had attempted to download uTorrent and the service blocked him. The report and similar entries showed that he had made multiple attempts to access the same anonymous browser the witness would find on the Linux partition that was eventually used to download child sexual abuse materials.Further, Fottrell said he found that the ""recently played"" history of a media player someone would have installed on the Linux partition indicated that files known to contain child sexual abuse materials were “streamed” right from the office computer, rather than an internet source.Duggar gained widespread fame and a conservative following for his time on TLC’s 19 Kids and Counting, which tracked the ever-expanding family of his parents, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar. Their large household and ultraconservative beliefs also led to spinoffs. But in a 2015 Fox News interview, Josh Duggar admitted that he had molested five girls when he was a teenager, including his four younger sisters and a family babysitter. In the interview, the family said he and the girls received counseling and that they did not believe there was any future threat of wrongdoing; in their view, he had only been “curious about girls.”Duggar has been present for the past three days at court with his wife, Anna, sitting in the gallery with other family members. The couple exited the gallery holding hands during the court’s afternoon recess. His brother-in-law Derick Dillard has sat next to Anna for the last three days. His wife, Duggar’s estranged sister Jill Duggar, has been suggested as a potential witness in the case. Advertisement

370,"Yes, all the songs are real.","


When Christine Quinn makes her first appearance in the fourth season of Selling Sunset, it’s a moment of high camp. We’ve just watched a scene where — like most of the show — the other ladies in the Oppenheim Group real estate agency have been talking breathlessly about her. Now, she’s stepping out of a yellow Lamborghini to an $8 million property in the Hollywood Hills that looks like a drug lord’s palace. She’s heavily pregnant and looks impossibly glamorous, wearing a sleek black dress, a bedazzled blazer with arched shoulder pads, and a “chair purse” that she admits can’t actually hold anything.She has attitude. She’s a boss. She means business.Underscoring the moment is an electric bass-heavy bop with seemingly nonsensical lyrics: “Take my name out of your mouth / I don’t want to hear you talking when you’re around / ‘Cause everywhere I go it’s like you’re always there / But I don’t want to hear it / ‘Cause everybody wants a piece of what I got.” Advertisement     Like practically all the music in the show, “I Got Mine” is not a song you’ve likely ever heard before. And while its lyrics may be nonsense, they somehow perfectly meet the moment — and that’s exactly the point.“It’s ‘gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss’ vibes, 100%,” said Colby Lapolla, one of the song’s writers. “It’s been very funny to watch Twitter, and I feel like so many people have been talking about the music. They don’t understand that we know this is garbage.”
 


Since the latest season of the Netflix reality drama premiered last month, many fans have been wondering about the show’s “over the top” and “WILD” music. An average episode can feature snippets of around 15 songs, which usually serve as transitions as the ladies make glamorous exits from cars or tour luxury properties. They can, admittedly, all start to sound the same after a while.“The stock music in Selling Sunset is like music from a mall in hell,” writer Bolu Babalola tweeted. “They sound like songs except really not? Distinctly genreless.”“It’s like if someone wrote pop songs for aliens,” tweeted Lindsey Adler, a writer for the Athletic.
 


Parodies of the Selling Sunset song lyrics have also become something of a recurring joke online, with many mocking the seemingly random collection of girlboss buzzwords.
 


Carrie Hughes, the music supervisor on Selling Sunset, acknowledges the songs tend to share certain themes and sounds, but she insists they’re each unique. “It’s not really the same for me, because I work in music,” she said. “They have the same vibe, but they don’t sound the same to me.” Advertisement     Hughes’ job is a big one. A 10-episode season might contain as many as 150 songs, as well as hundreds of other musical cues without lyrics. Hughes needs to listen to thousands of tracks to find the right tune that an editor can then cut footage to. Sometimes an editor needs a specific sound for an emotional moment — say, a fight or tearful breakdown — so Hughes will send along options. Otherwise, she has a playlist ready to go of dozens of “female empowerment” songs that can be used for any transition where the lyrics don’t matter. She said that showrunner Adam DiVello, who also created Laguna Beach and The Hills, has a strict rule that they never repeat a song.“The showrunner definitely wanted ‘female empowerment’ [as a theme],” Hughes explained. “The other main word that gets thrown around is ‘feisty.’ So we kind of have two styles of female empowerment. One is just ‘helping all women,’ ‘we’re great,’ ‘we can do this,’ and then there’s more feisty, like, ‘I’m better than you’ vibes.”“It has a very city, trendy, cool vibe that is kind of universal,” said Jennifer Smith, who worked with Hughes on seasons 2 and 3, “so it doesn’t matter if you’re watching it in the UK, you can still identify with it even if you’ve never been to LA. It’s a universal sonic texture language.”The reason Selling Sunset is full of music you’ve never heard before is thus a practical one. It features an astonishing amount of music, and there’s only so much money to spend. “We don’t have the budget for Ariana or Beyoncé or Rihanna,” Hughes said. “We would love to, but we definitely don’t.”
 


To find music, Hughes speaks with various licensing companies, who themselves search for artists whose music they can sell to productions. Ty Salazar, the vice president of creative licensing for film and TV at Position Music, said his company controls the publishing rights for about 20,000 songs — 26 of which are featured in the latest season of Selling Sunset. Advertisement     “I would say they’re all bouncy pop,” he said of the Selling Sunset tunes. “They are all songs with drive and swagger. Typically, they have a female empowerment lyric or feel. There’s lyrics about being glamorous, being the best — that sort of thing.”He added, “We are always looking for what the majority of our clients need at the moment. Right now, this kind of female empowerment, drive songs with swagger is a very big need, and it’s kind of become our speciality.”Some musicians effectively make writing for licensing companies their full-time job. Knowing what the market demands, they’ll happily work with producers to pump out a supply of tunes in exchange for being paid each time the music is featured in a show or movie. Unlike other music, the point of these songs isn’t necessarily to get played on the radio — but that can actually be somewhat freeing, said Lapolla, the musician whose song was featured in Christine’s intro scene.“There’s not the pressure of like, I need to express myself right now. What do I want to say? What am I feeling? It’s fun to write stuff like this that is just fun,” she said.“We still write it with the intention that we want to release it as an artist,” said Michael McQuaid, a singer who partnered with Lapolla to form a group called Girl Fieri to write more music for licensing, “but we think at the back of our heads, How do we mold it to be a little more TV-friendly?”
 


Most of the songs controlled by the licensing companies aren’t made to order, though. Many are just from regular musicians who’ve uploaded their songs to streaming platforms and are hoping for the best — this despite speculation from some Selling Sunset viewers that the songs are “fake.”“It’s a very real song! We’re a very real band, and as far as I know that goes for all the acts on the show,” said Jes Marie, who is part of the group Chamie (pronounced like “chameleon”) with her husband Joe Sobalo Jr. Their song “Attitude,” produced in their home studio just before the pandemic, was featured in the final episode as Chrishell Stause tours a mansion with NBA star Thomas Bryant.“I kind of came up with the idea of an in-your-face, female empowerment track that you could get ready to go out with your girlfriends for the night and put it on and feel badass,” Marie said. “Selling Sunset is all about the ladies. It’s strong, beautiful women selling real estate, so I’m glad they thought our track worked for the show.”In addition to the artists being paid a modest amount (no one in this story would specify how much due to contractual secrecy), being featured on the show can lead to a respectable spike in streaming as people use Shazam to find certain songs. Some people have even curated Spotify playlists of all the music so people can vibe to a female empowerment track at home. One such playlist features 14 hours of songs, each one bright, poppy, and unabashedly lowbrow — just like the show itself. Advertisement     “I described the show to people that it’s such well-curated trash. It’s my trash. I own it,” Lapolla said. “The way it’s structured — like half HGTV, half the worst Bravo show you’ve ever seen — it’s like watching a trainwreck. I love it.”“The phenomenon around the music is so funny,” she added. “It’s a thing, but it wouldn’t work without the ridiculous music.”

371,"Without institutions they trust to protect them, Black activist groups in Wisconsin have turned to new tactics to defend themselves against digital and physical threats.","


Angela Lang woke up one Friday morning last spring to what she considered a threat from the president of Milwaukee’s Police Association, Dale Bormann, Jr.“If they feel that we can go after them, I’m going after them,” Dormann told a local news reporter, referring specifically to supporters of the city’s decision to ban chokeholds by police officers. “I have to do whatever it takes to protect my officers and make sure their careers are not ended if they end up using a chokehold.” Advertisement     As executive director of the advocacy group Black Leaders Organizing Communities, Lang was among the speakers who had vouched for the change before a meeting of the city’s fire and police commission, helping make Milwaukee’s one of the 32 police departments to ban chokeholds in the direct aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, according to an analysis by the Washington Post.“The audacity that this man was able to say this so brazenly and be quoted in an article and face no backlash was scary for me,” Lang said. Dormann did not respond to interview requests for this story.Though she had spoken out about police abuses for years, she considered the quote about “going after” proponents of the chokehold ban to be new territory, and a reflection of the evolving dangers activists face at a moment when right-wing militias show up armed to Black Lives Matter protests while the law enforcement authorities charged with keeping the peace openly oppose the policy changes protesters call for. During demonstrations in Kenosha, Wisconsin, after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, officers offered water to militia groups who had arrived from out of town and thanked them for showing up. One of the armed visitors, Kyle Rittenhouse, fatally shot two people, claimed self-defense, and was found not guilty on all charges last month.American law enforcement agencies have long played a role in suppressing racial justice movements — a history that spans state-sanctioned “slave catchers,” sheriffs donning Klan robes, police dogs in Birmingham, Cointelpro initiatives targeting the Black Panthers and civil rights leaders, and the FBI’s focus on what it calls “black identity extremists.” In recent years, far-right militias and disinformation groups have thrown their support behind efforts to disrupt Black Lives Matter protests, creating a tension all the more dangerous in states with gun laws that allow people to carry automatic weapons with minimal or no background check and self-defense laws that give wide latitude to people who say they feared for their lives. Advertisement     Without institutions they trust to protect them, Black activist groups in Wisconsin have turned to their own new tactics, including developing detailed security plans, identifying safe houses in advance, and traveling with their passports in case they suddenly have to flee, five activists told BuzzFeed News.
 


It’s a marked change from how Lang started her advocacy career back in 2007, when she was a first-year college student organizing on campus. “I had my book bag, I had my laptop, I had snacks and bumper stickers to get out the vote,” she remembers. “In all these years, it hasn’t been until the last year when I really had to start thinking about my safety.”Now, Lang said she never takes the same route home two days in a row. She gives copies of her house keys to trusted friends. In the trunk of her car, she keeps a go-bag containing her birth certificate, Social Security card, and a week’s worth of clothing.Another activist, Kyle Johnson, who pushes for more affordable housing for Black residents in the state, said that he operates with a “healthy sense of paranoia” that has led him to anti-doxing training, among other measures, “to protect us in the sense of being online and our information being circulated.” Advertisement     Wisconsin organizers saw up close what it means to be targeted by groups who oppose their message — last year, the battleground state swarmed with political operators before the November presidential election and armed vigilantes responding to the racial justice protests in August after footage of Blake’s police shooting went viral.Weeks before the election, two men used fake identities to pose as documentary filmmakers and organizers to set up video and in-person meetings with staffers at progressive groups, including Lang’s. In the meetings, the men asked suspiciously leading questions and tried to bait activists on camera into agreeing to illegally register voters. Alarmed, the activists eventually compared photos of the men and determined that they were actually associated with Project Veritas, the far-right group founded by conservative activist James O’Keefe, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.The six groups wrote a 21-page letter last September to the state’s attorney general, Josh Kaul, that detailed what it claimed were Project Veritas’s attempts to misrepresent their work to federal election officials dating back to 2016. The letter called on the state’s Department of Justice to investigate the matter.The Rittenhouse shooting and acquittal in November signaled that vigilante violence was not just a real threat, but permissible under the law.After the scare with Project Veritas, Lang began working with Equality Labs, a civil rights organization that specializes in digital security. In recent years, the group has found itself more in demand from outfits like Lang’s — small community groups with even smaller budgets and very little infrastructure to manage such threats.The atmosphere changed dramatically in 2020, when COVID-19 lockdowns began and more people were sequestered at home in front of computers. That year, the Equality Labs saw a 600 percent increase in the number of activists reaching out for help scrubbing their phone numbers, addresses, and other personal data from the internet, according to Thenmozhi Soundararajan, its executive director.“In some places there’s an open door between far-right actors and police,” Soundarajan said.In 2017, the Brennan Center for Justice called the government’s response to established links between law enforcement and racist radical groups “strikingly insufficient.”“They’re not calling the police in a moment where they feel unsafe and unsure,” said Jennifer Epps-Addison, a Milwaukee native and co–executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy.Before COVID safety requirements restricted how often people went into the office, it was not uncommon, Lang said, for a police cruiser to slowly drive by, or pull up behind an organizer’s car and run their license plates. The Movement for Black Lives, the umbrella organization that includes Black Lives Matter, said that it saw an “unprecedented federalization” of protest-related prosecutions” in 2020 under the direction of Donald Trump’s Justice Department that led to 326 criminal cases against protestors for alleged acts such as arson, civil disorder, or assaulting an officer. In 83% of cases, charges were brought in cities with Democratic leadership, the activists found, including places like Portland, Oregon, which made up 20% of federal charges brought against activists during that protest period. Advertisement     Melina Abdullah, a leader with Black Lives Matter, had Los Angeles Police Department officers surround her home twice in recent years. The LAPD announced days before the Rittenhouse verdict that it had traced both incidents back to three teenagers, ages 13 to 16, who were driven by “racial hatred” to make phony emergency calls to law enforcement. The police said the teens were responsible for 30 fake emergency calls. “Even if what they’re saying is true, the police — LAPD — used this as an opportunity to terrorize me and my family,” Abdullah later told the Los Angeles Times.In the meantime, Lang and other activists whose political educations happened alongside and sometimes on social media, have walked a tightrope between being highly visible and digitally less traceable. Soundararajan’s group advises people to cover any tattoos or identifying marks when they attend protests to avoid being targeted by police or white supremacists. Other activists encourage white allies to attend protests so that police respond less aggressively to the crowd.“I imagine that my children’s children will read about this moment in history books in the same way that we read about our forebears during the civil rights movement,” Epps-Addison said. “And wonder why they were allowed to turn fire hoses on people.” ●

A prosecutor has filed involuntary manslaughter charges against the parents of Ethan Crumbley, the Michigan school shooting suspect who allegedly killed four fellow students and wounded seven others with a gun his dad bought days before.James and Jennifer Crumbley each face four counts of involuntary manslaughter. They pleaded not guilty to all charges at their arraignment Saturday, and a judge set a $500,000 bond each for the couple.The couple was arrested early Saturday in Detroit, after officials, including the FBI and US Marshals Service, launched an extensive search for their whereabouts.Oakland County Undersheriff Michael McCabe said a business owner saw Jennifer Crumbley near a car in a parking lot. She ""fled on foot"" after the business owner called 911, and after a search involving Detroit police and K-9 units, the couple was found and arrested. Advertisement     Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard said at a press conference Saturday that the couple was found in an art studio in a warehouse building.They were booked into the Oakland County Jail shortly before 3 a.m., records show. All three family members are being held in the same facility but are individually isolated from each other, Bouchard said. He couldn’t clarify whether or not Ethan Crumbley, the shooting suspect, knew that his parents had been arrested.Bouchard said the location where the Crumbleys were discovered “suggests they weren’t planning on surrendering.”“If there’s no culpability, why would you go be in a warehouse in Detroit?” he said. “We believe they were assisted in that location, to get there and get in. We're gathering information and will present that to our prosecutor for potential charges for either aiding and abetting, or obstruction of justice.""Bouchard first told CNN that the couple was missing Friday after warrants of their arrest were issued, and detectives were told that the couple had stopped returning their attorney's calls and texts.Shannon Smith and Mariell Lehman, their attorneys, denied that they were fleeing from authorities, telling BuzzFeed News on Friday that the Crumbleys had left Oxford on Tuesday night ""for their own safety.""""They are returning to the area to be arraigned,"" they said. ""They are not fleeing from law enforcement despite recent comments in media reports.""Lehman, however, ignored questions asking when they had last been in contact with their clients, or when the couple planned to contact law enforcement or prosecutors to be arraigned.They missed their 4 p.m. arraignment on Friday, and the US Marshals later released wanted posters of the couple and announced a $10,000 reward for information that would lead to their arrest.
 


During a press conference earlier on Friday, Oakland County prosecutor Karen McDonald said the extraordinary step of filing charges against the suspected shooter's parents was taken to hold responsible those who had ""contributed"" to the incident. Advertisement     ""These charges are intended to hold the individuals who contributed to this tragedy accountable, and also send the message that gun owners have a responsibility,"" she said. ""They failed to uphold that responsibility.""Four students — Tate Myre, Hana St. Juliana, Madisyn Baldwin, and Justin Shilling — were killed in the shooting at Oxford High School on Tuesday. Seven others were injured, including a teacher.It is rare for parents of a mass shooting suspect to be charged in a case. Each involuntary manslaughter count carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.At the press conference Friday, the prosecutor laid out the parents' alleged role that led to the shooting, beginning with the 15-year-old suspect accompanying his dad to buy a SIG Sauer 9mm on Friday, Nov. 26. The day after, his mother posted on social media, ""Mom and son day testing out his new Christmas present,"" McDonald said.Prior to the day of the shooting, a teacher at Oxford High saw the suspect looking up ammunition on his phone during class and reported it to school officials, McDonald said. A call from the school to his mother went to voicemail, and officials indicated that they followed up with an email, but neither parent responded.However, investigators discovered that the mother had texted the suspect about being contacted by the school that day, writing, ""lol I'm not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught.""On the morning of the shooting, another teacher found a note on the suspect's desk that had a drawing of a handgun, a bullet, and a bleeding person with what appeared to be two gunshot wounds, McDonald said.The words ""The thoughts won't stop help me"" and ""Blood everywhere"" were also on the note. At the bottom, there was a drawing of a laughing emoji, as well as the quotes that said, ""My life is useless"" and ""The world is dead.""The teacher who found the note was so alarmed that she took a photo of it on her phone. The Crumbleys were again summoned to the school. A school counselor called the suspect in with his backpack — but by that time, he had already altered the drawings and scratched some parts out, McDonald said. Advertisement     Investigators believe the gun that was used in the shooting — the same gun bought on Friday — was in the suspect's backpack during the meeting.The suspect's parents were shown the note and advised to get their son into counseling within 48 hours.""Both James and Jennifer Crumbley failed to ask their son if he had his gun with him or where his gun was located, and failed to inspect his backpack for the presence of the gun, which he had with him,"" McDonald said.They also ""resisted the idea ... of their son leaving the school at that time,"" she said, adding that the parents left school grounds by themselves while the 15-year-old went back to class.After news outlets reported a shooting at Oxford High, which authorities said happened shortly before 1 p.m., the mother texted her son at 1:22 p.m., saying, ""Ethan, don't do it.""Fifteen minutes later, the father called 911 to report that his gun was missing and that his son may have been the school shooter. McDonald said that once the father heard about the shooting at the school, he drove home to look for his gun.Tim Throne, the school district superintendent, acknowledged in a video Thursday that the suspect ""did have contact"" with the front office and that his parents were on school grounds the day of the shooting. But, he said, ""No discipline was warranted. There are no discipline records at the high school.""Throne did not immediately respond to questions about why the suspect's behavior did not warrant disciplinary measures.The Crumbleys' attorneys said Saturday morning that they ""intend to fight this case in the courtroom and not in the court of public opinion.""""The charges in this case are intended to make an example and send a message,"" they said, adding that the prosecution ""cherry- picked and slanted specific facts to further their narrative to do that.""
 


McDonald was critical of Michigan's lax gun laws in her Friday press conference, calling them ""woefully inadequate."" She also said the Crumbleys failed to bear the responsibility of owning a gun.""I'm not here to say that people shouldn't own guns. I know a lot of people who own guns — but they do so responsibly,"" McDonald said. ""And it's your responsibility, it's your duty to make sure that you don't give access to this deadly weapon to somebody that you have reason to believe is going to harm someone.""McDonald brought charges against the parents because ""the facts of the case are so egregious,"" she said, pointing to the parents' knowledge of the suspect's behavior before the shooting.""The notion that a parent could read those words [on the note] and also know that their son had access to a deadly weapon that they gave him is unconscionable,"" McDonald said. ""And I think it's criminal.""The 15-year-old was charged Wednesday with one count of terrorism causing death, four counts of first-degree murder, seven counts of assault with intent to murder, and 12 counts of possession of a firearm in commitment of a felony. He will be tried as an adult and could be sentenced to life in prison.He has pleaded not guilty.All three Crumbley family members are on suicide watch “out of an abundance of caution,” although Bouchard said Saturday there weren’t any specific indicators that any of them were suicidal.

For influencers to attract sponsorship opportunities, the photos on their feeds need to look polished. That extra glisten comes from hiring professionals — which in turn has changed the photography industry.This week I spoke to Julia D’Agostino, a 25-year-old photographer based in Stamford, Connecticut, who works mainly with lifestyle and fashion influencers. “My first ever postcollege client was actually an influencer — I jumped right into the world,” she told me. She now has a growing Instagram account to feature photos she takes of social media creators (such as Eva Amurri of @thehappilyeva, a lifestyle blogger and Instagram influencer with over 189,000 followers), and also to modestly start building her own personal brand online, which is a fascinating new layer to all of this.Julia said lifestyle shoots have changed subtly, but in very revealing ways, over the last few years. In, say, 2015, a standard fashion shoot with an influencer client would be fairly formulaic. “We were primarily styling outfits and photographing them in a cool location,” she told me. “I would photograph the shoes up close, grab a detail of a bag, a nice shot of the headband, make sure to grab a full-body image as well.”Today, because her clients are open to all kinds of spon, things are more complicated. Her job is a meticulous game of making sure the necessary products are featured, but that she, and the influencer, are then not intentionally pushing other products in a photo. Advertisement     Often Julia is working to highlight multiple items — say, a soap, a blanket, or a battery — while shooting at a specific location and keeping the background clear of any other brands. The whole time they’re trying to ensure that it “still reads as a lifestyle image without coming across as a true #ad,” she said.Because influencers and photographers are often self-employed, their unique business relationship is usually one that has to be mutually beneficial.“Most of the time when both sides of the stick are new to the game, there’s always a trade in mind to help each other out, which I love,” she added. “I think it’s great for everyone to learn from one another.”The work also fosters an intimacy that she’s really grown to appreciate, especially over the last two years. “When I’m photographing with influencers, especially through COVID, I am invited into so many different homes and families,” Julia said. “I know their husbands, their children, even their own parents. It’s a very personal world. Sometimes we take a 15-min therapy sesh while changing outfits in the car — we style together, we brainstorm together, we get through it together.”
 


As much as the influencer industry has created more jobs for photographers, there are new hurdles too. Common learning curves for influencers are best crediting practices and navigating image rights. It can feel intuitive that if a photo is of you, that you retain some rights to it. Influencers can accidentally issue rights to use their image freely, when that picture actually belongs to the photographer. Julia reminded us that a good, collaborative relationship between creator and curator means drafting up a clear contract — and setting the standard for proper photo practices. For one, always credit the photographer, like @thehappilyeva frequently does, in the post caption. Advertisement     “I think the digital age is a challenge for everyone to understand copyright and the buying and selling and usage of imagery,” Julia said. “If you’re just starting as a photographer, it’s always a good idea to create a contract with your lawyer. If you’re just starting as an influencer, it’s always a good idea to credit your photographer if they require that for the usage of their imagery. This also includes passing along their photo credit information if you are sharing their image with another brand.”Her unforeseen career trajectory to working exclusively with influencers has also made Julia respect how tough a gig it is. She gets particularly miffed when so many people on the internet disparage her clients’ livelihoods, since she’s seen firsthand how much effort goes into a photo shoot.“I’ve known from day one how difficult it is to be an influencer,” Julia told me.Influencers are putting themselves in “the most vulnerable place” when they’re posing in front of a camera and conceiving how they want to narrativize their brand, Julia said.“There’s so many people out there who throw comments around like ‘I can be an influencer,’” she said. “Well, OK, then do it, and I’ll be there to cheer you on the whole way.”Over the last three years she’s worked with Eva, Julia said she’s grown to appreciate how tough-skinned women creators have to be to continue to talk about extremely personal facets of their lives and motherhood, in order to generate revenue — and keep supporting her own business. It’s a paradigm that deserves to be examined and also appreciated.“Eva shares her life with everyone,” Julia said. “She tells everyone about her highs, lows, her stories, her own life lessons, and listens back to everyone’s feedback.”The reason you and I, and others, are not actively pursuing an influencer career is exactly because that work is particularly onerous. And it’s why some of us prefer to be behind a camera, or a computer screen, capturing and writing about influencers instead. Advertisement     Until next time,Tanya

374,Emily Ratajkowski opened up about the complicated process of speaking out about sexual assault in her new book.,"Emily Ratajkowski has opened up about the complicated process of speaking out about sexual assault in her new book of essays, My Body. Speaking to BuzzFeed News during a live event in London on Nov. 30, Emily addressed the conflicting emotions she had about going public with her experiences — particularly the accusations she made against Robin Thicke. In early October — prior to the official release of her book last month — an excerpt from an essay in which she alleged that she was groped by the singer was leaked against her will. Within the excerpt, which was taken from a much longer essay titled “Blurred Lines,” Emily writes about the complications of power and consent in the modeling industry and recalls a specific experience on the set of the music video for Thicke’s hit song that the essay is named after. As you may know, Emily was launched to fame after she starred in the hugely popular 2013 music video for “Blurred Lines,” performed by Thicke, Pharrell Williams, and T.I. “Blurred Lines” wound up being one of the most popular, and polarizing, hits of 2013, and ultimately held the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 for a total of 12 weeks after its debut. The track — which has been widely criticized for its problematic lyrics that seemingly perpetuate rape culture — has two accompanying music videos: one censored, and another uncensored version in which Emily and two other models appear topless. Emily has since publicly distanced herself from the controversial videos, and in 2015 she called her involvement in the project “the bane of [her] existence.” Writing about her experience on the set of the uncensored version of the video, Emily said: “Suddenly, out of nowhere, I felt the coolness and foreignness of a stranger’s hands cupping my bare breasts from behind. I instinctively moved away, looking back at Robin Thicke.” “He smiled a goofy grin and stumbled backward, his eyes concealed behind his sunglasses,” she goes on. “My head turned to the darkness beyond the set. [Director Diane Martel’s] voice cracked as she yelled out to me, ‘Are you okay?’” Two days after the passage was leaked, Emily spoke of her frustration, explaining that her accusations had been misinterpreted without the context of the larger essay from which they were lifted. “It’s been hard for me, I really like to have control over my image and I wrote this book of essays to share the whole story and all sides of it,” she said at a red carpet event in early October. “I feel like it turns into a clickbait frenzy and all of a sudden words like ‘sexual assault’ and ‘allegations’ are getting thrown around rather than people reading the actual essay.” Speaking to BuzzFeed News during a live conversation about her book on Tuesday, Emily addressed the public response to her accusations once again and revealed that she had initially been hesitant to share her experience over fears of being misunderstood. “So I didn’t want to write that essay,” she began, before explaining that it had been her editor who encouraged her to delve deeper into the experience. “I had that anecdote about what happened on the set in another essay,” the author explained. “And my editor said to me: ‘This speaks to so much of what you’re talking about in the other chapters; why have you never talked about this moment that happened on set? Why don’t you write about it more?’” Emily went on to detail the “agonizing” process of putting her experiences into words and expressed her concerns that she would be accused of “capitalizing” off of the controversial “Blurred Lines” video that she had tried to distance herself from. “I went through several drafts and I realized that I was agonizing over it because I knew that it was going to be made into this thing that I didn’t want to be known for,” she said, seemingly referencing her hopes of detaching herself from the 2013 music video. “[I knew] that it would be turned into this moment of, you know: ‘Emily Ratajkowski is capitalizing off of her moment of fame,’” she added. She then disclosed that the full essay was originally intended to be published as a stand-alone piece prior to the release of the full book. However, the actor went on to reveal that the “frustrating” responses to the leaked excerpt prompted her to reevaluate this. “I knew that was what was going to happen,” Emily said, speaking of the public reaction to the initial passage. “The essay was meant to be published ahead of the book,” she revealed. “And after the news leaked, there was this push to kind of edit — it’s quite a long essay — and they wanted to edit it down.” “I sort of decided that I didn’t want it to be published at all,” she said, implying that the scale of people’s misinterpretations highlighted the importance of the wider context of the entire book. “Hopefully, maybe one day they’ll read the book and understand that I was trying to say something more,” she concluded. Elsewhere during Tuesday’s live conversation, host Pandora Sykes recounted the various instances of alleged misconduct that are detailed throughout Emily’s book and asked the model whether she found retelling the stories to be “cathartic, traumatizing, or both.” In response, Emily detailed the complicated emotions she encountered when it came to labeling her experiences as “sexual assault” and explained that it initially made her “nervous” to hear them being branded as such. “I didn’t think I was writing about sexual assault when I was writing about these experiences,” she began. “Even initially when the Cut essay came out, I felt very nervous when people started using that language,” Emily explained, referring to her first stand-alone essay, “Buying Myself Back,” in which she claimed to have been sexually assaulted by a photographer named Jonathan Leder during a photo shoot at his home in 2012. “There were so many very specific connotations to that [type of language],” she said. “I think it becomes this idea of, you picture someone cutting themselves open and bleeding, and pointing fingers at people, and I didn’t want that to be what happened.” She went on to clarify, “I just was writing about experiences that I have shame around, and felt genuinely confused about … It was more about trying to understand how these things happened.” The author concluded by expressing that she doesn’t deem the men who allegedly abused her to be “bad guys,” but rather considers them to be “victims of a culture that made them feel insecure.” “What’s interesting is that even comparing that list of different experiences I’ve had, I still don’t think like ‘Oh, those are bad guys,’” Emily explained. “I really sort of feel like all those people were victims of a culture that made them feel insecure, and made them feel like they had to grab power back. And they didn’t respect women’s boundaries and bodies.” Interestingly, these comments come just a few weeks after Emily revealed that she hasn’t heard from Thicke since her accusations were first leaked nearly two months ago. During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live on Nov. 11, host Andy Cohen asked the model if she had spoken to Thicke since she shared her experience from the set of the “Blurred Lines” shoot. After first clarifying that she had had “a great time” on the set of the music video despite her claims, Emily confirmed that she was yet to hear from the singer in the wake of her accusations. In response, Andy asked if she had expected to hear from him, which prompted the author to clarify her reasoning for sharing her experience with the public. “No,” she said about whether she had been anticipating a response from Thicke. “The essay wasn't written as a gotcha moment. It's about me sort of setting the record straight and sharing the whole truth and my experience with the world.”"

“It was so weird because I was like, ’It’s not a new style, it's one thing I wore and then I’m gonna wear this another day and then I’m gonna do this,’” she said. “Literally the thing that I’ve been preaching about since I first started is to wear what you want.“Dress how you want, act how you want, talk how you want, be how you want.

376,Pregnant women face a risk of being murdered 16% higher than women the same age who are not pregnant.,"


A woman in Houston who showed an ultrasound to her boyfriend, a mother of five who was carrying a sixth child, and a pregnant woman coming home from a baby shower were all recent victims of homicide, a top cause of death for pregnant people in the US.Pregnant people are more than twice as likely to be murdered during pregnancy and immediately after giving birth than to die from any other cause, according to a nationwide death certificate study. Homicide far exceeds obstetric causes of death during pregnancy, such as hemorrhage, hypertension, or infection. Advertisement     Nationwide, there were around 10,000 homicides reported last year, according to FBI statistics, and only 1 in 5 victims were female. But pregnant women face a risk of being murdered 16% higher than women the same age who are not pregnant, the recently released Obstetrics & Gynecology journal study concludes. (The paper focused on people identified as female based on their death certificate.)This new nationwide analysis was enabled by a change in how death certificates are recorded. As of 2017, certificates in all states now have a checkbox for “pregnancy.”Investigators looked at all deaths among women ages 10 to 44 held in a federal database from 2018 and 2019. They found 273 homicides of pregnant women, which make up almost 6% of all murdered women in the US. Most of them were shot at home; guns were involved in 7 out of 10 such homicides, an increase from past decades.“It is surprising to many people,” said study author Veronica Gillispie-Bell, medical director of the Louisiana Perinatal Quality Collaborative. An earlier finding that homicide was a leading cause of death for pregnant people in her state, followed by overdoses and car crashes, led the study’s team to look nationwide. “We wanted to see if pregnancy, in and of itself, was a more dangerous time, and it was.” Advertisement     Though it is well understood by victims of domestic violence, the danger that pregnant people face — often from their partners — receives little public notice.""We have shouted it out for years, but no one is really paying attention,"" Jacquelyn Campbell, an intimate partner violence researcher at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, told BuzzFeed News. ""We have to do a better job of assessing the lethal risks to pregnant women.""According to the study, homicide rates were particularly high among pregnant women 24 and younger, and for pregnant Black women, who were three times more at risk than their white counterparts. That mirrors the overall risk of dying during pregnancy from all causes, including obstetric ones, which is about 2.5 times higher for Black people, pointing to an overall lack of access to healthcare and, in turn, screening for domestic violence. The racial gap in US wealth also plays a role, as studies have found a link between poverty and intimate partner violence.“All of this means we need to look beyond the hospital for what is really a risk to women,” Gillispie-Bell said. Simply screening for domestic violence doesn’t help if there aren’t resources to assist with jobs, housing, and other reasons that people stay in dangerous relationships.The homicide finding mirrors two decades of past reports, Campbell said, and it’s still likely a conservative estimate because death records are often incomplete. Part of the reason that the murder statistic is relatively unknown, she added, lies in the way that maternal deaths are reported in the US. Medical causes such as hemorrhage are considered ""related"" to pregnancy, while homicide, overdose, and suicide, other leading causes of death in pregnant people, are merely ""associated"" with pregnancy in federal statistics.Causes of death that are “related” and “associated” with pregnancy are reported separately, and medical boards tend to focus on the former, believing they can be solved by medical professionals.A general explanation for the higher homicide risk that pregnant people face at this time is that their relationships face heightened stress, which might exacerbate an already dangerous situation. “Nobody who works in intimate partner violence will be surprised by this finding,” said Penn State’s Penelope Morrison, an assistant professor of biobehavioral health. However, she added, specific risk factors for homicide during pregnancy beyond a history of intimate partner violence aren’t well established. Advertisement     “Sadly, we cannot hear from the women what happened,” she said.The US homicide rate rose by 30% in 2020, which has experts worried about the trend for pregnant people in the pandemic.“We expect that domestic violence has only gotten worse during the pandemic, with people more confined,” Gillispie-Bell said. “We expect we will see this has only gotten worse.”

377,One of the four accusers in Ghislane Maxwell’s sex trafficking trial shared graphic details in court over two days.,"


The first alleged victim testified in Ghislaine Maxwell’s federal trial this week, sharing in graphic, emotional detail how Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused her from when she was 14 to 16.Maxwell was the former girlfriend and longtime associate of Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender, whose August 2019 death in prison — where he was awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges — was ruled a suicide. Federal prosecutors have accused Maxwell of being Epstein’s “partner in crime” who made it possible for him to sexually abuse and traffic underage girls for a decade. If convicted, she could face up to 70 years in prison. Advertisement     The testimony of four women who said they were abused while underage is central to the case against Maxwell, with two of the women alleging that she recruited them when they were only 14 years old.On Tuesday, the first of the four accusers testified, describing how Maxwell allegedly groomed her for sexual acts with Epstein, while at times actively participating in the abuse. She also testified Wednesday that Epstein introduced her to Donald Trump at his Florida resort Mar-a-Lago when she was 14, before he was president.The witness, who was identified in court by the pseudonym “Jane” and who is now in her early 40s, said she first met Maxwell and Epstein in 1994 while she was attending a summer arts camp in Michigan. Epstein told her they were major donors to the camp and that they gave children scholarships. After finding out she was from Palm Beach, Florida, where he had a home, he suggested he might know her parents and asked for her mom’s name and phone number, Jane saidWeeks later, at the beginning of her eighth-grade year, Jane’s mother told her that Epstein had called and invited them to tea.That meeting was the first of many for Jane. Jane testified that she began regularly visiting Epstein and Maxwell — without her mom — and the two often took her shopping or to the movies. Epstein frequently gave her wads of cash, she said, and they asked her about her life, her family, and her dreams. Soon, Maxwell felt akin to an “older sister,” she said. Advertisement     But that same year, while she was still 14, Epstein began sexually abusing her, Jane said. Maxwell played a significant role, she said, allegedly grooming her by normalizing talking about sexual topics, goading the young teen into sexual contact with Epstein and, at times, Maxwell herself.“It made me feel confused because that did not feel normal to me,” Jane said in her testimony Tuesday. “When you’re 14, you have no idea what’s going on.”
 


The first time Epstein sexually abused her was in his pool house, Jane said, adding that he pulled his pants down and began masturbating on her. After he was finished, he cleaned himself up in the bathroom and acted like nothing had happened, she said.“I was frozen in fear,” she said. “I’d never seen a penis before, let alone not seen anything like this.”Jane told the court that she was too frightened and ashamed to tell anyone about what had happened to her. She continued seeing Epstein and Maxwell, who she said would often instruct her in how to sexually gratify Epstein. According to Jane, Maxwell also had sexual contact with her. They would perform a variety of sex acts with Jane, including orgies, and the alleged abuse continued until she was 16, Jane said.On Wednesday, Jane testified that she had taken part in the Trump-run Miss Teen USA beauty pageant in 1998 and that she had been introduced to him by Epstein in the 1990s at Mar-a-Lago. She did not describe any improper conduct during the meeting or offer other details about it. Advertisement     Maxwell has been charged with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, sex trafficking conspiracy, and sex trafficking of a minor. She has pleaded not guilty.Maxwell’s defense lawyers have attempted to depict her as an innocent party, suggesting she’s being treated as a “scapegoat” since Epstein is no longer alive to stand trial.“Ever since Eve was accused of tempting Adam with the apple, women have been blamed for the bad behavior of men,"" her lawyer, Bobbi Sternheim, said in her opening statement.But federal prosecutors say Maxwell was an active participant in Epstein’s “pyramid scheme” of sexual abuse, recruiting, grooming, and arranging travel for the young girls so they could be victimized.“For a decade, the defendant played an essential role in the scheme,” Assistant US Attorney Lara Pomerantz said in her opening statement. “She knew exactly what she was doing — she was dangerous.”Defense attorneys, however, have described the alleged victims as troubled women and liars out for money. Jane, who received $5 million from the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Fund, was accused by Sternheim of only getting involved in the case when “money was on the line,” and he suggested her work as an actor made her a “pro at playing roles.”When asked what the money she received from the Epstein victims fund meant to her, an emotional Jane said, ""I wish I would have never received that money in the first place because of what happened.”She said that was speaking out to ""finally find some closure to all this.""""Hopefully this just puts it all to an end and I can move on with my life,"" Jane said.

378,Law enforcement officials said evidence recovered from the suspected shooter’s cellphone includes a video the teen made of himself where “he talked about shooting and killing students the next day.”,"


The 15-year-old who allegedly brought a gun to his Michigan high school and opened fire, killing four people and injuring seven more, has been charged with 24 crimes, including terrorism and first-degree murder, a county prosecutor announced Wednesday.The Oxford High School sophomore faces one count of terrorism causing death, four counts of first-degree murder, seven counts of assault with intent to murder, and 12 counts of possession of a firearm in commitment of a felony. He will be tried as an adult and could be sentenced to life in prison. Advertisement     Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald and law enforcement officials on Wednesday said that they have found evidence to suggest that the suspected shooter, identified as Ethan Crumbley, planned the attack and purposefully set out to kill students.Evidence from the suspected shooter's cellphone includes two separate videos the teenager made the night before the incident ""wherein he talked about shooting and killing students the next day at Oxford High School,"" Oakland County Sheriff's Lt. Tim Willis said in an arraignment hearing.A journal was also recovered from the suspect's backpack detailing his desire to ""shoot up the school to include murdering students,"" Willis said.""There are facts leading up to the shooting that suggest this was not an impulsive act,"" McDonald said. ""We have charged four counts of first-degree murder, which require premeditation. And I am absolutely sure after reviewing the evidence that it isn’t even a close call. It was absolutely premeditated."" Advertisement     In a press conference yesterday, Oakland County Undersheriff Michael McCabe said police were notified of an active shooter situation at Oxford High School at approximately 12:51 p.m. on Tuesday. Crumbley was arrested approximately five minutes after the first call came in, he said. Law enforcement has identified the victims as Tate Myre, 16, Hana St. Juliana, 14, Madisyn Baldwin, 17, and Justin Shilling, 17.McDonald said that the terrorism charges were appropriate in this case because of the number of people who have been affected by the crime in addition to the four dead and seven injured.""What about the children who ran, screaming, hiding under desks?"" McDonald said. ""What about all the children at home right now who can’t eat and can’t sleep and can’t imagine a world where they could ever set foot back in that school? Those are victims too and so are their families and so is the community and the charge of terrorism reflects that.""In a press conference Wednesday, Sheriff Michael Bouchard said that the school had raised concerns about the 15-year-old the day before and the day of the shooting for ""behavior in the classroom that they felt was concerning.""Although he declined to provide details on the behavior that prompted this concern, Bouchard said that teenager and his parents had a ""face-to-face"" meeting with school officials Tuesday — mere hours before the shooting.The gun used in the attack was purchased by Crumbley's father four days beforehand, and Bouchard said that an investigation into the alleged shooter's parents is ongoing.McDonald told reporters that charges may be filed against the shooter's parents depending on the results of that investigation. ""We know that owning a gun means securing it properly and locking it and keeping the ammunition separate,"" she said.The suspected shooter has invoked his right to remain silent and has yet to talk to law enforcement.A Michigan judge on Wednesday ordered that the suspected shooter be moved from a juvenile facility to county jail. She denied bond.

379,Opening statements took place Wednesday in the trial of the former reality star. This story contains descriptions of child sexual abuse materials.,"


FAYETTEVILLE, Arkansas — Former 19 Kids and Counting reality star Josh Duggar downloaded images and video on a work computer of children as young as 7 years old being “abused,” “violated,” and “exploited,” federal prosecutors said in opening statements on Wednesday.The jury heard graphic descriptions on Wednesday of the materials from prosecutors, while Duggar’s defense maintained the 33-year-old didn’t have the technical knowledge to discreetly browse the illegal content found on the computer. Duggar, the oldest child of his famous fundamentalist Christian family, was arrested in Arkansas in April and charged with “knowingly” receiving and possessing child sexual abuse materials. He pleaded not guilty on both counts. He faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for each count if he is convicted. Advertisement     “Hold him accountable,” US Assistant Attorney Dustin Roberts said Wednesday in his opening statement, looking at the jury and pointing at Duggar, who appeared in court but did not speak. His wife, Anna Duggar, sat in the gallery.According to prosecutors, Duggar used a device that virtually “split” his HP desktop work computer into “two independent sides,” allowing him to use the computer at the used car dealership’s “shed-like” office for usual business purposes on one side while browsing illegal content on the other.In one case, Duggar downloaded a series of images titled “Marissa.zip” which featured a girl about 8 years old exposing her genitals before eventually being put in a cage, Roberts said.Defense attorney Justin Gelfand argued that Duggar didn’t have the knowledge to install the sophisticated software found on his work computer. He suggested someone else was responsible, describing the case as an “old-fashioned whodunit.”The defense also blamed government investigators for moving slowly to investigate the illegal activity — which law enforcement software detected in May 2019 but was not flagged by officials until June 2019. According to the defense, law enforcement unfairly associated the activity with Duggar before exploring all other potential avenues, such as his coworkers. Advertisement     The first witness for the prosecution was Detective Amber Kalmer, who first began to investigate the child sexual abuse activity in June 2019.She testified on Wednesday that she was able to download portions of the content recorded by her surveillance software. One video she saw contained “two prepubescent females, zoomed in on their vaginal areas, being penetrated by an adult man’s penis,” she said. Kalmer added she was also able to view images of nude young girls with a “focus on the vaginal area.” There were 65 images.When she first reviewed the content in June 2019, she told the court she didn’t assume the activity was associated with any particular individual — she only had an IP address in Springdale, Arkansas, and alerted a law enforcement colleague there, who agreed to start an investigation. Law enforcement were able to ask the internet service provider who was connected with the specific IP address, leading them to Duggar, she said.Federal officials seized Duggar’s iPhone, MacBook, and HP desktop computer at the dealership, among other devices, via search warrant in November 2019. The devices were sent to Washington, DC, for review, prosecutors said, and investigators found that Duggar used what is known as a peer-to-peer network on his desktop computer at his business, Wholesale Motorcars.These networks involve devices connecting directly to other computers or servers, which allows for easy exchange of files to download or share. These systems are known by law enforcement to be a common way child sexual abuse material is distributed, prosecutors said.On Wednesday, Homeland Security Investigator Gerald Faulkner testified that he received files from Kalmer in June 2019 and, after obtaining information from internet service provider OzarksGo, went on to obtain the search warrant for Wholesale Motorcars. Duggar, one employee, and one customer were present on the car lot on Nov. 8, 2019, and when agents arrived, they told him only that they were seeking “evidential” items that could contain “digital contraband” and confiscated his phone.About 15 minutes later, Faulkner and another agent approached Duggar again to come to their vehicle to discuss the search warrant — which he still had not been told had to do with child sexual abuse materials, prosecutors noted. Advertisement     Once in the vehicle, Faulkner said Duggar asked them, “So what guys, someone downloading child porn?”Agents then read Duggar his Miranda rights and asked for consent to record their conversation. Three excerpts of the 51-minute conversation were played in court on Wednesday. The conversation was practically friendly: the three men laughed at points, and Duggar sounded calm. He expressed understanding, “respect,” and gratitude at multiple points to the agents for their work in law enforcement.In one clip, Duggar confirmed OzarksGo was his internet provider and that his iPhone, MacBook, and HP desktop were the three devices on the car lot in addition to two surveillance cameras and a few thumb drives. He said these devices had passwords but that his wife and children frequently access his devices.In another, the agents asked whether Duggar is familiar with peer-to-peer networks. Duggar said he was and that he had used these networks on all three of his devices.In another clip, the agents finally told Duggar they work to protect children from exploitation, to which he thanked the agents for their work.He then asked, “Is that what you’re saying is going on?”The officers replied there’s “pieces to the puzzle that might save children” present at the car lot.“Did something happen on my devices...Did it mark this IP address?” Duggar asked, adding he’s seen no “red flags” that would alert him of something like child sexual exploitation material being downloaded at his business.In the third clip, the agents told Duggar they had information pointing out that someone at the property had been downloading illegal content.“We don’t want to speculate,” one told Duggar, adding they want to figure out how the car lot became linked to the illegal downloads on a peer-to-peer program.“Appreciate what you guys do,” Duggar replied. “I don’t want to say that I’m guilty or not of accessing inappropriate content at some point of my life.”Duggar was released from jail in May after a virtual federal detention hearing and ordered to stay with third-party custodians, LaCount and Maria Reber, who are family friends. The court mandated that he not view or possess any pornography or erotica “of any kind,” nor is he permitted to access the internet on any kind of device. He has to wear a GPS monitoring device and is only permitted to see his children in the presence of their mother — although contact with any other minor is prohibited, according to court records.

The trial comes just days after his wife announced the birth of their seventh child on Nov. 16. His father, Jim Bob Duggar, also recently announced he is running for Arkansas state Senate. He and his wife, Michelle Duggar, have called the allegations against their son “very serious” and “continue to pray” for Josh and Anna’s family.Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, who became famous for their large household and ultraconservative beliefs via the TLC reality show and spinoffs, admitted in a 2015 Fox News interview that Josh Duggar had molested five girls when he was a teenager, including his four younger sisters and a family babysitter. In the interview, they said he and the girls received counseling and the family did not believe there was any future threat of wrongdoing; in their view, he had only been “curious about girls.”Duggar apologized in a May 2015 statement to People magazine, saying, “Twelve years ago, as a young teenager, I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret. I hurt others, including my family and close friends.”In an evidentiary hearing Monday, Duggar’s lawyers argued testimony from Jim Bob Duggar as well as the parents of a girl Josh Duggar is accused of molesting, should be kept confidential during the trial under “clergy privilege” — meaning they should be exempt because they are church leaders. Advertisement     “The clergy privilege — also referred to as the priest-penitent privilege or the religious privilege — is a firmly rooted privilege that shields certain communications from disclosure,” Duggar’s lawyers said in a brief filed Tuesday.The judge on Wednesday denied that motion and allowed prosecutors to show the jury evidence of Duggar's prior child molestation.

380,“The idea of making a chronicle of such violence to the earth set the course for much of my future work.”,"


David Maisel started out studying architecture, but a chance encounter with a photobook vendor on the streets of New York changed the course of his career forever. His topographical images of landscapes going through violent environmental changes look abstract from a distance, and then once you get a little bit closer, the toll on the landscape is impossible to unsee. When he began taking aerial photographs from helicopters of open pit mining sites and extensive logging in the American West in the 1980s, many people, from the art world to the Environmental Protection Agency, were struggling with taking the rising threats to the environment seriously.Now, Maisel's work feels more prescient and urgent than ever. On the heels of COP26, the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow that has been criticized for failing to produce tangible, effective promises to limit greenhouse gases, these photos are undeniable proof of how much irretrievable damage we have already done to the planet. Maisel's show at the Edwynn Houk Gallery runs through November 20. We spoke with him over email about his travels, COP26, and Mars. Advertisement  
 


When did you first realize that you wanted to photograph the environment and landscape?Because of my work in architecture, I was already concerned with how the human-made world fit into and pushed against the natural world. In the summer of 1983, I accompanied Emmet Gowin on a photographic expedition to the volcano Mount St. Helens. Witnessing the aftermath of the so-called natural disaster of the volcano was fascinating, but what I found most compelling was seeing the scale with which the logging industry was clear-cutting the area. The violence of that activity was deeply disturbing, and the idea of making a chronicle of such violence to the earth set the course for much of my future work.Simultaneously: The preeminent photo historian Peter Bunnell was teaching at Princeton, and through his classes I was able to explore original prints of photographers I found relevant and inspiring, from that of the New Topographics image makers, to that of the exploratory photographers of the 19th century, who showed processes of industrialization in the American West (and notions of Manifest Destiny taking form in the land) and sites of imperialism globally. That work spoke to me both formally and in terms of the politics inherent in these images of human-wrought change to the natural world. Advertisement  In the decades you've been working on this series, how many countries/states in the US have you traveled to?I’ve concentrated my work on many of the western states, and throughout the Rocky Mountain region — Montana, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, California, Arizona, and Alaska. I’ve also made work on clear-cutting in northern Maine. I’ve made extensive projects in Spain, Iceland, and most recently, Chile’s Atacama Desert, where vast lithium and copper mines are impacting this highly sensitive eco-region. What I have felt has been surprise, yes, but also: horror, confusion, despair, revulsion.
 


How has your awareness of the environment changed over the years?In the mid-1980s, when I first began making aerial photographs of open pit mining sites in the American West, there was not much discourse on issues of the environment, especially within the art world. It was almost seen as a throwback — hey, didn’t we cover all this during the 60s with the Ecology Movement? What’s left to discuss? Advertisement  Over time, we’ve collectively come to understand that we are in a precarious place with regards to the environment, and that our own collective actions are responsible for climate change, natural resource depletion, and all the effects that ripple outward from those actions. In terms of my own awareness: when I began making this work in the 1980s, I focused entirely on making pictures within the United States. It was natural for me to start by working in my country of birth, but I also felt hesitant to critique countries where I wasn’t from and hadn’t lived. As time has passed, I feel that it makes sense to consider the global impact of human-wrought change; the challenges we are facing are indeed global. And my work is never intended solely as a criticism of a particular nation; these environmental issues transcend national boundaries.
 


What do you want people to take away from these photographs?We are all complicit in making these damaged sites. I hope the pictures encourage viewers to become more active in placing a higher priority on issues of the environment. Especially living in San Francisco, the effects of climate change over the last few years seems so intense.What are your hopes for the future?Climate change is definitely not an abstract thing “out there.” It is happening at my doorstep. The firestorms in California and throughout the West in the past few years have occurred at an unprecedented scale within recent human history. My hopes for the future are that governments and citizens alike, activists and consumers alike, can embrace the idea of tackling climate change head-on. What does this mean on a personal level? How can we pull back from our usual patterns of consumption? We need to be smarter, we need architects and designers and scientists and artists and philosophers and legislators to build a path forward, and we need new patterns of behavior.That being said, I write this as COP26, the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, is drawing to a close without meeting the necessary goals for substantive change; it’s hard to be hopeful in light of this, but where will we be without hope? Advertisement  What more do you want to do with your work in the future?Mars seems ripe for exploration! On a more earthly realm…since the start of the pandemic, I have been making paintings again, and I’m deeply satisfied by this process. It’s somewhat like working in the darkroom — a series of alchemical explorations, both mysterious and controlled.The paintings are, not surprisingly, abstracted images of landscapes having to do with both memory and environmental degradation — the fires and drought we are experiencing here in the West, especially. In terms of photography…I hope to be able to continue to bear witness and make records of environmental transformation and degradation. I’d like to follow the development of lithium mines around the globe, and to picture the impact that these mines have on their environments. We have embraced lithium as an alternative to fossil fuels and as a way to power our electric cars, our iPhones, etc., but its extraction comes at a terrible cost.

381,'Tis the season (to get a booster before heading home for the holidays),"


When it comes to the biggest health story of the 21st century — COVID-19, of course — there are some glimmers of hope.Although the Delta variant rolled through the US in late summer, pushing cases to levels not seen since early 2021 (with a corresponding rise in the death toll), daily COVID cases and hospitalizations declined in November. Advertisement     But the pandemic is far from over. Given the emergence of the Omicron variant and the fact that COVID has come in waves, some experts are warning that there could be another wave coming this winter. Case numbers began rising again in early December. Deaths, more than 1,000 a day nationwide, and hospitalizations remain at severe levels among the unvaccinated.As people head indoors and vaccine immunity starts to wane — and with the emergence of potentially more transmissible variants like Omicron — cases could climb even higher. That’s led the FDA to authorize booster shots for all people 16 and older to give added protection and help prevent more outbreaks. In January, the agency added 12 to 15 year olds to that authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech shots, a decision the CDC endorsed after an advisory panel vote, opening the door to those kids getting boosters in the US.""We now recommend that all adolescents aged 12-17 years should receive a booster shot 5 months after their primary series,"" said CDC chief Rochelle Walensky, in a statement. ""This booster dose will provide optimized protection against COVID-19 and the Omicron variant.""
 


In November, the FDA first authorized, and a CDC advisory committee endorsed, a recommendation that everyone 18 and older should get a booster if they were vaccinated with a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccine, as should all adults who received the Johnson & Johnson shot.On Dec. 9, the FDA and CDC updated that recommendation to include 16- and 17-year-olds, who can now get a Pfizer booster six months or more after getting the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. (The Pfizer vaccine is the only one currently recommended for children ages 5 and older.)The Pfizer vaccine has been available to people 16 years and older for almost a year, and “its benefits have been shown to clearly outweigh potential risks,” said Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a statement.When CDC director Rochelle Walensky updated the booster recommendations in November, she cited concern about the Omicron variant to explain the decision.""All adults are now eligible for COVID-19 booster shots,"" said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra in a statement. ""This is especially important ahead of the winter months, where we all spend more time indoors.""The FDA's recent decisions aim to eliminate confusion about who can receive a booster.""I think it's a good idea, just make it easy for people to get a booster, this simplifies things,"" said George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco. ""The concern is people who need a booster not getting one, because of confusion over their eligibility.""Following the advice of its own advisory panels, the FDA had announced in October that eligible individuals could mix and match vaccines for their booster dose. People who are 16 or 17 years old, however, are only eligible for a Pfizer vaccine for their original shots and for their booster.“Is there going to be a wave this winter? There will undoubtedly be a wave this winter among people who are unvaccinated,” Rutherford said. “But at least taking care of this problem of waning immunity will blunt the number of cases among people who have been fully vaccinated. So I think that’s good. There will be less morbidity and mortality because of that.” Advertisement     However, if you are unvaccinated, “you are hanging out in the wind,” Rutherford said. “Again, my only advice is to get vaccinated.” (Check out this vaccine tracker to see how many people have been vaccinated.)Here’s what you need to know about what booster shots are, when you should get them, who is eligible, whether you can mix and match vaccines, and the side effects you might experience.Boosters work.In general, if you have a healthy immune system, COVID vaccines can be more than 90% effective when it comes to preventing symptomatic COVID, hospitalizations, and death. (The one-shot J&J vaccine has typically been slightly less effective than the two-shot Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.)But protection can wane over time. A July 2021 study in Nature Medicine estimated that COVID vaccines with a 90% efficacy dropped to 70% in about seven months and 50% at about nine months. The drop in protection is caused by antibody levels decreasing over time, but also because of the highly contagious Delta variant, now the dominant strain in the US. But many scientists have argued that the vaccines are still highly protective for people who are not at high risk.In September, the FDA granted Pfizer permission to offer boosters for those at higher risk based on evidence that protection started to wane at four months. A study of the Pfizer vaccine found that protection against all variants and the Delta variant was 97% and 93%, respectively, one month after vaccination, but it declined to 67% and 53% four months later. Moderna also published research suggesting that protection wanes over time. People who got the Moderna vaccine during the previous eight months had 36% fewer infections than people vaccinated a year ago.A booster shot can help. FDA data suggests that getting one can reestablish strong protection against the virus. Pfizer, for example, claimed that a booster dose restored the vaccine to about 95% efficacy within a week, which is consistent with observations from Israel.“The available data suggest waning immunity in some populations who are fully vaccinated,” acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in an announcement on Oct. 20. “The availability of these authorized boosters is important for continued protection against COVID-19 disease.” Advertisement     The FDA and CDC have approved boosters for people 16 and older.The FDA has authorized booster doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines for anyone 18 and older who finished their initial two-dose vaccination series at least six months ago, or received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine at least two months ago.People who are 16 or 17 who completed their vaccination at least six months ago are also eligible for a booster shot, but can only receive it with the Pfizer vaccine.You should get a booster if you are 65 or older.In general, whether you’ve had the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or J&J vaccine, you should get a booster if you are 65 or older. This is regardless of your job, living circumstances, or underlying health conditions.The risk of getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19 goes up as you age, starting in your 50s and increasing in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. People who are 85 or older are at particularly high risk.You should get a booster if you have a health condition that puts you at high risk.If you are an adult who’s younger than 65 but you have an underlying health condition, you should get a booster — particularly if you are 50 or older.That includes people who are pregnant, obese or overweight, or immunocompromised and those who have a health condition such as:CancerChronic kidney, liver, or lung diseases (such as moderate or severe asthma)DementiaDiabetesDown syndromeGenetic conditions, such as sickle cell disease or thalassemiaHeart diseasesHigh blood pressureHIVMental health conditions such as depression or schizophreniaStrokeTuberculosisPeople who smoke, people who used to smoke, and those with substance use disorders, like alcoholism or opioid use disorder, should also get a booster. (The CDC notes that this list isn’t the final word; there are other conditions that put you at risk, so talk with your doctor about your own personal risk.)The risk is higher for people with health conditions who are 50 or older, so they are strongly encouraged to get boosters.If you are at risk due to your job.Other people who might most need a booster are those who work in occupations that put them at risk for COVID-19.That includes:Healthcare workersFirefightersPoliceEducators, such as teachers, daycare workers, and support staffUS postal workersPublic transit workersFood and agriculture workersThose who work in grocery stores, corrections, or manufacturingIf you are at risk due to where you live.People who live in high-risk congregate settings like homeless shelters, prisons, jails, and healthcare or mental health institutions are at higher risk of COVID and might more heavily consider getting a booster.If you are pregnant, you can get a booster.People who are pregnant, recently gave birth, or who are thinking about getting pregnant should get vaccinated. They are also eligible for booster shots.As of the end of Oct. 11, more than 22,000 people who were pregnant have been hospitalized and 180 have died due to COVID, according to the CDC. People who are pregnant and have symptomatic COVID are twice as likely to be hospitalized and have a 70% higher risk of dying than people who are not pregnant, the federal agency said.“COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future,” according to the CDC.The partners of people who are trying to get pregnant should also get a vaccine.All adults who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine can get a booster.The FDA advisory panel has unanimously recommended that anyone who is 18 or older and received a J&J vaccine get a booster two months after they received their dose.The J&J vaccine has advantages in that it’s one shot instead of two. But although it’s highly effective at protecting against COVID, it hasn’t been quite as effective as the other vaccines available in the US.For example, CDC data suggests that when it came to preventing COVID hospitalizations, Moderna was 93% effective, Pfizer was 88% effective, and the J&J vaccine was 71% effective.Some FDA advisers even suggested that the J&J vaccine should have been a two-shot vaccine from the start.“I think this frankly was always a two-dose vaccine,"" said FDA vaccine advisory panel member Paul Offit of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. ""It’s hard to recommend this as a one-dose vaccine.”“It’s always been treated like the poor cousin of the mRNA vaccines and I think that’s unfair,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, codirector of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. “I think the benefits of the mRNA vaccine are probably a bit inflated and the disadvantages of the J&J vaccine have been a bit inflated.”Adults can mix and match boosters.If you got a J&J vaccine, can you get a Pfizer or Moderna booster?Yes, if you are 18 or older. Research suggests that might be a good approach: A National Institutes of Health study presented in October to the FDA advisory committee found that a Moderna booster given to people who had previously received a J&J shot produced the most antibodies against the coronavirus. A Pfizer booster given to people who had received a J&J shot produced slightly fewer antibodies. A J&J booster produced the least antibodies.That surprised the FDA’s advisers, who noted that standard practice is to boost a vaccine with its original shot to amplify the immune reaction it first triggered.However, Hotez noted that the study ended at 30 days, which “tends to stack the deck against seeing the benefits of the J&J vaccine,” he said.The J&J vaccine “gives you kind of a delayed kinetics so the antibody titers rise later,” Hotez said. More research may show J&J is more effective than seen in the study.The FDA’s authorization in October also allowed eligible individuals who received Pfizer’s or Moderna’s vaccines to mix and match booster shots. People who received two doses of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine can get any of the three authorized vaccines as their booster dose.There’s no real guidance on what booster shot you should get. The best combination of vaccines is still unclear, and the federal agency’s recommendations reflect that.“We wanted to provide a lot of flexibility because some people don't know what vaccine they got in certain circumstances,” Woodcock said at a press conference in October. “There are people who don't know, there are people who do not want to get the same vaccine they got before because they had some sort of reaction.”Any one of these combinations is reasonable, Marks said.It’s very important that anyone who is in an eligible group get a booster, Woodcock said. “We would expect that many folks will continue with the same regimen that they started with.”When you go to get a booster, you may be asked some questions to determine your eligibility, but you won’t necessarily need to provide medical verification. “They’re taking people at their word that they fall into one of the categories,” Marks said.When you should get a booster depends on the type of vaccine you received.If you are eligible to get a booster, you can get it at least six months after a Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. As mentioned, the CDC advisory panel recommended that adults 49 and younger ""may"" get a booster, not that they ""should,"" in this group.Anyone who received a J&J vaccine should wait at least two months before getting a booster.Boosters are a bit different from the “regular” vaccine.A booster isn’t necessarily just one more dose of a “regular” vaccine. It may be the same dose or it may be lower.If you received a Pfizer vaccine, you got two 30-microgram doses at least 21 days apart. The booster is also 30 micrograms.If you received the Moderna vaccine, you got two 100-microgram doses at least 28 days apart. The booster is a 50-microgram dose, or a half dose of one of your original vaccine shots. Moderna found that that dosage is sufficient, triggering a fourfold rise in the protective response against the Delta variant, according to one study.Moderna is also looking at future shots designed more directly against the Delta variant since it now composes 99% of US cases and looks likely to be the basis for future variants.The J&J booster is the same as the first dose, and it’s given at least two months after the shot.Some people need a third shot, not a booster.What’s the difference, you ask? A third shot is just that — the exact same dose as the first one or two, often given sooner than a booster — and it’s given to people who don’t have a robust enough response the first time around.Since August, the CDC has strongly encouraged people who have moderate to severe immune system problems to get a third shot.That includes people who have had an organ transplant, are currently getting cancer treatment, have HIV, or have to take immune-suppressing medication for autoimmune disorders and other conditions.Of people hospitalized for COVID in June and July, 86% were unvaccinated and 14% were vaccinated, according to CDC data. People with weaker immune systems make up 40% to 44% of the fully vaccinated people who need to be hospitalized.The death of Colin Powell, the first Black secretary of state for the United States, highlights the COVID risk for people with compromised immune systems. Powell, 84, was fully vaccinated but also had multiple myeloma, a type of cancer that can severely affect the immune system. In addition, the treatments for multiple myeloma, and other types of cancer, can reduce the efficacy of vaccines.If you have a weakened immune system, your third shot should be at least 28 days after the second dose of a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. (In other words, you don’t have to wait six months as you do for a booster.)There is not enough data at this time to know whether a second dose of a J&J shot protects immunocompromised people in the same way a third dose of a Pfizer or Moderna shot does, according to the CDC.Booster side effects are similar to getting a second vaccine shot.You may have experienced side effects after being vaccinated, particularly after getting the second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Symptoms like a headache, fever, or nausea can be a sign your immune system is reacting to the vaccine and churning out the protective antibodies you need.When it comes to the booster shot, studies have indicated you might have symptoms similar to what you experienced with the second dose of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.According to the FDA, most side effects were mild or moderate and included headache, fatigue, and muscle aches.More people said they had swollen glands and tenderness in the armpits after the booster than after the first vaccine.“Same as your second dose — sore arm and feeling flu-ish, but that’s about it,” Rutherford said. “You might want to take the next day off.”In presentations to the FDA’s vaccine advisers, Johnson & Johnson reported side effects that were mild and similar to or lower than those seen after the first shot. However, the data was very limited — measured in fewer than 40 people — and the FDA has not had time to double-check the company’s data, something that the agency said it would follow up on.The most common side effects reported after a Johnson & Johnson booster shot were headaches and tiredness.It takes a couple of weeks for booster protection to kick in.Your body needs a little time to make the antibodies you need to fight off COVID. So a booster isn’t instant protection.The first round of vaccines can take a couple of weeks to kick in, and a booster shot is the same.However, longer-lived “memory” immune cells are still in your body from the initial vaccination. For the vast majority of people, these can help protect against getting very sick or being hospitalized before a booster starts to help.In most people, immunity to the virus that causes COVID will start to rise in the weeks after you’ve had a booster shot. The Pfizer and Moderna booster shot effects reached their most effective point after 15 days, while the Johnson & Johnson booster increased steadily for at least 29 days afterward, and possibly longer.COVID boosters are free.Yes, they say nothing in life is free. But boosters for COVID vaccines are, indeed, at no cost. And they are widely available.“These boosters are free,” President Joe Biden said at a press briefing in October. “I’ll say it again: They’re free, available, and convenient to get.”You are still considered fully vaccinated even if you don’t get a booster.If it’s been two weeks since your second shot of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or two weeks after your single shot of the J&J vaccine, you are considered fully vaccinated.After that, even if you don’t get a booster, you are still fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.And finally, if you haven’t been vaccinated at all, get the shot — even if you have had COVID already.The pandemic is still ongoing, so it’s a good idea to get vaccinated if you haven’t already.“I think we’re in the eye of the hurricane again,” Hotez said. “We’ve seen the exact same pattern last year where it started going down around this time, and then as we moved towards the Thanksgiving holidays, then it started going back up.”If you have recovered from a COVID infection, you have some immunity to the virus.However, it may not be as much protection as the vaccine provides: A study in Kentucky suggested that unvaccinated people who weathered a past COVID-19 infection were 2.34 times more likely to get infected again than vaccinated ones, although research is ongoing.“I think there are still too many unvaccinated people, so the recommendation is to go ahead and get vaccinated,” Hotez said.All of the vaccines are good choices, he said. “I think they are all pretty equivalent in terms of safety profile and efficacy.”This is a developing story.

382,Mursion tells big corporate clients that its VR simulations will help teach racial sensitivity. But the actors playing its Black characters are often white.,"


A tech company that provides human resources training to some of the world’s largest corporations has been using white actors to portray people of color in virtual reality simulations about diversity, equity, and inclusion.The simulations, created by corporate education company Mursion, are hypothetical scenarios between a participant and animated humanoid avatars. The avatars are played live by human actors, who follow detailed scenario plans and sometimes improvise. Mursion’s actors, called “simulation specialists,” work alone, playing all the roles in each simulation by using a voice modulator and remote controller to switch between characters. As a result, they often play characters of a race and gender different from their own. Advertisement  In simulations viewed by and described to BuzzFeed News, Black avatars called out other characters’ acts of discrimination, asked participants to rally their companies to support Black Lives Matter, and practiced “supporting a traumatized employee through incidents of racial injustice.” One involved a scenario in which Child Protective Services removed a child from a Black family. In each case, white actors played the roles of the Black characters. In other Mursion simulations, white actors played characters of Asian descent, and neurotypical adults played autistic children.
 


Mursion, which does employ some actors of color, told BuzzFeed News that such “open casting"" is necessary to scale its business and to protect employees of color from having to just endlessly replay ""the same cultural biases, microaggressions, and outright discrimination in our society that too many Americans suffer today."" It defended the practice by saying that its avatars are merely “hypothetical characters"" that are not meant to stand in for “the entirety” of any culture, race, sexual orientation, or gender identity.But scholars of race, theater, and digital media told BuzzFeed News that white actors playing characters of color in DEI simulations like Mursion’s could bring their own unconscious bias into scenarios intended to mitigate bias. Moreover, seven current and former Mursion employees, speaking confidentially with BuzzFeed News, expressed concerns about the company’s own diversity and inclusion practices.One employee described the use of white actors in Black roles as “a really tough thing for a lot of us to stomach.” Two raised concerns about white actors mimicking Black dialect while acting as Black characters. Three independently described an incident in which a white simulation specialist used the n-word while acting as an avatar of color. That actor now trains other simulation specialists. Employees also raised concerns about the visual creation of Mursion’s avatars, citing lack of variation in the skin tone, hair, and facial features of their characters of color, and about the company’s failure to promote and support women employees of color.
 


Mursion CEO Mark Atkinson told BuzzFeed News that the company is working hard to improve its diversity and inclusion practices, and detailed multiple steps it has taken to address the lack of avatar diversity and support for employees of color. ""We recognize that, as humans, we make mistakes,” he said about incidents of stereotyping. He denied any knowledge of an incident in which a simulation specialist used the racial slur. The specialist did not respond to a request for comment.Mursion is one of many corporate training companies that quickly expanded its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) offerings after the murder of George Floyd. But attempts to rapidly scale up DEI training programs have led to wide variability in their quality and depth, said Y-Vonne Hutchinson, CEO of diversity and inclusion consultancy ReadySet. “We have seen some positive indications” that virtual reality could be useful for DEI learning, Hutchinson said. But “when providers don’t have a deep area of expertise or lived experience,” she said, “problematic dynamics” can arise.
 


Some say those dynamics are more than just problematic. To University of Michigan professor Apryl Williams, an affiliate researcher at NYU’s Center for Critical Race and Digital Studies, Mursion’s practice of using white actors to voice characters of color is “just blackface,” analogous to the historically popular, but now widely condemned, use of white actors in makeup to caricature Black people in minstrel shows. Hutchinson agreed: “You can’t separate this from the history of blackface, yellowface, and redface in this country, even if you have the most sensitive actors in the world playing these characters.”Mursion is well aware of such criticism, but the company says the practice is a key to its mission. “It’s necessary for our business that one person plays all the characters in a simulation — otherwise it doesn’t scale,” CEO Mark Atkinson said.This raises key questions about the ethics of representation in virtual reality. Last month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced “the metaverse” as “the successor to the mobile internet.” He envisioned a world where users have multiple avatars: “a photorealistic avatar for work, a stylized one for hanging out, and maybe even a fantasy one for gaming.” But what standards should govern how people buy and sell virtual bodies to inhabit in a world where we can be anyone we want?
 


Mursion was not created to provide diversity and inclusion training. It began as a K–12 teacher training tool, enabling teachers to practice lesson plans on avatar children before going into a live classroom. In 2015, Mursion first began expanding into corporate education, offering companies an opportunity to “improve their employees’ interpersonal skills with customers.” In early 2019, it began advertising simulations about diversity and inclusion, according to an archive of its website.But Mursion’s diversity business expanded after the groundswell of support for racial justice initiatives that followed the murder of George Floyd. As corporations pledged billions in donations to racial equity causes, and the Nasdaq began requiring companies to publicly disclose diversity metrics, Mursion was quick to capitalize on the trend. In November 2020, it closed a $20 million Series B fundraising round with a press release stating that “many recent collaborations are centered on the implementation of immersive Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) training.” Weeks later, the company won 20 medals in the annual Brandon Hall Group Technology Excellence Awards, including the organization’s top prize for “diversity and inclusion innovation.”
 


By late 2020, Mursion was providing simulations about sales, customer service, and other interpersonal skills for some of the most famous brands in the world — Coca-Cola, Starbucks, LinkedIn, and Johnson & Johnson. Meanwhile, it had expanded its offerings to include training for teachers of neurodivergent pupils, such as those with autism. The company enlisted neurotypical actors to play neurodivergent children in simulations with scenario plans, but no scripts.Three employees who spoke with BuzzFeed News said a set of simulations for teachers that involved acting as an autistic child made them uncomfortable. Documents shared with BuzzFeed News include instructions for actors to imitate self-stimulating actions like “rocking” and “hand flapping” to portray the character. One employee who underwent initial training to perform the scenarios declined to finish because they felt they lacked a sufficient understanding of autism to authentically portray the character. Mursion developed these scenarios with help from an advisory group led by Stanford professor Lynn Koegel, who told BuzzFeed News that avatar characteristics were based in part on standard psychiatric criteria and included input from autism experts and neurodiverse people.But other scholars in the field question whether that’s enough. Catherine Lord, professor of psychiatry at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and a practicing clinical psychologist focused on autism, told BuzzFeed News that having non-autistic people play autistic people, when there are autistic actors available, was “unfortunate both in terms of respect for autism but also to the education of the audience.” Dr. Marilyn Augustyn, director of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Boston Medical Center, agreed: “It’s like having a white person play a Black person.”
 


To address questions from BuzzFeed News, Mursion arranged a roundtable discussion with several of its simulation specialists, some of whom were people of color. Atkinson put the question to his employees outright: “Why is it OK for a white actor to play a Black avatar?” Their answers touched on both of the company’s main arguments: that consistently role-playing as Black avatars in scenarios about discrimination could be traumatic for actors of color, and that avatars are not meant to comprehensively represent any one race or ethnicity. One former specialist, a man of color, said “the work is not about playing a Black avatar, or getting into character,” it’s instead about helping learners navigate tense situations in real life.
 


Mursion says its actors can opt out of any simulation that makes them uncomfortable. But most are not salaried employees; they are “variable part-time” workers, paid hourly, so declining to perform certain roles could mean less income. Nonetheless, multiple employees described Mursion’s actors as the leaders of an internal push to improve the company’s DEI practices, in which they have raised concerns about participating in “digital blackface” and requested comprehensive, companywide diversity training.Atkinson, in an email to BuzzFeed News, portrayed the company’s actors as supportive of its casting practices. He wrote that Mursion’s white actors “have agreed to step up” and act in scenarios about diversity, equity, and inclusion. “I am proud of them for taking on this risk,” he added. “I am proud of our non-binary and BIPOC colleagues for urging their white colleagues to do so.”Employees who spoke confidentially with BuzzFeed News took issue with Atkinson’s statements. “That’s some magic — it’s beautifully written, and it’s beautifully bullshit,” said one. Another called the nonbinary and BIPOC colleagues referenced “a figment of Mursion’s imagination.” A third referred to the explanation as “white-savioring.”
 


Debates about racial equity and caricature in casting have shaped the last century of American theater, from the NAACP’s 1954 condemnation of blackface in the long-running radio and television show Amos ‘n’ Andy as a “gross caricature of the Negro,” to the Actors’ Equity Association’s 1990 decision to boycott, and then not boycott, the use of yellowface in a production of Miss Saigon. And while new forms of digital media — video games, for example — have stretched our understanding of what it means to depict a digital character, experts were quick to distinguish the debate around representation in theatrical acting from Mursion’s corporate education product.“This isn’t art,” said Hutchinson, who used to be an actor. “This is commerce. This is business. And that means the people who are telling these stories are making money off of these stories.”Multiple professors of theater told BuzzFeed News that Mursion’s argument about scale — that cross-racial casting is necessary to facilitate its business model — is often used as an excuse in theater to not cast people of color. Those academics, along with several DEI experts, told BuzzFeed News that if Mursion was having difficulty casting Black actors to play Black avatars, it could at least cast actors who are members of some racial or ethnic minority.

This is already being done — just not by Mursion. Jason Chen, a psychologist and DEI specialist at the William & Mary School of Education, has used Mursion simulations in this way since 2017, working with his own team of scenario designers and actors, who are all people of color and experts in diversity and inclusion. His scenarios teach geoscientists to speak up for more diversity in their departments.Chen believes his research shows that such simulations — when combined with attendance at in-person diversity workshops and reading discussion groups — can make scientists more comfortable advocating for diversity, at least in the months directly following the training. But that raises a more basic question about Mursion’s off-the-shelf offerings: Do they actually work?The company provided research to show that math teachers who practice their lessons with Mursion get better results in the classroom than teachers who do not. But it did not provide similar supporting research for its diversity, equity, and inclusion training. Mursion told BuzzFeed News it would take years to build out such a research program, but that it is “slowly developing an ecosystem of research partners ... to replicate these findings.” It also pointed to “proprietary client studies,” which it declined to share.
 


In an email, Mursion CEO Mark Atkinson said, “I have the utmost respect for our clients who understand and appreciate” the company’s casting choices. But it is not clear how much thought Mursion’s clients have given those choices — or whether they are even aware of them. Atkinson said the company tells customers that single actors play multiple characters. Asked if the company makes it explicit that sometimes the Black avatars in their simulations are being voiced by white actors, he replied, “Do we say those literal words? No. But we are fully transparent.""BuzzFeed News reached out to more than a dozen of Mursion’s corporate clients about their use of Mursion simulations and asked specifically whether they knew actors were portraying characters of races different than their own. Some companies, including Coca-Cola, LinkedIn, and McKinsey, declined to comment, and others, including Johnson & Johnson, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and Starbucks, did not answer our inquiries. A 2021 civil rights assessment for Starbucks, prepared by the law firm Covington & Burling, recommended expanding an initial partnership with Mursion as part of the company’s DEI program. But Starbucks Workers United, a group of Buffalo-area Starbucks employees seeking to unionize, told BuzzFeed News that they “do not condone digital or other forms of blackface.”
 


Other Mursion clients, including Google and Nationwide, a large insurance company, acknowledged partnering with Mursion, but said they did not use its simulations for diversity and inclusion education. Mursion’s website says that T-Mobile ran a simulation focused on “supporting a traumatized employee through incidents of racial injustice.” Mursion simulation specialists described this scenario, which involved an employee experiencing an incident of racial profiling, to BuzzFeed News. But a T-Mobile spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that though the company works with Mursion, Mursion “hasn’t supported” its DEI program.Only one company, Indeed, commented on Mursion’s cross-racial casting practices. A spokesperson wrote that the company was “not aware and this is concerning to us. If true, this does not align with our company values and we would discontinue the vendor relationship.”Minda Harts, author of Right Within: How to Heal From Racial Trauma in the Workplace and the keynote speaker for Mursion’s Actionable Empathy Symposium earlier this month, was also unaware of the company’s casting practices until contacted by BuzzFeed News. In her symposium address, Harts said, “Two things can be true at the same time. Someone may not intend harm, not intend racism — but they may nevertheless cause harm, and cause it through racism.”Asked about Mursion’s casting practices, Harts replied: “Sometimes, DEI practices and solutions have every intention of helping their workplace be a more inclusive environment, but the impact might do more harm than good.” She continued, “I want more companies and organizations to be aware of that, and when they do make a misstep, be courageous enough to own it and commit to better equitable practices.” ●

383,"“I didn’t want to write that essay,” Emily told BuzzFeed News. “I realized that I was kind of agonizing over it because I knew that it was going to be made into this thing that I didn’t want to be known for.”","Emily Ratajkowski has opened up about the complicated process of speaking out about sexual assault in her new book of essays, My Body. Speaking to BuzzFeed News during a live event in London on Nov. 30, Emily addressed the conflicting emotions she had about going public with her experiences — particularly the accusations she made against Robin Thicke. In early October — prior to the official release of her book last month — an excerpt from an essay in which she alleged that she was groped by the singer was leaked against her will. Within the excerpt, which was taken from a much longer essay titled “Blurred Lines,” Emily writes about the complications of power and consent in the modeling industry and recalls a specific experience on the set of the music video for Thicke’s hit song that the essay is named after. As you may know, Emily was launched to fame after she starred in the hugely popular 2013 music video for “Blurred Lines,” performed by Thicke, Pharrell Williams, and T.I. “Blurred Lines” wound up being one of the most popular, and polarizing, hits of 2013, and ultimately held the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 for a total of 12 weeks after its debut. The track — which has been widely criticized for its problematic lyrics that seemingly perpetuate rape culture — has two accompanying music videos: one censored, and another uncensored version in which Emily and two other models appear topless. Emily has since publicly distanced herself from the controversial videos, and in 2015 she called her involvement in the project “the bane of [her] existence.” Writing about her experience on the set of the uncensored version of the video, Emily said: “Suddenly, out of nowhere, I felt the coolness and foreignness of a stranger’s hands cupping my bare breasts from behind. I instinctively moved away, looking back at Robin Thicke.” “He smiled a goofy grin and stumbled backward, his eyes concealed behind his sunglasses,” she goes on. “My head turned to the darkness beyond the set. [Director Diane Martel’s] voice cracked as she yelled out to me, ‘Are you okay?’” Two days after the passage was leaked, Emily spoke of her frustration, explaining that her accusations had been misinterpreted without the context of the larger essay from which they were lifted. “It’s been hard for me, I really like to have control over my image and I wrote this book of essays to share the whole story and all sides of it,” she said at a red carpet event in early October. “I feel like it turns into a clickbait frenzy and all of a sudden words like ‘sexual assault’ and ‘allegations’ are getting thrown around rather than people reading the actual essay.” Speaking to BuzzFeed News during a live conversation about her book on Tuesday, Emily addressed the public response to her accusations once again and revealed that she had initially been hesitant to share her experience over fears of being misunderstood. “So I didn’t want to write that essay,” she began, before explaining that it had been her editor who encouraged her to delve deeper into the experience. “I had that anecdote about what happened on the set in another essay,” the author explained. “And my editor said to me: ‘This speaks to so much of what you’re talking about in the other chapters; why have you never talked about this moment that happened on set? Why don’t you write about it more?’” Emily went on to detail the “agonizing” process of putting her experiences into words and expressed her concerns that she would be accused of “capitalizing” off of the controversial “Blurred Lines” video that she had tried to distance herself from. “I went through several drafts and I realized that I was agonizing over it because I knew that it was going to be made into this thing that I didn’t want to be known for,” she said, seemingly referencing her hopes of detaching herself from the 2013 music video. “[I knew] that it would be turned into this moment of, you know: ‘Emily Ratajkowski is capitalizing off of her moment of fame,’” she added. She then disclosed that the full essay was originally intended to be published as a stand-alone piece prior to the release of the full book. However, the actor went on to reveal that the “frustrating” responses to the leaked excerpt prompted her to reevaluate this. “I knew that was what was going to happen,” Emily said, speaking of the public reaction to the initial passage. “The essay was meant to be published ahead of the book,” she revealed. “And after the news leaked, there was this push to kind of edit — it’s quite a long essay — and they wanted to edit it down.” “I sort of decided that I didn’t want it to be published at all,” she said, implying that the scale of people’s misinterpretations highlighted the importance of the wider context of the entire book. “Hopefully, maybe one day they’ll read the book and understand that I was trying to say something more,” she concluded. Elsewhere during Tuesday’s live conversation, host Pandora Sykes recounted the various instances of alleged misconduct that are detailed throughout Emily’s book and asked the model whether she found retelling the stories to be “cathartic, traumatizing, or both.” In response, Emily detailed the complicated emotions she encountered when it came to labeling her experiences as “sexual assault” and explained that it initially made her “nervous” to hear them being branded as such. “I didn’t think I was writing about sexual assault when I was writing about these experiences,” she began. “Even initially when the Cut essay came out, I felt very nervous when people started using that language,” Emily explained, referring to her first stand-alone essay, “Buying Myself Back,” in which she claimed to have been sexually assaulted by a photographer named Jonathan Leder during a photo shoot at his home in 2012. “There were so many very specific connotations to that [type of language],” she said. “I think it becomes this idea of, you picture someone cutting themselves open and bleeding, and pointing fingers at people, and I didn’t want that to be what happened.” She went on to clarify, “I just was writing about experiences that I have shame around, and felt genuinely confused about … It was more about trying to understand how these things happened.” The author concluded by expressing that she doesn’t deem the men who allegedly abused her to be “bad guys,” but rather considers them to be “victims of a culture that made them feel insecure.” “What’s interesting is that even comparing that list of different experiences I’ve had, I still don’t think like ‘Oh, those are bad guys,’” Emily explained. “I really sort of feel like all those people were victims of a culture that made them feel insecure, and made them feel like they had to grab power back. And they didn’t respect women’s boundaries and bodies.” Interestingly, these comments come just a few weeks after Emily revealed that she hasn’t heard from Thicke since her accusations were first leaked nearly two months ago. During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live on Nov. 11, host Andy Cohen asked the model if she had spoken to Thicke since she shared her experience from the set of the “Blurred Lines” shoot. After first clarifying that she had had “a great time” on the set of the music video despite her claims, Emily confirmed that she was yet to hear from the singer in the wake of her accusations. In response, Andy asked if she had expected to hear from him, which prompted the author to clarify her reasoning for sharing her experience with the public. “No,” she said about whether she had been anticipating a response from Thicke. “The essay wasn't written as a gotcha moment. It's about me sort of setting the record straight and sharing the whole truth and my experience with the world.”"
384,The House Freedom Caucus is pleading with Senate Republicans to use procedural leverage to delay government funding in a war against Biden’s COVID vaccine mandates.,"


WASHINGTON — A group of ultra-right-wing Republicans in the House is pushing to briefly shut down the federal government at the end of this week over COVID vaccine mandates.The House Freedom Caucus is sending a letter to Senate Republicans on Wednesday “encouraging them to take every step necessary” to delay a measure funding the government after Friday’s deadline until they get a commitment that Congress won’t fund the Biden administration’s vaccine mandates, Rep. Chip Roy said. Advertisement     “As you know, the current government funding mechanism expires on Friday night, thus the Senate Republican conference enjoys important leverage against those mandates,” the House Freedom Caucus wrote in the letter to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell obtained by BuzzFeed News. “We therefore write to request that you use all procedural tools at your disposal to deny timely passage of the CR unless it prohibits funding — in all respects — for the vaccine mandates and enforcement thereof.”The plan would likely be short-lived if it happens: With Democrats in control of the House and Senate, and McConnell saying he’s uninterested in a shutdown, it’s likely that a short-term funding measure will be agreed to soon. But because of procedural rules, it’s possible the group of Republicans will be able to delay the process and trigger a short shutdown if they get enough Senate support. Republican Sen. Mike Lee suggested to Politico on Wednesday that he was on board with the move, saying he “can’t facilitate” a funding resolution “without addressing the vaccine mandates.”It’s so far uncertain how many Republicans back the plan. McConnell told reporters on Tuesday that “nobody should be concerned about a government shutdown.” And the plan does not seem to be a priority of the majority of the Republican caucus — a source in the room for Wednesday morning’s House Republican conference said the funding question didn’t even come up.Roy told BuzzFeed News that the ""entire Freedom Caucus"" supported the funding fight against vaccine mandates.""We've got the Senate with significant numbers of senators that are having this conversation, had a serious conversation about this at their lunch yesterday in the entire Senate Republican Conference,"" Roy said. ""And I think this is an opportunity for both Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy to demonstrate leadership when we need it."" Advertisement     The push against President Joe Biden’s mandates comes as courts continue to delay their implementation. A federal judge on Tuesday at least temporarily blocked a mandate for healthcare workers, which had been scheduled to start next week. And it also comes as uncertainty spirals around the Omicron variant, which could complicate the global effort to fight the coronavirus.Some Republicans have already begun pushing false conspiracy theories about the variant. Rep. Ronny Jackson ⁠— former president Donald Trump’s onetime doctor ⁠— tweeted over the weekend that the variant was somehow a way for Democrats to “cheat” next year’s midterm elections.

385,"Sebold chronicled her experience of being attacked and raped while a college student in her first book, the memoir Lucky. Last week, the man convicted was exonerated.","


Alice Sebold, the author of The Lovely Bones, apologized Tuesday to the man who spent 16 years behind bars after he was wrongfully convicted of raping her when she was a college student.In a statement released first to the Associated Press and then published on Medium, Sebold said she was ""truly sorry"" to Anthony Broadwater Jr. and that she deeply regretted what he had been through.""I am sorry most of all for the fact that the life you could have led was unjustly robbed from you, and I know that no apology can change what happened to you and never will,"" she wrote. Advertisement     Last week, a New York state judge overturned Broadwater's conviction on first-degree rape and other charges connected to Sebold's 1981 assault, which she wrote about in her 1999 memoir Lucky.His defense attorneys argued he had been convicted on insufficient and now-discredited forms of evidence — something that even the Onondaga County district attorney agreed with.“I’m not going to sully these proceedings by saying, ‘I’m sorry,’” District Attorney William Fitzpatrick told the court. “That doesn’t cut it. This should never have happened.”Broadwater had always maintained his innocence and was repeatedly denied parole while imprisoned because he refused to admit to the crime.“I’ve been crying tears of joy and relief the last couple of days,” Broadwater told the Associated Press after he was formally exonerated and removed from the sex offender registry. “I’m so elated, the cold can’t even keep me cold.”
 


When Sebold was an 18-year-old first-year student at Syracuse University, she was attacked while walking through a tunnel.Months later, she passed a man walking on the street and called police to report she believed he was her attacker.""He was smiling as he approached. He recognized me. It was a stroll in the park to him; he had met an acquaintance on the street,"" she wrote in Lucky. ""‘Hey, girl,’ he said. ‘Don’t I know you from somewhere?’""""I looked directly at him. Knew his face had been the face over me in the tunnel.”Broadwater was later arrested when a police officer suggested he had been seen in the area where Sebold said she had seen the man.But Sebold failed to pick Broadwater out of a police lineup and instead selected another Black man.In court, though, she testified it was Broadwater who had raped her — in part, his defense attorneys later claimed, because prosecutors falsely told her that the man she had picked out of the lineup was a friend of Broadwater and that the pair were trying to trick her. Advertisement     Fitzpatrick, the district attorney, noted in court last week that witness identifications of strangers can often be unreliable, especially when made across racial lines.He also blasted the now-discredited ""junk science"" of microscopic hair analysis that was used to convict Broadwater.In her apology on Tuesday, Sebold blamed the wrongful conviction on a ""flawed legal system"" in which she had put her faith as a ""traumatized 18-year-old rape victim.""""It has taken me these past eight days to comprehend how this could have happened,"" she wrote. ""I will continue to struggle with the role that I unwittingly played within a system that sent an innocent man to jail. I will also grapple with the fact that my rapist will, in all likelihood, never be known, may have gone on to rape other women, and certainly will never serve the time in prison that Mr. Broadwater did.""Broadwater's exoneration may not have come about were it not for a planned film adaptation of Lucky, which detailed the assault and the post-traumatic stress disorder Sebold developed in its aftermath.Timothy Mucciante had signed on to serve as executive producer, but abandoned the project when he noticed discrepancies between the script and memoir.“I started having some doubts, not about the story that Alice told about her assault, which was tragic, but the second part of her book about the trial, which didn’t hang together,"" Mucciante told the New York Times.Mucciante hired a private investigator to reexamine the case, who then brought Broadwater's plight to the attention of a defense attorney.Variety reported Tuesday that the film adaptation, which had been set to star You actor Victoria Pedretti, had been scrapped.Broadwater told the New York Times that even though he was released from prison in 1999, his life had been ruined by his wrongful conviction.He said he faced stigma from loved ones and struggled to find employment due to his status as a sex offender.A member of his defense team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sebold's apology.A spokesperson for Simon & Schuster and its imprint Scribner, which published Lucky, said they had consulted with Sebold and will cease distribution of all formats of the memoir while they work with the writer to consider how the book might be revised.

386,"All you need is an owl, a cassoulet, and the constant specter of looming death.","


The month before your 30th birthday has been an unrelenting onslaught of bad news. You try to keep your chin up because you love your birthday — you’re an Aquarius, but also a narcissist above all, so this should be your time. Instead, you feel like you’re pressing your forehead against very cold glass, waiting for it to shatter and cut you up into a million little pieces.You’re into your second year of quarantine thanks to a pandemic that you once dismissed as “just a bad flu.” Every day you take your stupid little depression walk with your stupid little mask, and you think about your stupid little brain and how, for a fleeting moment, it convinced you that this would be nothing. You haven’t seen your family or most of your friends since early 2020; you, a genius, opted to move to New York from Toronto a year before the pandemic hit, and now you feel trapped in a place that looks like home but feels completely foreign. When you google grocery stores (you don’t recognize any of the chains) to try to find bucatini, you just find a bodega that sells nothing but 6-year-old lime chips. Your niece calls you and tells you she’s been watching news clips of you online because she misses seeing your face and hearing your voice. You have never been punched in the nose with a closed fist (surprising, since you’ve often deserved it), but this is probably what it feels like. Advertisement  Every weekend, you sit in a transparent bubble built out of plastic and zippers, encircling a little patio table and chair and heater. Your ankles are on fire, your head is freezing cold. You’re too chilly — in every meaning of the word — to ever really enjoy the pleasure of getting drunk. You bring a Corpse Reviver No. 2 to your lips, shivering, and think, Yes, this is fine.Three weeks before your birthday, your Veena Masi dies in India, a country that once told you that you belonged there and then denied you a visa for entry, right before the pandemic hit. People tell you that the canceled trip was good news — “Imagine being stuck in India for all this!” It’s cold comfort — you’re sure you were denied because of an article you wrote a year earlier, critical of the Indian government and its handling of Kashmir, but you can’t even get any confirmation of this. Your aunt was a small, spry woman who spoke very little English but always held your hands in hers and told you that you look like your mother. She was a year younger than your mom, who calls you from Canada wailing into the phone. Her family is shrinking. She didn’t see this one coming. You want to run to her and make her chai and help manage your father, but you can’t, because there’s a pandemic, and accidentally killing your mother seems worse than just letting her suffer in front of you on FaceTime. “My childhood is gone,” she says. You’re quiet, and you listen, distinctly aware that your mother’s unbearable grief is but a reminder that your childhood, too, is slipping away.Your niece’s dog, Steven “Steve” Roger Koul, a miniature dachshund your brother got when you were in the 11th grade, is starting to slow down. He isn’t eating, he seems disoriented, and his face is mostly gray. Most of his teeth have been pulled, so now he peers around the room with his tongue hanging out of his mouth. It’s cute, but still a harbinger of doom. He’s an old man, but you’re hoping he can get through the year. You think about how you once took care of him for three weeks, and he kept leaping up on the kitchen counter to eat your lunches, day after day. You cry, because now he can’t really eat any sandwiches at all. Advertisement  Despite opening your laptop every day for 10 to 13 hours, you have made less than no progress on your book. You sold it a year before the pandemic compressed your life, a collection of essays about...what was it again? Fighting? Fights? Being an asshole? All three, maybe. But you have lost any sense of who you are, and such a thing makes writing about yourself impossible. When you read the thoughts of your own narrator, you think to yourself, God, I hate this woman. You wonder if you should give the money back to your publisher, or perhaps try to say something so inflammatory that they just cancel it themselves. (Written in your notebook during a brainstorm: “Do a murder? Be racist against an invented ethnic group? Try to get on Red Scare?”)You get a haircut because you want to feel better. It comes out looking like Steve chewed on your hair and left you with jagged ends. You call your friend Barb, who looks at you with her saddest eyes because she knows it’s beyond repair — that’s how you really know things are falling apart. You cry for three days while your husband, typically bold and confident, stands awkwardly at your bedroom door, looking at you, stricken. “But I like bangs,” he says, mostly to himself.
 


Steve has to be put down two weeks after Veena Masi’s death. Your niece is handling it better than any of the adults; she calls wearing a tiger onesie and plies you with platitudes. “He was old, Boo,” she says. “It was his time.” (She is still little enough to call you Boo — will that eventually change too?) She asks if you can still play video games together, a small reassurance that she’s malleable enough to not be forever embittered by this random, cruel moment in her life. Does everything really need to be taken away from this little girl, all at the same time? She’s in remote learning again, like children everywhere, and she hates it. She can’t even hug her grandparents, something she understands, but they somehow do not, despite being 60 years older than her. “Just one hug,” your dad tells her when she visits, outside, masked, many feet apart. “I’ll put a blanket on you and then hug you.”Your niece becomes incensed by your father’s disregard for the rules. “Don’t you get it?” she screams at him, her pink little face becoming red. “I could kill you!”Your mom’s older sister gets COVID, so she calls to talk about that, instead of the knee replacement she desperately needs. She texts you the crying-laughing emoji instead of the crying emoji, which for once, you can’t bring yourself to find very funny. Advertisement  What is a little funny is that turning 30 marks the end of other people thinking you’re exceptional. When you’re young and competent, people treat you like you’re some kind of wunderkind. It’s impressive that you can do your job, that you’re climbing out of debt, that you’re forming healthy relationships. But by the time you’re 30, you’re just doing what’s expected of you. It’s mundane, your semi-tidy apartment, your shelfful of books that visitors expect you to have actually read. That seems unfair. You realize that the next few years will be spent accepting that you’re no longer young enough to be considered interesting or compelling, and not old enough to have institutional power or an advanced sense of self-confidence. No one praises you for owning an iron anymore. Who will care about your average book at your average age?Your bangs continue to grow out, by which you mean horizontally. You look like a My Chemical Romance fan club president. You would like to die, but instead, you have to be grateful to not have the coronavirus, to have most of your family intact, to be healthy, to be alive. It’s a stupid fucking list — what kind of life is it to just have to be thankful for not losing it all the time? You grind your teeth so hard that the back of your front tooth chips. Instead of getting it fixed, you spend days rubbing your tongue against it until it bleeds.You post a photo of your bad haircut on Instagram in an attempt to make fun of yourself, the only way you know how to cope with a mild irritant. You end up hurting your own feelings when a stranger messages you, “I love mullets on brown women!” You delete the photo and write “FUCK” in a journal for seven pages. Advertisement  
 


So wrapped up in your own grief about the pandemic — and the idea of turning 30, which you have decided will remain just an idea, because you are not interested in actually turning 30 — you’re only startled back into being a person when your husband’s uncle and cousin die in quick succession. He spends hours on the phone with a family he can’t touch, all the cousins who look like shades of him. While he coughs through a tear, you angrily gaze at the small Hindu shrine you’ve built on your bookshelf. You’re not religious, but this year has made you desperate so you’ve taken to periodically lighting a candle at the feet of deities while offering various deals: If you don’t kill anyone, you can force me to keep this bad haircut indefinitely. If you make sure no one in my family gets hurt before we can see them again, you can put me in a little bit of debt. Not like Erika Jayne debt, though. Little debt. Cute debt. Debt I can joke about later.When your husband sleeps, you march up to the five of them. “I thought we had a deal? I thought lighting some nag champa and considering not eating meat on Tuesdays was the price??” They say nothing. You wonder if maybe you should join a cult instead. Advertisement  Your husband’s niece comes down with COVID, a result of still having to go to work through this collective year of agony. He frets about her quietly, how far she is from home too, how no one is there to take care of her. She’s in college, she should be out having fun. Like everything, this doesn’t feel fair either.The next week, you get your first American tax bill: an absolute assault of $10,000. You can pay it, but barely, in a way that brings your bank balance so low it makes you nauseous to look at your banking app. That same week, your husband’s niece and your aunt both recover within weeks of their first symptoms. You feel Lakshmi’s eyes on your back, her face cast in porcelain. You ask; I deliver.
 


Since the pandemic has halted largely everything about your life — except, allegedly, the passing of time — the biggest bash you can throw for your birthday is to drive upstate with your husband to a little house you’ve rented for a long weekend. It’s a brick cabin in a gated community, enshrined in ice after a few storms, which makes leaving the house a treacherous journey. The owner is a criminologist and former antiques dealer, giving the home a distinct “someone was murdered here” feel. The living room smells like mothballs and overflows with more rusty telescopes than you ever knew existed. One bookshelf is dedicated entirely to fragments of seashells. The kitchen is chaos; there’s a whole shelf just for gold-rimmed goblets, two AGA stoves that never turn off and rest at a fixed but indeterminate temperature, which makes cooking a bit of a magic trick. On the wall is an 1880s-era phone that doesn’t work, probably because the house doesn’t need you calling for help while the walls bleed and the home’s aura turns you inside out. It is a good place to contemplate your mortality. Advertisement  You tug on the cord leading to the attic and find two twin beds and a pile of furs. There are cabinets and closets with thick, impenetrable locks on them. This should be...fine.But who cares? This trip is for naught, because you’re not really turning 30. To turn 30 would suggest that the year you’ve spent in quarantine counted at all. It would suggest that time has been moving on as normal, which it clearly has not, evidenced by the fact that your body has not left your neighborhood in months. You entered the pandemic at the very beginning of your 29th year, so it’s impossible that you could be leaving it at 30 — or maybe even 31.You were raised in a family that required you to call every evening and use your vacation days to come home and visit. You’ve been calling, sure, but the conversations blend together, and there’s never any news, never any new stories to tell. You’re just happy your parents are alive and faking cheerfulness for your sake. No news, no progress, no time gone. So this isn’t really your 30th. You still have time to make it on a “30 Under 30” list, because this year doesn’t count. Advertisement  The day before your birthday, you rush to your husband excitedly with a plan. “Let’s do drugs tomorrow,” you say, hopping lightly on your toes while he toils away in the kitchen with the impossible stove that’s always on. He’s making cassoulet, the way your favorite restaurant in Toronto makes it. For days already, he’s been slow-cooking duck, simmering ragù, toasting bread crumbs, and braising sausage. “Do you really want to trip on your birthday?” he asks. Who knows. You mostly wanted to finish a book. But this is what young people do, and you are still young, because you are not yet 30.“We can,” your husband says, stirring the beans that have already been cooking for 16 hours. “But I made this big meal, and I want you to be able to enjoy it.” He looks at you worried and wounded that you’re tamping down your generally robust appetite. “You’re right,” you tell him with a quick kiss on the cheek, and let him go back to his beans. You spend some time in the attic excitedly looking for a body. You can only fight who you are for so long.
 


The morning of your birthday, you wake up and your husband presents you with videos from everyone you know and love, wishing you happy birthday from their little corners of the world, all huddled away from one another in case of death. He gets you an upsettingly overpriced hair dryer. You’re 30. It feels fine. When you post a photo of yourself on Instagram announcing your acceptance of this age, you’re feted with compliments about how “you look so much younger!” or “I thought you were older, you’re so accomplished!” Both are satisfying in different ways, and you bask like a pig in shit.Some of your best friends have scheduled a Zoom call for the afternoon. They’re your friends, but the closeness you feel with them even after exactly a year apart makes it feel like there should be a better word for them, one that contextualizes how they kept you alive during the nadir of your persistent depression.You chat with them for hours while draining a bottle of wine. Soon, you get sleepy and try to wind it down — everyone has virtual meeting fatigue, and you don’t want to make it worse for the faces you see in these little floating cubes, people who are similarly stuck in an emotional tundra, waiting for some kind of release. But suddenly, your friends all go on mute and start dropping off from the call, one by one. Then only Seb is left, and he peers at you while chewing on his nails. “I’ll send you a new link,” he says, disappearing himself. Advertisement  When you click on the new link, you’re transported to the University of Minnesota’s official Zoom account. A mistake? A prank, maybe? None of your friends are foolish enough to make such an error, and none of them are cruel enough to throw you into a first-year econ class on your birthday. But now you can make out the university’s Raptor Center. More importantly, you can see an owl called Ricky, who has rickets, who has been hired for your birthday to eat a mouse whole. Ricky gives you a little hoot and murders a mouse with three bites. It is horrific. You have never been so happy in your life. Imagine being so lucky that your friends — these people you met a decade ago, or even longer — know exactly what you want, which is to watch an owl choke down a mouse in your honor.The cassoulet is perfect. You have three servings. You and your husband sleep wrapped up together, like two trees that learned to grow around each other. Maybe it’s love, maybe you’re worried something is going to crawl out of the attic and kill you. Who cares. It’s a good feeling.Months later, when the ice melts, your friend Jenna holds your hand across a table at dinner in Bushwick and weeps about 30 being just around the corner for her. There were so many things she wanted to do before this birthday, so much taken from her in the last year and a half as well. She dabs at her impeccable eyeliner, stopping the bleed from running down her cheeks. “It’ll be OK,” you tell her, squeezing her hand in yours. “It’s just a birthday. How bad could it be?” Advertisement     Your niece gets a new dog, a little puppy she has named Beans. For years, you’ve been calling your niece Bean, and so now they are Bean and Beans, two little rats you love very much. Steve lives on in Beans’ shrieky bark and Bean’s unbridled happiness.You send a few pages of your book to your editor, finally, a year after she first emailed you waiting for a manuscript. “You’re right, they’re disjointed and stream of consciousness,” she tells you. “But there’s something there.” Are you relieved? Maybe — quitting altogether would’ve been nice, too.“I think the problem is you’re still writing like you did before the pandemic. And it’s not working because you’re not that person anymore. And I don’t know if you like the person you’ve become. How are you supposed to write about someone you don’t like?” You pull on the stack of new grey hairs you have sprouting from your temple.“For what it’s worth,” she finishes, “I like who you became. I think she’s great.” It’s been years since you’ve liked yourself, even longer since you’ve been able to verbalize it, but you did once, and maybe you can again. That afternoon, you sit with who you are now, and you get back to work. ● Advertisement

387,"With a new confessional memoir and his growing social media presence, Will Smith is trying to reinvent himself for a new era of celebrity.","


Perhaps you’re like me, and you’re waving the white flag. Perhaps you’re on your knees, hands clasped, eyes set toward the sky, begging: Please, Lord, let me not find out any more unsolicited information about Will Smith’s sex life. In the last few months, and especially in the last few weeks, we’ve learned entirely too much.We’ve learned Will Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, have an open marriage, and sometimes it’s hard. Sure. At some point, he wanted a “harem of girlfriends.” Go off! We’ve learned that sometimes Jada is maybe not 100% satisfied with their sex life. Huh? No, wait, actually she is totally satisfied. Folks! In fact, speaking of satisfaction, there was this one time when Smith was so focused on her pleasure that he was either going to satisfy her or die trying. This week, we learned that Smith dealt with being cheated on by his first girlfriend by having so much sex that it made him gag, and at times vomit, as a “psychosomatic reaction” to an orgasm. Driver, stop this bus, I’m done. Advertisement     But regardless of the mercy you may be begging for, it’s fascinating that we now know this stuff. Not just because of the salacious and utterly bizarre nature of what Smith is revealing about his private life, but because it’s a drastic break in the long-established celebrity relationship we’ve had with Smith. Before we entered this overshare phase, it’s actually hard to think about what we really knew about him. Now, it seems I can’t eject out of the conversation fast enough.At the peak of his power, a formidable reign that spanned from 1996’s Independence Day to 2008’s Seven Pounds, nearly anything Smith touched turned to gold. He turned 2008’s Hancock into a box office smash for Christ’s sake. He was so good at his job that by 2009, he was voted Hollywood’s most bankable star. He was always unruffled, the Platonic ideal of a celebrity: His face adorned magazines and movie posters, smiling confidently, revealing nothing. He hovered above us, and we projected our hopes and dreams onto him.
 


But lately, Smith has been coming down to our level. He’s been sharing his wounds, the things that make him human. He’s been sharing his struggles with marriage, fatherhood, and body image. He’s been making vaguely entertaining TikToks. He’s been messy and memeably upset. He’s been confessional like never before.What’s all this for? The obvious answer is promotion: Smith just released a tell-all memoir titled, simply, Will. Its release coincides with the peak of his press cycle for his latest film, King Richard, where he plays the legendary Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena Williams. His performance in Richard is the best acting he has done in years; it’s impossible to take your eyes off of him as he disappears into the role. He is a heavy contender for the upcoming Oscar race, and it's generally a good strategy to keep the Academy voters’ attention on you.But Smith might have a shrewder plan. A byproduct of ’90s celebrity culture, he is attempting something few men of his generation of stars have done: reinventing himself publicly, to align with the contemporary expectations of celebrity. We once held celebrities at a distance and in high regard. That doesn’t work anymore.Most of the men who became household names at the turn of the century are content to coast on the old ways of being famous. Not Smith — he is trying to meet the moment, and to do so, he’s on an all-out mission to master the language of modern celebrity. Are you not entertained?
 


Will Smith’s career highs are historic. Keep this in mind as you consider that his lows have been not just disappointments but, occasionally, catastrophes. Starting in 2013, Smith has been plagued with a series of career failures. That was the year After Earth was released — a film costarring his son Jaden that led one critic to ask, “Is After Earth the worst movie ever made?”There’s 2016’s Collateral Beauty, which managed to earn a Rotten Tomatoes score only four points higher than After Earth, coming in at a dismal 15%. There’s Focus, a movie you haven’t heard of until you read this sentence. 2017’s Bright, a Netflix film, was widely panned, as was 2019’s Gemini Man.But the most compelling thing about all these failures is that on paper, all of them actually appear like safe bets. Gemini Man, a big-budget thriller, was directed by acclaimed director Ang Lee. Bright had the backing of Netflix, and it came at a moment when its director, David Ayer, had just proven himself with back-to-back successes with End of Watch and Fury. Even After Earth had M. Night Shyamalan at the helm, and should have theoretically worked.
 


It’s easy to pin the bad reviews or poor performance of these films on Smith. But choosing each of these films must’ve seemed logical for the actor: He had just spent 10-plus years testing his own star power and passing the test each time. Why wouldn’t these work? Maybe it had nothing to do with him. Maybe Will Smith never changed at all. Maybe we were the ones who changed.Smith blossomed as a star in the ’90s and early aughts, a stretch of time when the very idea of celebrity was at its most potent. We didn’t know it then, but with relatively few outlets telling us what we should be caring about or consuming, we were in the firm grip of a vast monoculture, perhaps for the last time in pop culture history. Once the Hollywood machine made you a celebrity, there was little you could do to lose the title. Fame was the all-powerful currency. Reality TV was still a quirky and lowbrow offering. You want to watch real people? Instead of the perfect celebrities? What’s wrong with you?Cut to the decade of Smith’s successive letdowns, and reality TV had supplanted pretty much any other form of entertainment. The Kardashians were putting on a master class in sustaining eyeballs with interpersonal drama played out on TV. Audiences craved messiness and had grown suspicious of the all-put-together celebrities of yore. Online, social media transformed the appearance of authenticity into the measure of who deserves attention. Relatability is the minimum price of admission: We’ve all got phones and cameras, and we can take our attention anywhere, so if we can’t see ourselves in you, why would we give you the time of day, anyway?It’s tempting to underestimate the significance of the shift in the forms of celebrity. But consider this: In September, Smith told GQ that when he started posting more frequently online, it was in part inspired by seeing Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart post behind-the-scenes photos from their movies. Smith seems to have found that shocking: “They were doing unheard of stuff, posting pictures from set,” he told GQ. Unheard of stuff: This was counter to everything Smith had learned in celebrity school — be composed and controlled, and never let the public see your drafts.The men of Smith’s generation of superstardom seem particularly interested in maintaining how they perform the duties of celebrity. Matt Damon prefers the route of New York Times profiles and late-night talk shows. George Clooney makes himself scarce, and only grants the odd interview. Brad Pitt might be happy to get headlines from touching Jennifer Aniston’s hand, but it’s hard to imagine him posting anything confessional or unpolished. It’s not that these men can’t do it — it’s that any efforts of relatability on their parts simply do not cohere with how we think about them. They’re frozen in time circa 2002, all larger than life and no hair out of place.What might inspire Smith to try to evolve past this, though? How about his wife, Jada? In 2018, she reinvented herself by launching Red Table Talk, a talk show she hosts with their daughter, Willow, and her own mother, Adrienne Banfield-Norris.Jada, who is now perhaps more famous than she’s ever been, seems to particularly understand the assignment: the whole premise of her show is built around radical frankness and a willingness to be vulnerable in public. She invites famous people to redeem themselves through honesty, and she shares her private life too. The more open she became, the more the public responded. Perhaps Smith was forced to confront the value of this honesty when Jada used her platform to dissect their marital problems, and as she did, she found an audience willing to engage. “I’m bringing myself to the Red Table,” she tweeted. The internet talked about their conversation far more than they’d talked about any of Smith’s movies in years. It seems like this is what people want now.
 


You want confessional? Fine, Smith will give you confessional. “What you have come to understand as ‘Will Smith,’ the alien-annihilating MC, the bigger-than-life movie star, is largely a construction,” Smith writes in his memoir. “A carefully crafted and honed character — designed to protect myself. To hide myself from the world.”The revelation is necessary. We know the jig is up. If Smith is to make the passage from the unreachable mode of celebrity to the relatable realm, he must first admit that the persona was a fiction, and that it served a purpose. There are not many celebrities who make that journey — and even fewer who do so from the level of Smith’s fame.One of them is Jay Z, who might be the closest analog to the kind of transformation of identity that Smith is trying to achieve. Both have long been seen as the consummate professionals: Smith the reliable big hero actor, Jay the rapper’s rapper. Both have always been put-together, private, calculated. And, crucially, both do not seem to be undergoing this transformation comfortably.After Beyoncé implied heavily in her 2016 album Lemonade that Jay cheated on her, the rapper released 4:44, the most confessional album of his career. It’s a compelling record that saw Jay facing his failings — as a husband, a father, a man, and an artist. He questions where he got his ideas of masculinity, and wrestles with undoing them. It’s raw and vulnerable and nothing like what we were used to from Jay. It was also his most critically lauded album in a decade.Both Smith and Jay have presented new, unvarnished sides of themselves as a consequence of the partners’ fame. Neither of them seem to be in their element — Jay begins 4:44 with “Kill Jay Z,” a song that spells out how he’s going to have to get comfortable with ego death, while Will Smith’s TikToks are occasionally kind of cringey or forced. Advertisement     But on the face of it, it’s hard to deny that the oversharing is working. Here is Smith re-creating a TikTok trend (that uses a Jaden song!). There he goes, talking about this one time he played a prank on Jada by showing one of her sex scenes to his grandmother. It’s not the way he came up, and it’s not the way he was used to performing fame. But surely he can see by now that the more he shares, the more of the world’s attention he has.●

388,"The former Disney Channel actor has spent the past few decades unpacking the trauma of being a child star. Now, with a new confessional YouTube channel, she’s cashing in.","


The Christy Carlson Romano who greeted me at the door of her Austin home wasn’t the Disney Channel teen whom millions of millennials grew up watching in the early 2000s. She also wasn’t the YouTuber who has gone viral multiple times over the past several months for oddly compelling walking confessional videos where the 37-year-old, clad in tight athleisure, spills her unfiltered thoughts on heavy topics like child stardom, abusive stage parents, and her history with alcoholism and an eating disorder.The Romano I met looked like an average suburban mom. Wearing a Mickey Mouse sweatshirt and jeans, she let me into her house from a porch filled with Halloween decorations. We walked past the living room, where there was a huge dry-erase calendar filled with the schedules for her two daughters, Isabella and Sophia. A black cat winded its way through my legs as Romano offered me seltzer from her fridge.We were a long way from Hollywood, where Romano found fame starring in Even Stevens and Kim Possible, and from New York City, where she got her start acting on Broadway and once played Belle in Beauty and the Beast. But Romano has never felt so balanced. “I’m happy to be here,” she said of her new hometown. “I’m so grateful to be in a place that I feel like is neutral and I don’t have to think about.”She had been posting on YouTube since 2019, but her new videos have vaulted her from relative obscurity to almost-weekly coverage in the tabloids. In “How Stage Moms Destroy Childhoods,” she talks about seeing her fellow child stars being mistreated and even abused by their parents. In “How I Lost All My Money,” she reveals that she wasted all of the millions of dollars she had made as a child actor and had to start basically from scratch financially as an adult. In “How Psychics Scammed Me Out of $60,000,” she tells the story about how she, well, got scammed out of $60,000 by psychics.Now, though, Romano seems to be thriving. She and her husband, Brendan Rooney, moved to Austin from Orange County, California, in 2020. Here, she feels free from the stress of show business, that all-consuming desperate sense that if she wasn’t hustling for her next big break, she was failing.“If I’m in California, I’m wondering if I’m going to get an audition,” Romano said as we sat on her back deck. “I’m like, OK, I’m here. Do I need to meet with my agent? What do I need to do?”Romano started working as an actor when she was 6 years old and continued throughout most of her childhood, commuting from Connecticut to New York City for auditions throughout elementary and middle school and skipping high school for Even Stevens and Kim Possible.
 


As an adolescent, she yearned to be your basic, average girl but got even more famous instead. Now Romano has a chance to finally live her life on her own terms, making the content she wants to make without having to play by the rules of “the industry,” as she calls it. Romano has found a niche in mining her own notoriety, opening up about her experiences and sharing them with the masses — even the unflattering parts.“It’s a fine line between cashing in and selling out,” she acknowledged.In the process, she’s working through and addressing what growing up in the public eye did to her mental health and raising awareness for what being a child star is really like. “Time is ticking,” she said. “I’ve waited for too long.” YouTube allows her to get to know her audience extremely well, down to what content they really want. “I know so much about my analytics, and I’m learning so much about the community out there. And so it’s cool how connected you can actually be.”Her goal? Stacking cash, to give her girls the thing she desperately craved for years: stability.“This is giving me the freedom to enjoy my life with my girls. If I had to be on a set all day and I was there for 12 hours a day, I would literally lose their childhood,” she said. “I wouldn’t be able to be there for them. The way that I want to be is sort of like this working stay-at-home mom. And so I’m kind of getting the best of both worlds.”
 


One of the first things Romano brought up as we settled into our conversation wasn’t YouTube, or the Disney Channel, or her headline-making revelations. It was dance.Specifically, dance classes for children. Romano is starting to sign up her daughters, ages 2 and 4, for activities, including nursery school and swim class. Inevitably for little girls in suburban America, dance is one of them.It’s a seemingly simple decision, but Romano agonized over it, describing the process as “triggering.” Dance classes were how she eventually became a child star. One minute, it seemed, she was tagging along to her older sisters’ dance competitions, and then, suddenly, she was on Broadway.“I was like, ‘Am I going to do this? Like, is the train leaving the station?’” she told me.In 1998, the New York Daily News wrote a feature highlighting her life as a teen Broadway star. Romano, then 14, had been playing Mary Phagan, a murder victim, in the Lincoln Center musical Parade. The Daily News painted her as a precocious ingenue with a Hannah Montana–esque lifestyle, dazzling audiences nightly before racing back home to suburban Connecticut to attend high school as a first-year student. Advertisement  “I’ve been maintaining a 95 average, too,” the newspaper quoted Romano as saying, “proudly.”According to Romano, this characterization was a facade. In reality, Romano said she never was a normal kid.She told me that her mother had tried to get all of her children into performing, but none of Romano’s three older siblings, who were teenagers when they dabbled in the business, really had much success or enthusiasm for it. Only Romano, driven and eager to please, took to the industry from an early age. At age 6, she was appearing in Annie at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta and soon after booked small roles in television shows and movies (she played a trick-or-treater in Woody Allen’s 1996 movie Everyone Says I Love You).
 


It didn’t hit Romano how young she had really been when she started her career until her own daughters were born. As her oldest, Isabella, has gotten closer to the age at which Romano started seriously pursuing acting, she has realized how little control she had over the decision to become a child star, which had a domino effect on her entire life.“It’s crazy to think of a child’s childhood essentially being completely derailed,” she told me.In one of her videos, Romano said she only believes parents should seek out acting opportunities if it is an “organic” dream of their children. Was she one of those children? She seems unsure. Instead, Romano remembers her biggest motivator being a desire to please the adults around her. She enjoyed performing, but what was most gratifying was attending auditions and getting immediate positive feedback.“The thing that I remember the most is making people smile,” she said.As her career began to take off, Romano attended the Professional Children’s School in Manhattan. A distinct childhood memory is the extensive time she spent on trains with her mother, making the two-hour trip between school and home in Milford, Connecticut. Romano said this left her with a lifelong feeling of being transient, with no place where she truly belonged. In hindsight, she said, that had a real effect on her young psyche.“I wasn’t good with change, but I was pushed into change my whole life,” she said. “And so that’s why I was always craving normalcy.”At school with her fellow child actors, Romano dealt with the all-consuming drive to be famous and compete with her peers. When she returned home to the suburbs, she wanted to fit in with her three siblings, who were living relatively average lives, and, she speculates, had a hard time dealing with the fact they were not enjoying the same level of acting success. She also wanted to form real, lasting friendships back home. So that first year at a public high school was everything for her, including a chance to finally put down roots.“I cherish that year so much because I begged my mom to let me go to a normal high school,” she said.That taste of a normal life was fleeting. Parade closed due to budgetary issues, and Romano said her agent asked her to come out to Los Angeles to audition for pilot season. Soon after, she got the news every child star hopes for: She had landed the leading role in a Disney Channel series, Even Stevens. Romano, at 16, would be playing Ren Stevens, a popular and high-achieving eighth-grader who deals with hijinks from her younger, goofy brother Louis, played by a then-unknown Shia LaBeouf. (In 2021, his former girlfriend FKA Twigs sued LaBeouf, accusing him of sexual battery and assault. In response to a New York Times article about the suit and allegations that other women have made against him, LaBeouf claimed that “many of these allegations aren’t true” but said he owed the women “the opportunity to air their statements publicly and accept accountability for those things I have done.”)
 


After landing the role of a lifetime, Romano was devastated. She had finally begun to carve out a space for herself in Connecticut, was dating a boy she was excited about, and was “super sad” about leaving her entire family behind. Her life had seemed like it was starting, and now it was all being taken away.“I’ve never really unpacked how that must have felt, but I know that it was very traumatizing,” she said.If she was so unhappy, though, why didn’t she just quit? Sure, her mom always told her if it wasn’t fun anymore she could stop, but Romano said she felt deep down it wasn’t that simple. (I reached out to Romano’s mother for comment both directly and through Romano’s publicist. I was told that her mother was unable to speak to me about what she recalls from this time period.)“My mom and I became a team ... and so I felt like I couldn’t let my teammate down,” she said. “And that might actually not have been the true case. I think my mom would have been just fine if I had stopped doing this. … I didn’t really know whether or not stopping was a true thing to do, but it felt like I’d be letting her down.” Advertisement  So she went, moving across the country with her mother to Los Angeles. When she arrived, she became part of Disney’s stable of teenage actors who would go on to become some of the most recognizable of the early 2000s: Hilary Duff, Raven-Symoné, and of course, LaBeouf. And while being on Disney Channel was nothing like being a normal high school student, some aspects of it felt like jockeying for a seat at the popular table.Lizzie McGuire premiered the year after Even Stevens, and soon became a huge hit.“We did have to compete a little bit with the Lizzie McGuire show,” she said.Even Stevens never reached the success of Lizzie McGuire, although Romano’s next project, the animated Kim Possible, got better ratings. Romano’s profile also rose when she appeared alongside Duff in the 2002 Disney Channel original movie, Cadet Kelly, which has since developed a cult following.
 


Still, Romano describes herself as somewhat of an outsider. As their shows took off, Duff and other Disney stars like Lindsay Lohan became more famous, releasing albums and gracing the covers of magazines and gossip columns. “I wasn’t trying to be a pop star right off the bat,” she said. “Hilary and Lindsay, and even Raven, I think they had a lot of big plans and I had no big plans. I was really just trying to go to college.”For many teens from that generation, the lives of Disney stars became, as Romano put it, almost like a reality show. But Romano was never really in the tabloids.“I wasn’t invited to the party,” she said. “I don’t have a problem with it, but I legitimately at the time felt like I must not be interesting because [there just wasn’t] anything dramatic going on in my life.”
 


As Romano tells it, she hung around with some of her Even Stevens castmates but didn’t form any deep, lasting friendships.Her most popular confessional video, “Why I Don’t Talk to Shia LaBeouf,” has 1.8 million views, but doesn’t really divulge any gossip, mainly because, it seems, Romano and LaBeouf never had more than a surface-level relationship.Romano didn’t want to talk about the allegations against LaBeouf to me, saying she has avoided speaking publicly on it because she just wanted to address “how I knew him.” She said, though, that she knew he had a bad home life, that was worse than even most child stars. “I didn’t see it firsthand, but I knew it was happening and I could hear it happening and I could sense it happening,” she said. But, she added, she had her “own shit going on.” In the video, Romano says that while they were more coworkers than friends, she regrets not giving LaBeouf “a little more time and energy and love,” as she reflects on what he was dealing with behind the scenes.When Even Stevens wrapped, Romano had a choice to make. She had landed a role in a pilot on a network show, and she had also been accepted to Barnard College in New York. When the pilot ultimately didn’t work out, Romano made a decision that her agent questioned at the time: She decided to go to school. The choice felt like a revelation, something that she had chosen to do on her own, without worrying about what people in the industry thought.“If there’s one thing I hate is waiting around for Hollywood to decide what to do with you,” she said. “It’s a killer of life.”For years her life had been dictated by her career. She learned how to ride a bike for a commercial, not on her block for pleasure. If she wanted to try any extreme sports, like skiing or snowboarding, she told me she had to get clearance from the production. If she injured her face or broke a bone, she could create headaches for a whole team of people. Her body wasn’t her own.“There’s all these considerations, but not for your well-being — they’re for the well-being of the industry,” she said. “It’s basically, almost like you’re in the military, your body belongs to Hollywood, and … that never sat well with me.”Now, she said, her body and her life would finally belong to her.
 


Still, Romano said her initial college experience didn’t go so well. She felt so desperate to be normal, she dove right into what she thought she was supposed to do, living in the Barnard dorms. She dated a star athlete for a few months, but when they broke up, she felt “targeted” by others in his social circle. She speculates that most young women would have been able to navigate that situation, but she felt rocked by it.“I was pretty traumatized from school social hierarchy stuff, that’s pretty normal, but it would [have been] more normal if I had been in high school and dealt with it,” she said. “In college, it didn’t help me learn. I was super distracted.”When she had the opportunity to audition for Belle in Beauty and the Beast on Broadway, she jumped at it. She got the part in 2004 and dropped out of school. After the show wrapped, she spent about five years trying to get back into acting, taking parts in made-for-television movies and voice-acting work, and even working as a traveling acting coach.
 


It was a turbulent time. At 21, she said, she told her mom, who had worked closely with her on her career up until that point, they could no longer work together, and the two didn’t speak for a year. She felt directionless and was more focused on partying and dating than figuring out what she wanted to do with her life. She wasted her hard-earned money and drank too much. When she went to auditions, she felt angry and entitled. How could she still be grinding so hard to make a living when she had sacrificed so much for this career? She described the period as a sort of “narcissistic purgatory.”“I think I started to kind of hate this business of acting,” she said.So at 26, she parted ways with her agents and went back to school at Columbia University. There she met her husband. Rooney was also a later-in-life student, attending college on the GI Bill after having served in the military. She said he had no idea who she was when they met. Their lives couldn’t have been more different, but their experiences — child stardom and military service — were surprisingly congruent. Advertisement  
 


“Our baggage matched each other’s baggage,” she said. “We could blend our baggage set together and just roll along with each other to the next stop.”Still, even after getting her degree in film, with an eye to directing and producing, Romano struggled to figure out how to work in the industry on her own terms. She moved back to California with Rooney, so he could attend the American Film Institute, and “tried a lot of different things.” She even tried interning at ABC Studios, Disney’s parent company, which led to some awkward encounters.“I was literally sitting at the receptionist desk and the ABC studio executives would come by and they’d be like … ‘Aren’t you that girl?’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah,’” she said, describing it as “so fucking weird.”Despite the awkwardness, Romano found the experience empowering. She learned aspects of the business she had never understood when she was a child actor and felt like she was working toward something.“I felt really proud of myself, in a weird way, to show them that I was still alive,” she said. “Yeah, I was at the receptionist desk, but I’m still here. It was a quiet … ‘fuck you’ to them. I’m still here. You’re not going to forget me.”As much as Romano speaks out online about the bad parts of Hollywood and works outside the industry, she still seems to want to be part of it. She has nothing but good things to say about Disney as a company and tells me she’s nervous she would come off as bitter or a “whistleblower” in this piece. “I still believe in the wholesomeness of what Disney represents, and I don’t think that I would ever speak negatively about Disney or even Disney Channel,” she said. She added that she would jump at the chance to do an Even Stevens or Kim Possible reboot if the project felt right: “I’m always willing to do the work and work hard for Disney,” she says.But Romano couldn’t just wait around for Disney to notice her. As her 30s approached, she began to consider other ways to make money, and she found Comic-Con. It turned out that a lot of nostalgic millennials were curious about what stars like her were up to now. It was an easy and fulfilling way to make money, and also a revelation. She and Rooney discussed how she could tap into this fanbase that she hadn’t realized she had been leaving on the table.“We would sit there like, This seems to be an overwhelming amount of people wondering what I’m up to,” she said.
 


The answer to how to tap into that fan interest was obvious: social media. Prior to 2016, Romano’s Instagram account had mainly consisted of photos of herself on set for her various projects, and she didn’t have that many followers. Once she got pregnant with Isabella that year, though, she started to wonder if she had an opportunity to make money off her personal brand. Slowly but surely, she said, she began to understand the algorithm and “started to see what being a part of the influencer game meant.” She shared more of her family, got better at her photo game, and began to think about who her demographic could be. She started treating her social media as a business and soon got her first deal with a baby brand.“Because of that, I was able to move from a small condo in West Hollywood and into a house in Orange County,” she said. “And I was ready to have my first baby because of this endorsement.”For the first time in a long time, Romano felt financially secure. It was, she said, a “super cool” feeling.“When your whole life, you’re white-knuckling what the next chapter of your life is going to be ... it’s just kind of a not fun existence,” she said. “That’s why people tell people not to act.”Now though, with content creation? “The sky’s the limit,” she said.Romano officially launched her YouTube channel in June 2019 with a series called “Christy’s Kitchen Throwback.” Shortly before launching, she wrote an essay in Teen Vogue, titled “Christy Carlson Romano: My Private Breakdown,” describing many of the struggles she has since shared on YouTube, reintroducing herself to fans after a decade out of the spotlight, and promoting her channel as her comeback.“The beauty of the entertainment industry today is that you can create what you want to, a privilege that we didn’t have when I was coming up,” she wrote at the time. “With YouTube and the other social media platforms, smart, savvy people with talent can do it all themselves.”
 


The series took a formula Romano knew had potential from her Comic-Con days — catching up with child Disney channel stars — and married it with her own enjoyment of cooking. She had some viral hits; one video, where she made a recipe from Kim Possible with her former costar Will Friedle and dished on the series, got more than 2.5 million views. However, subsequent videos failed to match its success, even though they featured Disney favorites like Jason Earles from Hannah Montana and Sabrina Bryan from The Cheetah Girls. Romano seemed particularly bummed that a video re-creating the scene featuring “We Went to the Moon in 1969” from Even Stevens didn’t perform either.By this point, Rooney had graduated from the American Film Institute with an MFA in screenwriting, and he began to work closely with Romano on her YouTube channel. Romano credited Rooney as much of the brains behind her content, saying he has a great mind for “forecasting trends.”The couple dabbled in all types of content. They did challenge videos, and Romano shared her makeup routine and lifestyle tips. They tried family vlogging, and Romano set up verified Instagram accounts for her daughters (she eventually grew uncomfortable with them being public and made them private). She and Rooney even spent a lot of money on videos where they just gave cash to random people (“I Gave a Fan as Much Cash as They Could Catch,” “I Gave $5000 to Whoever Recognized Me From Disney Channel), for little return. Advertisement  After the family moved to Austin in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic (for the slower pace of life and to escape wildfire season), it became difficult to film the kitchen series with guests. At one point, Rooney and Romano discussed abandoning YouTube altogether, to focus on Instagram and TikTok, where it is easier to grow an audience. But they decided to press on. She had been finding success with mental health– and advice-themed TikToks and speculated that her audience liked the “vulnerability” of that content.“And so Brendan had an idea,” she said. “We fused together the concept of this ‘big sister in mental health,’ ‘Christy’s talking about her life’ thing. Memoir.”In August, she posted the first of these videos, “The Truth About the Disney Channel,” in a style that would become her signature. She walks on the trails near her home, speaking directly to the camera about her life in a seemingly stream of consciousness, off-the-cuff manner (Romano insisted to me that “99% of the time,” the videos are not scripted but her publicist declined to let me observe her film one). This first one got more than 400,000 views. Since then, she has found a large amount of success, getting written up frequently in the tabloids for her revelations and getting hundreds of thousands of views on her channel (her video about LaBeouf has the highest number, with more than 1.8 million). Advertisement     Finally, Romano was squarely back in the public eye. But she was gaining success by mining her own life and trauma, and by playing into some of the more cringe aspects of YouTube culture, like headlines that are clearly clickbait (“How Katy Perry Got My Record Deal” oversells the real story a bit).Romano shrugs about that aspect. Her attitude seems to be: Don’t hate the player, hate the game.“That’s the only way to get noticed,” she said, then corrected herself. “It’s not the only way to get noticed, but it’s the quickest way to get noticed.”The reactions to her videos generate more complicated feelings. She sees the tweets poking fun at her revelations, and some of them make her feel “shitty.” After living without public scrutiny for so long, being back in the conversation can feel triggering at times, but she’s learning to live with it. Advertisement     “You just have to kind of put your blinders on and just focus on the success of what you’re doing,” she said. “It’s teaching me a lot. So while it is triggering, I think it’s also an exercise in acceptance.”She also noted that, this time, it’s what she has chosen.“I had to check in with myself and say, ‘Is this worth it?’” she said. “And it is worth it because what I never did before was have an authentic point of view, and it’s what I regret probably most in my career. ... Now I’ve got a story. And so in giving that story a platform ... I can start again.”
 


Obviously, Romano eventually will run out of childhood stories to mine, although she told me she has many more ideas in the bag. (Shortly after our chat, she released two back-to-back: “What Donald Trump Is Really Like” and “What Bill Clinton Is Really Like.”) Advertisement     But after her story well runs dry, what’s next for Romano and her channel? She said her goal is to get to a million YouTube subscribers and to continue to grow her audience. The hope is that while people may go to her social media accounts for the nostalgia videos or confessionals, eventually they will stay for her. Leaning into being a lifestyle influencer, what Romano called the “Chrissy Teigen part of my life,” has been fun and fulfilling.“When I get to do that, I actually feel like, my gosh, I am performing again, like, I’m having fun putting these clothes on and putting this image out there,” she said. “For now that’s ... that’s good.”She also said she isn’t done with Hollywood, per se, but she wants to do things on her own terms. Rooney is saving up to start his own agency for social media and trend forecasting, and the plan is for it to eventually have a film arm. The couple would love to make their own feature films, and Romano would love to direct or produce (she’s especially interested in family films). She hasn’t completely ruled out acting again, although, she noted, “I can’t say that people are going to come to me to be in their films.”
 


“I used to love acting,” she said. “I do love acting. I don’t love the business of getting a job in acting. I think it’s just a racket.”For now, Romano is focused on simple things. She and Rooney are getting to the place now where, she said, “their front door is about as big as their back door,” meaning that they are bringing in about as much money as they are spending. They are leasing their current Austin home, but they are hoping to save up enough to be able to build their own house further from the city. Romano said she now has a great relationship with her mother, who recently moved to Austin to be closer to them and helps out with the girls.There’s one burning question I can’t get out of my head. There’s no way she would ever let her daughters become child actors, right?Her answer surprised me. Romano doesn’t want her kids to act, but it’s complicated because she knows that it could be something they want to do. She could use her connections, get Isabella or Sophia an agent, and start booking them work. It’s not what she wants, and the thought terrifies her. But if it’s their dream? Maybe she couldn’t say no.“I don’t really want it for them, and I will tell them that,” she said, sighing.She said that when she looks at her girls, with their blonde hair and huge blue eyes, she realizes how successful they probably would be in the industry. That’s what makes it so hard and so scary. She’s not ready for one of her daughters to tell her they want to be just like her. “I’m not ready for that conversation and that concept,” she said. “If I’m not ready, how can I be a good support system for her? … The last thing I want is to put her in a business and then feel trepidatious or cautious ... I wouldn’t want to do that to her.”“Maybe it will never come!” I suggested. “Maybe she just will want to do soccer?”“That’d be great,” Romano said, laughing, “because mostly I just don’t want to have to relive this experience. I just want to move on, you know. I want to figure out how to bottle the joy that I have right now, making content that makes people happy … I know that I have goals, but like ... if I could be here in five years, I’d be happy for that too.” ●

389,Don’t panic. But be cautious. We’ll know more in a couple of weeks.,"


Just as we were all looking forward to the holiday season, hoping to put the Delta coronavirus wave behind us, the World Health Organization sounded a fresh alarm on Nov. 26 about the Omicron variant. Announced by South African scientists just two days before, the WHO designated Omicron as an official “variant of concern” because it seems to be spreading quickly and may possess mutations that could help evade vaccines or immunity from prior infections.The first case of COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant in the U.S. was confirmed in San Francisco on Dec. 1, in a fully vaccinated person who had recently traveled to South Africa.When Delta began to threaten the US in early June, it had already caused a devastating COVID wave in India and gotten a strong foothold in the UK. With South Africa having alerted the world so quickly, scientists are still struggling to work out how dangerous this new variant might be. Advertisement     While we wait on that data, here are some key questions and what we know so far:How transmissible is Omicron compared to earlier variants?Omicron was first identified in South Africa and Botswana in November, and coincided with a rapid uptick in cases, especially in the Gauteng Province in South Africa’s Highveld. “In recent weeks, infections have increased steeply,” the WHO noted.That led to a flurry of genomic sequencing of viruses from patients in Gauteng. The extra volume of sequencing could make the virus seem to be spreading more quickly than it really is, Trevor Bedford of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, a specialist in viral evolution, noted on Twitter.What scientists now need to work out is whether Omicron is sufficiently transmissible to replace the currently dominant Delta coronavirus variant, which emerged in India in late 2020. From June 2021 in the US and in Europe, Delta quickly replaced the Alpha and Beta variants, first identified in the UK and South Africa respectively. Its high transmissibility is also believed to have prevented the Lambda variant, first identified in Peru in the summer of 2020 and once a big concern because it seemed to have some resistance to vaccines, from taking hold across the globe.It may take several weeks to work out how quickly Omicron spreads compared to Delta. “Omicron will turn out either to be Beta-like, and vanish, or a super-Delta, and a problem,” John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, told BuzzFeed News by email. “Time will tell.”Is it more or less deadly than earlier variants?Amid scary headlines about the Omicron variant, one initial hopeful sign came soon after the WHO's announcement, when Angelique Coetzee, a doctor in Pretoria who treated some of the first patients carrying the variant, told the UK’s Telegraph newspaper that they had relatively mild disease. “Their symptoms were so different and so mild from those I had treated before,” said Coetzee, who chairs the South African Medical Association.But other experts say it’s too early to tell whether Omicron is more or less deadly than earlier variants. On Nov. 28, Francois Balloux, director of the University College London Genetics Institute, tweeted: “The omicron variant could be less, as much, or more transmissible and/or virulent than prior SARSCoV2 lineages in circulation. Only real data will tell, and any prediction about omicron's virulence remains largely futile at this stage.” Advertisement     Answering this question means looking at rates of hospitalization and deaths among patients with the Omicron variant — controlling carefully for their age, which is a huge factor in how hard the coronavirus hits.“It should take a couple of weeks to have reasonably solid data on hospitalization rates,” Balloux told BuzzFeed News by email. “For mortality rates we will have to wait for a bit longer. The first good evidence should come out of South Africa as they have reported the highest number of cases to date.”Why are scientists concerned about Omicron?Omicron has at least 30 mutations in the spike protein that the coronavirus uses to enter human cells, 15 of which are in the part of the protein that actually binds to its target receptor. Worryingly, some of these mutations are known from earlier variants to make the coronavirus more transmissible. One, seen in the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants, improves the ability of the virus to bind to its receptor. Other mutations may help the coronavirus evade antibodies. But Omicron also contains novel mutations whose effects are not yet known, so predicting how it will behave is difficult.In its Nov. 26 statement, the WHO pointed not only to the rapid rise of Omicron in South Africa, but also the fact that it seems more likely than other variants to infect people who have previously had a case of COVID. “Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant,” the WHO said.How should I change my behavior?As with previous variants including Delta, all the usual measures we can take to reduce viral transmission will help reduce the spread of Omicron. The WHO’s Nov. 26 statement said: “Individuals are reminded to take measures to reduce their risk of COVID-19, including proven public health and social measures such as wearing well-fitting masks, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving ventilation of indoor spaces, avoiding crowded spaces, and getting vaccinated.”Bob Wachter, chair of UCSF’s School of Medicine, stressed the same advice in a tweet:
 


In the US, successive waves of COVID have turned around and started to subside after about two months of steady growth. This often seems to happen when people see news reports of local hospitals becoming overwhelmed by seriously ill people.“It’s right around that point that we note that behavior rapidly changes and the surge subsides,” Spencer Fox, associate director of the University of Texas COVID-19 Modeling Consortium, told BuzzFeed News last week, before news about Omicron broke.The challenge now is to convince people to modify their behavior before things have gotten out of control. Unfortunately, the emergence of Omicron comes just as cases in the US were already starting to tick up again after the decline of the first Delta wave.In a press briefing on Nov.29, President Joe Biden encouraged Americans to get vaccinated or get a booster shot if they haven’t yet done so. He also urged people to “please wear your mask when you’re indoors, in public settings, around other people,” but indicated that no new mask mandates and lockdown restrictions are planned at this time.Should I cancel holiday travel plans?Current CDC recommendations are to delay travel unless you are vaccinated. Factors to consider in weighing whether to travel include the transmission rate where you are headed, and where you will travel through. “If you and your family are fully vaccinated, you can celebrate the holidays much more safely,” Biden said.Some data on whether the Omicron variant is more contagious or severe than Delta could emerge by the middle of December, which might affect your plans.Experts mostly continue to recommend the same precautions as they did before the Omicron news. If you are flying, vaccination, boosters, and mask-wearing are the three most important things you can do, said Reynold A. Panettieri Jr., vice chancellor for Translational Medicine and Science at Rutgers University.“I would undoubtedly use a mask and practice social distancing and hand-washing on the plane or in the airport,” he said. “I certainly would not lower my guard at this point, we just don’t know about the variant.” Advertisement     As for holiday parties, Panettieri recommends that you weigh the risks and take into consideration the attendees’ vaccination status.“Parties tend to be loud, there tends to be dancing and shouting and celebration,” all of which can spread viruses, he said. “I think you have to be cautious.”Smaller parties where you know all the individuals and can practice social distancing and hand washing are “probably going to be fine,” Panettieri said.Will international travel bans make any difference?Starting Nov.29, the US restricted travel from South Africa and seven other countries in the region — although citizens and permanent residents are still allowed to return to the country. But it’s highly unlikely that this will keep Omicron from spreading in the US. The first US case was confirmed Dec. 1 and the variant was previously detected in countries including Belgium, Germany, Italy, Australia, and the UK.“Travel bans can buy time if you’re in front of a virus, but I don’t think we’re in front of it,” Ingrid Katz of the Harvard Global Health Institute told BuzzFeed News over the weekend.Some experts think that travel bans are futile and are sending a dangerous message by effectively punishing the countries that raised the global health alarm. At best, they may provide a little more time to prepare for an Omicron surge. The UK, for instance, was hit earlier by the Delta variant than most other European countries, likely because of large numbers of people traveling from India during the height of its Delta wave. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was heavily criticized by opposition politicians for not imposing restrictions on travel from India more quickly.Biden acknowledged the limits of travel bans in his press conference on Nov.29. “The point of the restriction [is] to give us time to get people to get protection, to be vaccinated and get the booster,” he said.Will existing vaccines work against Omicron?Experts don’t expect Omicron to completely evade our current vaccines. The big question is whether its spike protein contains enough important changes from earlier variants that antibodies generated by the shots distributed so far will be less effective at neutralizing the virus.To answer this question, scientists will first conduct lab tests to see whether the Omicron variant is able to partially evade neutralizing antibodies. “It will take 1 to 2 weeks to generate lab-based data on the antibody-resistance properties of the omicron spike,” Moore told BuzzFeed News by email. Advertisement     On Nov. 26, Moderna announced that it is testing three existing vaccine booster candidates against Omicron. Two of these were designed to work against multiple variants and contain mutations from the Beta and Delta variants that are also present in Omicron.If they don’t work well, how quickly could a vaccine against Omicron be made?One advantage of mRNA vaccines like the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots is that they can be redesigned and put into mass production far more quickly than older vaccines. BioNTech has said that it could produce and start shipping an Omicron-specific vaccine within 100 days, if necessary. In a statement to investors, Moderna suggested a variant-specific vaccine could be ready by early 2022.Johnson & Johnson, the maker of the other US-authorized vaccine, said on Nov.26 that it is also working on a variant-specific vaccine. The company is right now testing blood serum from its booster study participants to measure vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron variant. Its vaccine is a modified version of a harmless cold virus engineered to alert the immune system to coronavirus spike proteins, which would take longer to customize for a specific variant.Should I get vaccinated and get a booster? Or wait for an Omicron-specific shot?Get vaccinated and get a booster, public health experts are advising, rather than waiting for a variant-specific shot. That’s because existing vaccines will still provide some protection against infection and even more against severe disease. A vaccine creates antibodies that should still target some of the unmutated parts of the spike protein on the variant. A booster creates 5 times more antibodies than a two-dose vaccine does, and 50 times more than infection by the virus, according to a recent study.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky on Nov. 29 updated the agency’s booster recommendations to state that everyone 18 and older “should” get a booster, citing concerns about the Omicron variant.How well will antiviral COVID-19 therapies work against Omicron?Oral antiviral drugs from Merck and Pfizer — which appear to be very effective at treating COVID-19 — are expected to work well against disease caused by the Omicron variant. The medications (both of which could receive emergency use authorization from the FDA in the next few weeks) target viral replication, which is less affected by the mutations found in Omicron. One Merck study earlier found its antiviral drug, molnupiravir, was equally effective against several earlier variants, although research on its specific effectiveness against Omicron is ongoing.However, this doesn’t mean antivirals can fully blunt the Omicron threat. On Nov.26, Merck reported that its antiviral pill may be significantly less effective than it initially appeared. In its final analysis ahead of an FDA review, the company reported a 30% reduction in hospitalizations and death among high-risk patients, much lower than the 50% reported in early estimates. Advertisement     Vaccines remain the preferred tool to fight COVID-19 because they can prevent infections and reduce spread — minimizing the opportunity for the virus to mutate further.Where did this new variant come from?Although the first confirmed COVID cases caused by the Omicron variant were detected from South Africa and Botswana — the earliest sample was collected on Nov. 9, according to WHO — that doesn’t necessarily mean that the virus emerged in either of those countries. Indeed, Omicron’s mutations indicate that it may have diverged from other variants more than a year ago, Bedford noted on Twitter. If so, it could have been circulating for months under the radar somewhere without good surveillance for new variants — likely elsewhere in Africa.Another possibility is that the virus acquired its mutations while chronically infecting someone with a compromised immune system, which has been documented in the past. The high prevalence of HIV across Africa means that there would have been many opportunities for this to happen. “The two scenarios are not mutually incompatible,” Balloux told BuzzFeed News by email.Uncertainty around the origins of Omicron provides another reason why selective travel bans aimed at countries in southern Africa may be ineffective.Why is it called Omicron?In May this year, WHO started naming variants after Greek letters, to be less confusing than scientific designations, which involve combinations of letters and numbers — so B.1.617.2 became Delta. This variant was expected to be called Nu, the next letter in the Greek alphabet, but WHO avoided that name because of the potential for confusion with “new.” WHO also skipped Xi. Even though the Greek letter is pronounced differently, this wasn’t used because Xi is the transliteration of a common Chinese name, a WHO official told the New York Times. (It is also the name of China’s president.) Omicron was next on the list.This is a developing story. Check back for updates and follow BuzzFeed News on Twitter.‏

390,"“I’m not here to shame any individuals on how they shop because I think the onus is on brands,” said one sustainable fashion campaigner.","


Cyber Monday sales may get customers filling their carts, but popular online retailer PrettyLittleThing has been criticized for its promotional stunt of a 100% discount.Yes, the fast fashion merchant, a fixture among influencers thanks to its trendy pieces and celebrity collaborations, has been giving away free clothes to a select few quick enough to grab them.
 


The Black Friday promotion of items listed for $0 was branded “sickening” and “unethical” by critics concerned with the lack of sustainability in fast fashion.“Every single week we're uncovering new clothing waste sites,” Venetia La Manna, a fair fashion campaigner and podcaster, told BuzzFeed News, calling the marketing gimmick “totally unsustainable.” The environmental impact of fast fashion brands has turned nations, such as Ghana in West Africa, into dump sites for textile waste.
 


La Manna was among the critics who questioned the brand’s actions on Twitter, resulting in her being blocked by PrettyLittleThing owner Umar Kamani.“You can't be working for a fashion brand in 2021 and not know the impacts of the harm that brand is causing and unfortunately, every fast fashion CEO seems to get away with it by just feigning ignorance,” said the 32-year-old activist.An estimated 15 million used garments make their way from the UK, Europe, North America, and Australia to end up in Ghana’s capital of Accra every week for the city’s enormous clothing market. However, 40% of it is of such poor quality that it ends up in a landfill, according to a report by ABC. Advertisement     
 


Last year, PrettyLittleThing’s Black Friday campaign grabbed headlines when it gave shoppers the chance to grab 25-pence (33 cents in USD) stilettos and 8-pence (10 cents) bodycon dresses. For 2021, the company has gone a step further by eliminating, in some instances, the price tag.“If you're willing to give away your clothes for free, what happens next?” asked La Manna. “And what I would say that says more than anything is how little they value their product.”And, the activist warned, the economic byproduct of such marketing ploys would have negative ramifications for workers.
 


The retailer is part of the Boohoo Group, which is owned by British billionaire Mahmud Kamani alongside Carol Kane. An investigation by the Sunday Times last year revealed that workers in factories making its clothes in the UK were being paid as little as $4.37 an hour and flouting COVID safety measures at the height of the pandemic.“It's not just happening in countries like Bangladesh,” said La Manna. “It's also happening on UK soil.”In a statement to BuzzFeed News, a PrettyLittleThing spokesperson said the promotion is part of an orchestrated marketing strategy and insisted that the staggering discounts had no bearing on suppliers.“The items on sale are carefully selected and discounting is a marketing investment that we make and is incorporated into our costing model, it does not in any way impact the cost price we pay to suppliers, or the way we value the work that goes into creating the garments,” PLT said the statement. Advertisement     The PLT spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about whether it considered itself an ethical brand or measured the environmental impact of its clothing, only saying that its pricing campaign was one that allowed customers access to the brand “no matter what their budget.”As scientists warn of the long-term environmental consequences of fast fashion, major discount marketing gimmicks are signs that the industry is “out of whack” and “that fast fashion seems to be eating itself,” said La Manna.Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales are specifically creating a sense of urgency for customers, particularly in brands that rely on constant turnover on cheap trend products. La Manna believes that the bulk of criticism should be directed at brands rather than consumers, who are sometimes victims of aggressive marketing campaigns and a strong influencer culture.“We're all coming at fashion from different points of privilege, we all have different levels of access,” said La Manna. “I'm not here to shame any individuals on how they shop because I think the onus is on brands, I think PrettyLittleThing and Boohoo and all big brands have a responsibility to drastically reduce their output.”

391,Guy Reffitt is set to face a jury in February.,"


WASHINGTON — A string of Thanksgiving eve filings in the case of Guy Reffitt — a Texas man charged with bringing a handgun to the US Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot — offered an early glimpse into what a trial in the unprecedented prosecution effort will look like.Reffitt’s Feb. 28 trial date is tentative, but his case is the farthest along in terms of preparation. It’s the first case where prosecutors and the defense submitted a list of proposed jury questions, along with pretrial motions about what testimony and evidence can go before jurors. The draft questionnaire sheds light on what both sides want to know about the people who could decide Reffitt’s fate — specifically, what prospective jurors know about Jan. 6, where they get their news, and whether their political beliefs could get in the way of being fair. Advertisement     Reffitt, meanwhile, lodged an objection to the government using language to describe certain evidence that he contends is “opinion testimony,” such as “breach” and “confrontation.”The political and cultural fault lines drawn around Jan. 6 have seeped into the courtroom over the past year, with some defendants claiming they’re political prisoners while others distance themselves from their previous support for former president Donald Trump. Any fights over what information and opinions jurors bring with them and what language lawyers use at trial will mirror fights that have played out for months in the public arena over how to describe what happened — An insurrection? A riot? Terrorism? A “tourist” visit? — and how the Justice Department and Congress have handled their respective investigations.Trial dates are on the calendar in at least 17 cases related to the attack on the Capitol, including a multi-defendant conspiracy case against members of the Oath Keepers extremist group, according to BuzzFeed News’ review of court records. The latter half of the year was marked by a flurry of guilty pleas — nearly 150 defendants have taken a deal with the government so far — but developments in cases like Reffitt’s highlight the fact that other defendants have dug in for a fight.Most defendants are being prosecuted individually instead of en masse. Whichever cases have reached a milestone first — from pretrial detention orders to plea hearings and sentencings — have provided a model for judges, prosecutors, and defense lawyers across these cases to build on, even if the case-specific facts and allegations are different. The same will be true of whichever cases are the first to go to trial. Advertisement     
 


Reffitt is charged with bringing a rifle and a semi-automatic handgun to Washington to support a civil disorder, carrying the latter firearm to the Capitol, and charging at police officers, who deployed projectiles and pepper spray to keep him back, according to the government. He’s facing a felony count for obstructing Congress’s certification of the election by joining the mob that descended on the Capitol complex. He’s also charged with threatening his children if they shared incriminating information with law enforcement.Reffitt is one of several defendants challenging the government’s decision to pursue the obstruction count in connection with Jan. 6. Reffitt has argued that Congress’s activities in a joint session that day weren’t the type of “official proceeding” that the obstruction statute was meant to cover, and that language in the law about a person needing to act “corruptly” is unconstitutionally vague. Other defendants have pressed similar arguments. No judge has ruled on the issue yet. It’s the most common felony charged across the Capitol riot cases, and a loss for the government could dramatically change the scope of the prosecution effort.US District Judge Dabney Friedrich heard the latest round of arguments in Reffitt’s case on Nov. 19, but in the meantime kept in place a schedule she’d already set for pretrial filings. If Reffitt wins dismissal of the obstruction count, he’ll still face multiple counts related to the firearms charges and the allegation that he interfered with the investigation by threatening his children against cooperating.Several jury questions proposed by the government reflect the massive amount of media coverage of Jan. 6 and the hundreds of arrests that followed. Knowing something about a case doesn’t automatically disqualify a person from serving on a jury, but the lawyers will probe what potential jurors know, where they got that information from, and how much it could color their thinking about Reffitt and the allegations against him, either in his favor or against it. Advertisement     A few of these questions, which Reffitt did not object to, explore if jurors know anyone with a “direct or indirect connection” to Jan. 6 or have such a connection themselves, and attempt to quantify just how much information about the riot a prospective juror has consumed.One question reads: “Have you ever watched video of what happened at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 on the news or on the Internet? If yes, how many times have you seen videos of that event, in whole or in part, on TV or on the internet? (1 time, 2-3 times, 4-5 times, 6 or more times).”Another question proposed by the government uses the same numerical format to ask how much a potential juror has heard specifically about Reffitt and his case. Prosecutors also want to ask specific questions about where jurors get their news from, as well as, “In what ways, if any, could your political views, or those of your spouse, affect your service as a juror in this case?”Prosecutors and Reffitt’s lawyer William Welch III offered two versions of a question about whether jurors who were already familiar with what happened on Jan. 6 could still be fair.The government wants to ask: “No matter what you have heard or seen about events at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, and no matter what opinions you may have formed, can you put all of that aside and decide this case only on the evidence you receive in court, follow the law, and decide the case in a fair and impartial manner?”Welch pitched an alternative: “Does anyone have such strong feelings about events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021 that would make it difficult to be a fair juror in this case?”Friedrich also gave both sides until Nov. 24 to file motions related to trial evidence, and Reffitt filed one challenging the captions that prosecutors used in a set of Capitol surveillance videos. Welch wrote that they didn’t object to including the time and location of a recording, but argued that descriptions such as “Rioters Approach,” “Breach,” “Confrontation,” and “Police Line” were hearsay and amounted to “opinion testimony.” Advertisement     Last month, prosecutors filed two motions related to trial evidence. The first asked for the judge’s permission to allow an FBI special agent to testify about a gun holster found in Reffitt’s home and compare it to a photo of Reffitt from the Capitol that prosecutors say show him with that holster attached to his hip. That filing was the first time the government publicly shared what it said was photo evidence of the handgun.The government also asked to limit the types of questions that Reffitt’s lawyer could ask of a US Secret Service witness who prosecutors planned to call to testify about how the riot affected their protection of former vice president Mike Pence and his family. Prosecutors don’t want the defense to ask for details about how agents protected Pence and his family or generally about Secret Service protocols in emergency situations.Friedrich is set to take up the trial evidence issues at a pretrial hearing on Jan. 6, 2022 — the one-year anniversary of the riot.

392,"“I feel like photographing my friends is a way of me adding to history and adding history to these places. These nights, they will never happen again.”","


Tyrell Hampton is the guy at the party who everyone wants to be friends with. His whole vibe is super fun. I want to be friends with him — and trust me, I don't want to be friends with anyone during an interview on a Thursday night when I'm sick at home. He has that level of charisma, so it makes sense his career as a photographer has taken off.The 23-year-old came out with his first book last year, photographed the Met Gala this year, and has his first exhibition, Go Home, up in Manhattan now. He regularly works with brands like Coach and Yves Saint Laurent, is somewhat TikTok famous, and hangs out with famous people, but he, himself, is not actually famous, or so he says. Advertisement  Originally a dancer, he got his start sneaking into fashion shows in New York, becoming familiar with the scene, and taking pictures while going to school for photography at Parsons School of Design. Many of his photos are of people at clubs or, even better, of those after-hours, in-between moments of friends at parties that make the world feel exciting. That his friends are young and beautiful certainly helps, but Hampton has a knack for capturing people in an authentic, raw state without it feeling overly voyeuristic.His first show is something of a coming-out as a serious artist and a logical next step for someone who can't seem to sit down. The included frames feel like a sneak peek into the lives of the cool kids — like the best part of social media, without all the bullshit and artifice. Looking at his images makes you want to go out with your friends, and they belie the idea that something beautiful has to be perfectly constructed.Hampton spoke with us in a wide-ranging interview about what makes a good party, how he manifested friendships with his idols, and his relationship with his mom. His show is up until Jan. 9 at the Seaport. Advertisement  
 


You've become famous for taking party photos. Do you see it as work? Is there a divide in your brain if you're just going out to chill versus if you're on assignment for someone?I rarely accept party photography jobs, mainly because it's so personal to me, which is why I also don't really commodify my dancing. It's my peace in my world — if I do it too often for money and see it as a job, my brain would not be able to take it seriously. Advertisement  So it's very rare, but when I'm in those spaces and I have to work, it's really interesting. For a GQ party or, like, the Met Gala, people are on me. There's a WhatsApp group chat, and it's like being tugged in so many different directions — like, “we need a photo of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez right now.” It won't really be what I want it to be, because I have to get it and it has to be perfect and beautiful and a portrait, instead of me sneaking up on them in a way that is more so candid and natural.This is why I also look up to Daniel Arnold. I got to watch him at the Met Gala. I got to watch him roam free. It's so good how he takes photos, just walking around, like, not even a camera to his eye. It's more so just like the situations he finds. It's quite beautiful.If I'm just at a party, I can really take my time and I'm more so like the director or like the voice of reason in terms of what situations I actually find appealing and that I find beautiful and visually pleasing and all those things. Advertisement  In your mind, what makes a good party?Music, 100%. I was talking about this with someone earlier. I want to hear something that I can sing along to — I feel the most free. So I usually am at a place where I can find music that I really resonate with and sing along to, that's when I'm like, I'm good.When you clean your house, you clean it to music that you can sing along to, so it feels like you're not doing the work. And I feel like when I'm at a club, to make me feel like I'm not running around being crazy, I tend to find places that like playing music that I enjoy. Then I'm really just in my own head. I'm just vibing out, and it's the best, best thing ever.What kind of music are you into?I love Omar Apollo, I love City Girls, The Delfonics...I love rap music, basically. And Dua. But of course I have to give it to my girl.
 


How does it feel to be famous and to have famous friends?I definitely don't think I am famous whatsoever, but I guess I have, um, notable people around me. It definitely makes me feel important. And it's something that I guess I've been manifesting for as long as I can remember. I've always been the child that was like, I want to be around like-minded people, I want to be around people who like the same things that I do and value the same things that I do, like art and music and fashion and stuff.So the fact that they're, I guess, famous, it's icing on the cake. It's like having Addison Rae — although people know her as a TikToker, she and I have really bonded over our love of Kesha and art, and we just love doing things. We're just really outrageous in the things that we like to do. Like, we'll cross the street on a red light just for the thrill, just screaming in the street. She's just really fun to be around, and we can just vibe off of each other. So it's quite nice.Then are you an extrovert or an introvert?I think most people would say I'm an extrovert because I really do not get shy ever, but I would like to think that I have moments where... I'm not an introvert, but I'm really perceptive. Especially taking photos at nightclubs, I really need to take time and be like, what is my scene? What is going on in front of me? Where am I going? What's happening? Is this a safe space for me? There's those questions I asked myself before being like, I can be myself. Advertisement  You trained as a dancer and then pivoted to party photography, which I think is fantastic. Can you talk about that?I grew up in Philly, and, my mom can attest to this, I've always been just a colorful, energetic person, just really irreverent and cannot sit down. So that translated into dancing, which then translated into going to performing arts high school and living out my high school musical dream and dancing every day.I didn't really have a childhood that was what I would like to think would be normal, in terms of going outside and really hanging out with friends and stuff like that. I would be at school, and at dance after school, on the weekends, and during the summer, just continuing training, training, training. I didn't really have that much free time to go out and really explore those milestones that most people get to do. I've never drank or smoked before, which is, I guess, interesting.When I moved to New York for college and it was like, I'm finally free after class, I can go for a walk and go for lunch with friends — all of these little things that I really appreciate. That's when I took the chance to really document those moments, because they were important to me. Going out to the club was a photo op. I realized I really just loved the club, because that was when I was most free. It was a dark room; there were people that I didn't really know who I wanted to know. Cute boys. There were so many different elements that came together, and it made me really feel at home in my brain. So it was only right that my physical body was just, like, just having fun as well.

One of the reasons I really like your images is that people want to see what the authentic or behind-the-scenes version of a person is, and your pictures provide a good peek at that. Advertisement  I think it's funny because I'm still a fan at the end of the day. I feel like that's what aligns me with people who like my work; they're as much fans of these people as I am. Like, seeing people out in the club and stuff, it's still surreal to me. So to be around them and to take their photos, I'm still a kid in the candy store. I'm like, you want me to be around you? I'm taking photos of you eating a burger, and this is cool.Best fangirling story?There are two people in the entire world that I'm obsessed with, and that is Frank Ocean and Alexander Wang, and I have been able to manifest friendships with both of them. I would like to call Wang my friend. I don't know. But after sneaking into Wang shows and photographing all his models and becoming friends with them and stuff like that, I really became a familiar face, and that's how I got hired to shoot his shows more often and then be at his house parties and things like that.To meet Frank, and to have him as a person in my corner, is really, really rewarding. He and I have these conversations about art in ways that I don't think I ever did in college. It's really philosophical. We really go deep into what we think about music and photography and the type of images we like and what we like in homes and architecture and things like that. Advertisement  I think those two were probably like my biggest fangirl moments. And I hold them dear to my heart. They're, like, really good friends with me now.I love that you've met all of the people of your dreams.My mom always said, you know, “Really speak it into existence.” I will work that show. I will meet this person.What are you trying to speak into existence now?There's so many things! I think right now it's more about, This is the first step. Making my work more tangible and letting people sit with it and letting them explore its nuances and things like that in a close-up sort of way is definitely something I'm trying to manifest within the next couple of years. Also working with more brands that I've been obsessed with since I was younger, like Saint Laurent and Gucci.I want to work with them because they work with my friends. My best friend, Jordan, she just did 7 for All Mankind. She does fashion week. Now that she and I are sort of established in our careers, it would be so beautiful to work with her in a way that commemorates our friendship and commemorates our love for the industry.

I feel like that's the work that I'm more intrigued by, when you have a friendship with the models and you see work by people who love each other. One of my favorite works is Mario Sorrenti and Kate Moss. That work [shows] they're in love, and that makes it so much more interesting to look at, because you see that Kate Moss trusts this person, and she's letting her guard down. I feel like I can make those images with someone like Frank or someone like Jordan or Binx or Addison [Rae] or Hailey [Bieber].That's why hopefully I'm getting the jobs that I'm getting, because I'm like, we're just going to go for a walk, and then I'm going to photograph you in these clothes, but it's not about the clothes, it's about our walk and what we're doing. Advertisement     You mentioned your mom is coming into this show, and it sounds like you're pretty close. Has she seen this work before? What does she think about your pictures?I grew up Muslim — she's since changed to Buddhism. It was interesting growing up Muslim and, like, listening to prayer on the way to school. As anyone who's [Muslim] and reading this probably knows, the prayer is not fluid and it's not musical. So it was very interesting growing up like that and being so interested in art.I was really embedded in that culture, but as I grew up and came into myself, it was like, I don't really think I resonate with this. My mom had to find a way to balance letting me and my room be what it was going to be. She's been really supportive since the beginning.She's seen my work; she loves my photography. She's always excited to hear about it. And she's my greatest supporter. My brother, on the other hand, is 14, and he's like, What are you doing with your life? Trying to be cool to a younger brother who is really into sports and not really into social media and stuff is really, really interesting, but we love food and we connect on our level.Tell me a little bit about the show. How did you curate all of this together?We had a pandemic, well, now, still to this day, and I got signed earlier this year to the agency. I made a book around this time last year. So I was like, it's time that I showcase something that puts me into a new conversation. Advertisement     A majority of the photos are black and white, besides one little piece, because there's something about it that is historical to me. I feel like photographing my friends is a way of me adding to history and adding history to these places. These nights, they will never happen again. You know what I mean?In talking with [the talent agency] SN37 about this idea of having a black-and-white show and what it means to have work on sale, I was also thinking about people's homes, and what I felt resonated there, and also that felt like it was my work. I just was trying to basically put all these pieces into a puzzle. I'm scared and excited to see what people think.I have two pieces that are in the show that I printed like a year ago. I was like, if this can work in my home and people are still enamored by it, then maybe it'll work in someone else's. And, surprisingly, I didn't do the whole printing thing. I printed mine at Duane Reade, and I got my frame from Amazon, but I promise the show has better framing and printing quality right now.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

393,"“If the court overrules Roe, ... we will see chaos for women, for the courts, for people around the country as the ripple effects are felt in many states — not just in the states that ban.”","


The moment reproductive rights advocates have feared for years is here.On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case that poses the biggest challenge yet to Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that made abortion legal nationwide almost 50 years ago.While much of the recent conversation about threats to abortion access has centered on Texas — where a novel legal design has allowed the state to halt almost all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy — the court’s arguments this week will focus on a 15-week ban in Mississippi. It marks the first time since Roe that the court is set to rule on the constitutionality of a law that prohibits abortion before a fetus is viable — that is, before it can survive outside the womb. It’s also the first major abortion case to be taken up by the court since the conservative majority grew to 6–3 with the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in 2020. (The court recently heard arguments on Texas’s ban, but in that case, the justices are only considering whether anyone can sue the state to challenge the law’s constitutionality.) Advertisement     For years, laws like Mississippi’s have been struck down by the lower courts as unconstitutional because under Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 ruling that said restrictions cannot place an “undue burden” on access, states cannot ban abortion before the point of viability, which is usually around 24 weeks.Now, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the state of Mississippi is calling on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe and Casey and uphold its 15-week ban. If the court does either — or both — large swaths of the South and Midwest will likely try to eliminate abortion access. People who can afford to travel may be able to receive care in other states where abortion is protected, but those who can’t will have to face the risks of carrying unwanted pregnancies to term or ending them in another — and potentially unsafe — way.“If the court overrules Roe, takes this right away, allows states to ban abortion at virtually any point in pregnancy, we will see chaos for women, for the courts, for people around the country as the ripple effects are felt in many states — not just in the states that ban,” said Julie Rikelman, senior director of litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Jackson Women's Health, the only remaining abortion clinic in Mississippi.It’s difficult to say at this point what the Supreme Court will actually do. Here’s what we know about the potential outcomes and what’s at stake.What would the Mississippi law do if allowed to take effect?Signed into law in March 2018, the Mississippi Gestational Age Act prohibits abortions after 15 weeks in gestation except when the life of the pregnant person is in danger or if there is ""a severe fetal abnormality"" that would prevent the fetus from surviving outside the womb. Doctors who violate the law would have their licenses suspended or revoked and could face a fine. Advertisement     The law was immediately put on hold after Jackson Women’s Health sued the state and then repeatedly blocked by the district and appellate courts. If the Supreme Court reverses the lower court’s judgment and upholds the state’s ban, it would take effect immediately.What’s at stake?If the Supreme Court overturns Roe or weakens it by upholding Mississippi’s 15-week ban or eliminating the viability standard, 26 states would likely try to prohibit abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research and advocacy group that tracks state legislation. As of Nov. 1, 22 states already have laws in place that they could use to enforce abortion bans. Of those, 12 have passed so-called trigger bans that are designed to take effect immediately or through quick state action if Roe is overturned, according to the institute.In a post-Roe or post–viability standard world, those who live in areas where abortion is illegal and can afford to travel out of state will likely travel to a state where it is still accessible. But, as we’ve seen in the wake of Texas’s six-week ban, those patients may overwhelm facilities in the 15 states — plus Washington, DC — with laws in place to protect abortion. And that could result in delays in care for everyone.Shannon Brewer, director of Jackson Women’s Health, said that as a result of Texas’s law taking effect, her clinic has increased the number of days they see patients from two or three to five or six days a week to deal with the influx of patients from the state.“They’re panicking, they don't know what to do because they’re calling surrounding states, and a lot of those states [are] all booked up three or four weeks,” Brewer said during a Nov. 15 media briefing. “That's just one state that did that, so just imagine if the Supreme Court turns everything over to the states and says that any state can ban an abortion.”But the patients who may be able to get an abortion elsewhere will probably represent a small fraction of those who need care. In 2014, 75% of abortion patients had low incomes, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Advertisement     In Mississippi, due to the financial burden and other restrictions that make it harder for people to access abortion — and create delays in qualifying for the procedure — a ruling upholding the state’s 15-week ban would disproportionately impact poor, young, and Black women, Brewer said.“They are going to be pushed further and further into poverty,” she said.How are politics influencing the case?
 


It was only after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death and Barrett’s confirmation — giving the Supreme Court a clear conservative majority for the first time in decades — that Mississippi said it would seek to overturn Roe.In June 2020, when Mississippi first petitioned the court to hear its case, the state suggested it had much smaller ambitions. “To be clear, the questions presented in this petition do not require the Court to overturn Roe or Casey,” the state attorney general’s office wrote. “They merely ask the Court to reconcile a conflict in its own precedents.In a brief filed this July, nine months after Barrett’s confirmation, the state’s attorneys wrote, “Overruling Roe and Casey makes resolution of this case straightforward.”Though the court has limited its scope to just one question, “Whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional,” the decision to take up the case at all signaled that the justices may be willing not only to chip away at abortion rights, but also potentially to dismantle the precedents that have protected them.What is each side arguing?In court filings, Mississippi’s attorneys argued that the Constitution does not protect the right to abortion, and that Roe’s holding that the right to privacy protects a pregnant person’s bodily autonomy to choose whether to have an abortion is substantially different than any other liberty identified by the Supreme Court because it entails “the purposeful termination of a potential life.” They also argued that Casey’s requirement that restrictions not place an “undue burden” on abortion access before viability unfairly impedes states from creating local abortion regulations. Advertisement     “Roe and Casey are egregiously wrong,” they wrote.The state is also claiming that the improved ability of women to “attain both professional success and a rich family life,” the wider accessibility of contraception and adoption, and the knowledge that a fetus has taken on the human form before viability have essentially made abortion unnecessary. “Innumerable women and mothers have reached the highest echelons of economic and social life independent of the right endorsed in those cases,” its brief states.Attorneys for Jackson Women's Health argued in a response brief that there have been no developments that have made the right to abortion “any less worthy of constitutional protection.” In particular, the idea that advancements in gender equality have made abortion any less vital is “nonsensical,” the clinic’s attorneys wrote, noting that the legalization of abortion has made it possible for women to participate equally in society.Individuals who are denied the right to an abortion face greater health risks associated with continued pregnancy and childbirth, lost educational opportunities, and economic insecurity, the attorneys said.“The right to abortion is really critical to women’s equality,” said Rikelman, one of the co-lead attorneys representing the clinic in Dobbs, said during a recent call with reporters.What are the possible outcomes?The Supreme Court could simply overturn Roe and Casey. However, legal experts think it’s more likely that the court will issue a narrow, yet still potentially devastating, ruling because of the political fallout explicitly getting rid of Roe would provoke.“It would be much more legally sophisticated and confusing for the general public if the court messes with the viability standard,” Aziza Ahmed, a professor of law at the University of California Irvine, told BuzzFeed News.And it does seem like the current court — with three justices nominated by then-president Donald Trump, who promised supporters he’d seek to overturn Roe — will try to rework the viability standard in some way that would allow at least some state laws significantly limiting abortion access to take effect. Ahmed said the court could create a new test to replace the viability standard or tinker with it in some way to allow Mississippi’s 15-week ban to take effect. It’s hard to say what that new test could be, but any ruling in favor of Mississippi would probably embolden other states to enact their own previability bans. Advertisement     “If the court is sort of dropping hints that it’s going to allow much more extensive limits, then states are going to test the waters and circuit courts are going to test the waters and that's going to mean fewer people with access in practical terms,” Mary Ziegler, a professor at Florida State University College of Law and expert on the legal history of abortion in the US, told BuzzFeed News.The other option, of course, is that the court could strike down Mississippi's law and find that “yes,” all previability bans are unconstitutional, reaffirming Roe. And while a ruling upholding the court’s precedents could preserve the institution’s legitimacy in the eyes of the public, experts said it doesn’t seem likely.“I just can't imagine them saying, ‘We’re going to affirm all parts of this,’ when they’ve been placed on the court for the purpose of doing exactly the opposite,” Melissa Murray, a professor of law at New York University School of Law, told BuzzFeed News. “But hey, I would love to be surprised.”When will the Supreme Court issue its ruling?The court typically releases all of its opinions on cases heard in a given term by the end of June, before it goes on recess. The court tends to deliver decisions that are unanimous sooner than those with concurring and dissenting opinions.Since the Dobbs case is being heard a couple of months into the court’s current term, it may not be until late May or June when the justices will issue their opinion on the case.

394,Virgil was the first Black man to be an artistic director for Louis Vuitton. He was also hugely influential in the music industry and received a Grammy nomination in 2011 for his work with Kanye West and Jay-Z.,"Celebrities across the fashion, arts, and sports industries have shared tributes to designer Virgil Abloh, who died from cancer at age 41 on Nov. 28. Virgil was perhaps best known for being the founder of Off-White. He later went on to become the first Black man to be an artistic director for Louis Vuitton, and the third to lead a French luxury fashion house. On Sunday, a post on his official Instagram account shared news of his death and revealed that the designer had been privately battling a rare and aggressive form of cancer, cardiac angiosarcoma, for two years. “We are devastated to announce the passing of our beloved Virgil Abloh, a fiercely devoted father, husband, son, brother, and friend,” the post read. “He chose to endure his battle privately since his diagnosis in 2019, undergoing numerous challenging treatments, all while helming several significant institutions that span fashion, art, and culture,” the statement continued. “Through it all, his work ethic, infinite curiosity, and optimism never wavered.” He is survived by his wife, Shannon Abloh, children Lowe Abloh and Grey Abloh, his sister Edwina Abloh, and parents Nee and Eunice Abloh. The LVMH group, the parent company of both Louis Vuitton and Off-White, said in a statement that Virgil was not only a “genius designer,” but also “a man with a beautiful soul and great wisdom.” Tributes have flooded in from Virgil’s colleagues in the fashion industry, including statements from luxury fashion houses like Gucci, Dior, Fendi, and Jacquemus. Kendall Jenner, a close friend and collaborator of the designer, led memorial posts from runway supermodels who have worked alongside Virgil throughout his career in fashion. “If you had the privilege of knowing Virgil, you were one of the lucky ones,” she began in an Instagram post featuring a string of photographs of them together. Kendall has walked in several of Virgil’s Off-White fashion shows, and the pair collaborated on the model’s 2018 Met Gala gown. “He had the most wonderful way of making you feel so special. His genuine smile would warm your heart,” she went on. “We have lost a dear friend. No words do my feelings justice at this very moment, but what I can say is that I am absolutely heart broken.” Following suit were supermodel sisters, Bella and Gigi Hadid, who, like Kendall, worked closely with Virgil throughout his career. “You broke boundaries and made everything your own. You shared your love infinitely. The way your brain worked was beyond anything,” Bella wrote of the designer beneath a carousel of photographs of the pair. “We’re gonna miss you a lot V.” Echoing her sister, Gigi described Virgil as “1 of 1” and said that she is “heartbroken by the loss of my dear friend, and a friend to the world.” Many of their fellow fashion industry peers, including Kaia Gerber, Ashley Graham, Emily Ratajkowski, and Derek Blasberg, also shared heartfelt posts commemorating Virgil on Instagram. However, one model who had a particularly special bond with the designer is Hailey Bieber. After the tragic news broke, Hailey shared never-before-seen photographs of her and Virgil during fittings for her Off-White bridal gown which she wore when she married Justin Bieber in 2018. “Virgil completely changed the way I looked at street style and fashion, the way he looked at things inspired me deeply,” she said on Instagram, before going on to express her gratitude for the time she and Virgil had shared. “I will never be able to fully express how grateful I am to have known him and worked with him, from walking on his runways to having him design my wedding dress and all the other amazing moments in between,” Hailey added. “I felt he was always rooting for me.” Meanwhile, her husband Justin Bieber shared a tribute of his own, writing on Instagram: “We lost a real one, rest in paradise king.” Alongside Justin, plenty of other musicians have spoken out on social media in memory of Virgil, who was as beloved in the music industry as he was in the fashion world. Virgil has been cited as an influence by some of the industry’s most prominent artists, including Drake, Offset, Future, Young Thug, and perhaps most famously, Kanye West. In a short Instagram post featuring a series of images of himself and Virgil, Drake wrote, “My plan is to touch the sky 1000 more times for you…love you eternally brother…thank you for everything.” Jaden Smith — who has also credited Virgil as one of his key inspirations — mourned the death of a “genius” on Instagram. Countless music industry greats like Pharrell Williams, Frank Ocean, and Questlove also penned tributes online. While other artists — including Rihanna, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, and Jack Harlow — reposted photographs on their Instagram stories. And aside from his accomplishments in fashion, Virgil was also nominated for a Grammy for Best Recording Package in 2011 for his cover art design for Jay-Z and Kanye West’s album, Watch the Throne. In fact, in the wake of his death, many fans were quick to turn their thoughts to Kanye, who was an especially close friend to Virgil. Kanye and Virgil, who are both from Chicago, began working together in 2002. They both interned at Fendi in 2009, and Kanye later named Virgil as the creative director of Donda — his creative agency — in 2010. The duo went on to collaborate on some of Kanye’s most iconic albums including, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Yeezus, and as previously mentioned, his Grammy-nominated project with Jay-Z. Virgil was even a groomsman at Kanye’s wedding to Kim Kardashian in 2014. In light of their decadeslong relationship, fans instantly expressed concern for how Kanye might be handling the news of Virgil’s death. Kanye is yet to issue a formal statement, but he did dedicate his most recent Sunday Service to Virgil in the wake of the tragic death. In yesterday’s livestreamed event, Kanye’s Sunday Service choir performed reworkings of Drake’s “God’s Plan” and Adele’s “Easy on Me.” At the end of the performance, text on the screen read: “In loving memory of Virgil Abloh, the creative director of Donda.” As a testament to his impact upon wider popular culture, several actors and sports stars also shared posts honoring the Off-White founder. Actors including Idris Elba, Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Timothée Chalamet spoke out on social media to mourn the loss of the designer, with the latter sharing screenshots of what appeared to be an old DM conversation between Virgil and himself. Elsewhere, LeBron James, Naomi Osaka, Lewis Hamilton, Megan Rapinoe, and Venus Williams led tributes from the sporting world — yet another industry where the fashion designer made his mark. Virgil branched into the world of sportswear with a highly innovative activewear collaboration between Off-White and Nike. Several of the exclusive custom looks were perhaps most famously worn on the tennis court by his longtime collaborator and friend Serena Williams. Serena has yet to comment on Virgil’s death, but her husband, Alexis Ohanian, wrote on Instagram that he was “gutted” to hear of the tragic loss."
395,"Preliminary evidence suggests there may be an increased risk of reinfection among people who previously had COVID-19 compared with other variants, the WHO said.","


Not much is known about the COVID-19 Omicron variant, and scientists around the world are still learning more about its potential impact, the World Health Organization said Sunday, noting that preliminary evidence suggested there may be an increased risk of reinfection among people who previously had COVID-19 compared with other variants of concern.But even then, the WHO said, “information is limited. More information on this will become available in the coming days and weeks.”It's not yet clear whether Omicron is more transmissible or whether it causes more severe disease than other variants do, the WHO said in the statement. “There is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with Omicron are different from those from other variants,” the organization added. Advertisement     The WHO also said that it was working with its partners to understand how current vaccines protect against Omicron.Getting vaccinated is still the best way to defend against COVID-19. “Vaccines remain critical to reducing severe disease and death, including against the dominant circulating virus, Delta. Current vaccines remain effective against severe disease and death,” the WHO said.What is clear is that Omicron has a relatively large number of mutations in its spike protein — the part that attaches the virus to healthy cells — which in part led the WHO to designate it a “variant of concern.” The WHO’s announcement, which came during the travel-heavy holiday season toward the end of the year, triggered travel restrictions around the world and brought fresh criticism that richer countries are hoarding vaccinations.The variant was first identified in South Africa, causing the US and several other countries, including the UK, Italy, France, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Morocco, Israel, and the Netherlands, to restrict travel from the region. Some public health experts said travel restrictions could discourage other nations from reporting future variants in an effort to avoid such constraints, and doubted that it would have much of an impact on the spread.PCR tests detect Omicron, the WHO said, but “studies are ongoing to determine whether there is any impact on other types of tests, including rapid antigen detection tests.” It’s unclear, the organization said, whether an increase in cases in South Africa was a specific result of Omicron or involved other factors.The Netherlands on Sunday confirmed at least 13 cases of people infected with the Omicron variant among 61 passengers who tested positive for the coronavirus after flying into the country from South Africa.Paul Burton, Moderna's chief medical officer, told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday that the company was working on developing a booster shot against the Omicron variant that could be available as soon as early 2022.""We should know about the ability of the current vaccine to provide protection in the next couple of weeks, but the remarkable thing about the mRNA vaccines, Moderna platform is that we can move very fast,"" Burton said on The Andrew Marr Show. Advertisement     ""If we have to make a brand-new vaccine, I think that’s going to be early 2022 before that’s really going to be available in large quantities.""Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told CNN’s State of the Union that the Omicron variant should ""redouble"" the nation's efforts to vaccinate people and give those who are eligible boosters.""The booster, it basically enlarges the capacity of your immune system to recognize all kinds of different spike proteins it's never seen,"" Collins said.And Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Meet the Press that the Omicron variant had about 32 or more variants in the spike protein of the virus and another 10 or more mutations on the receptor binding domain.These mutations could give the Omicron variant an advantage over methods of stopping new infections, such as vaccines or antibodies from a previous infection, Fauci said.""The profile of the mutations strongly suggest that it's going to have an advantage in transmissibility and that it might evade immune protection,"" Fauci said. ""It's not necessarily that that's going to happen, but it's a strong indication that we really need to be prepared for.""At a Saturday night press conference, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the health ministry would require — for anyone who enters the country or anyone who comes in contact with someone with a suspected positive Omicron infection — PCR tests and self-isolation. In addition, everyone will need to wear face coverings in shops and public transportation.The variant immediately raised questions about how, and whether, people should travel during the current holiday season.""People should continue with their plans as normal for Christmas. I think it's going to be a great Christmas,” Sajid Javid, the UK’s health minister, told Sky News.Scott Gottlieb, the former FDA commissioner, said on Face the Nation that it was ""almost a certainty"" that the Omicron variant was already in the US, considering how many planes have landed in the country over the Thanksgiving holiday. But Collins, of the NIH, said on State of the Union that there was no evidence the Omicron variant was already in the US.

396,"Deaths and devastating injuries. A litany of labor violations. Drivers forced to urinate in their vans. Here is how Amazon’s gigantic, decentralized, next-day delivery network brought chaos, exploitation, and danger to communities across America.","


Valdimar Gray was delivering packages for Amazon at the height of the pre-Christmas rush when his three-ton van barreled into an 84-year-old grandmother, crushing her diaphragm, shattering several ribs, and fracturing her skull.“Oh my god!” screamed Gray as he leaped out of his van. It was a bright, clear afternoon on Dec. 22, 2016, and the 29-year-old had been at the wheel of the white Nissan since early that morning, racing to drop Amazon packages on doorsteps throughout Chicago. He stood in anguish next to Telesfora Escamilla as she lay dying, her blood pooling on the pavement just three blocks from her home. After the police arrived, Gray submitted to drug and alcohol tests, which came up clean. He would later be charged with reckless homicide.
 


The officers who investigated the crash didn’t ask Gray about the constant pressure for speed he faced as a driver for Inpax Shipping Solutions — one of hundreds of small companies that make up Amazon’s gigantic delivery network across America. If they had, they would have discovered that the company’s drivers worked under relentless demands to deliver hundreds of packages each shift — for a flat rate of around $160 a day — at the direction of dispatchers who often compel them to skip meals, bathroom breaks, and any other form of rest, discouraging them from going home until the very last box is delivered.Amazon issued Inpax hand scanners that could monitor the progress of its drivers as they delivered their packages and dictated the routes they drove. It had sent Gray’s bosses at Inpax a memo just days before the accident, criticizing lackluster delivery rates in the area and instituting a “no package left behind” policy during the critical holiday week. The number of deliveries drivers were expected to make each day was way up, and dispatchers were urged to keep as many of their vans on the road for as long as possible — even if it meant driving long into the bitter winter night.But when Escamilla’s grieving family sought redress — suing Amazon, Inpax, and Gray for wrongful death — the e-commerce giant refused to accept any responsibility. “The damages, if any, were caused, in whole or in part, by third parties not under the direction or control of Amazon.com,” its lawyers said in a court filing.Inpax had by then been repeatedly cited by the Department of Labor for withholding pay from its drivers. Its owner had several cocaine-related felony convictions and had previously declared bankruptcy after missing insurance payments, failing to pay taxes, and defaulting on loans and other obligations amounting to $15 million. And the company was struggling to make ends meet on the razor-thin margins of a system set up by Amazon to squeeze contractors while minimizing its own costs at every turn.
 


Just months before Escamilla’s death, a former employee told BuzzFeed News, Inpax had stopped paying for a critical safety monitoring service it had installed in every van in Chicago — equipment some felt could have helped prevent the accident.But despite Inpax’s checkered record, after denying any blame for Escamilla’s death, Amazon continued using the company to deliver its packages across Chicago and at least four other major cities. Inpax did not respond to a detailed written request for comment.The super-pressurized, chaotic atmosphere leading up to that tragedy was hardly unique to Inpax, to Chicago, or to the holiday crunch. Amazon is the biggest retailer on the planet — with customers in 180 countries — and in its relentless bid to offer ever-faster delivery at ever-lower costs, it has built a national delivery system from the ground up. In under six years, Amazon has created a sprawling, decentralized network of thousands of vans operating in and around nearly every major metropolitan area in the country, dropping nearly 5 million packages on America’s doorsteps seven days a week.Amazon drivers say they often have to deliver upward of 250 packages a day — and sometimes far more than that — which works out to a dizzying pace of less than two minutes per package based on an eight-hour shift.
 


The system sheds costs and liability, even as it grows at lightning speed, by using stand-alone companies such as Inpax to pick up packages directly from Amazon facilities and deliver them to the consumer — covering what’s known in the industry as “the last mile.” Amazon goes further than gig economy companies such as Uber, which insist its drivers are independent contractors with no rights as employees. By contracting instead with third-party companies, which in turn employ drivers, Amazon divorces itself from the people delivering its packages.That means when things go wrong, as they often do under the intense pressure created by Amazon’s punishing targets — when workers are abused or underpaid, when overstretched delivery companies fall into bankruptcy, or when innocent people are killed or maimed by errant drivers — the system allows Amazon to wash its hands of any responsibility.Amazon still relies on UPS and the US Postal Service for many deliveries. And it has captured the public imagination with press releases about futuristic drone delivery, which does not yet exist. But it’s this homegrown network that makes it possible to offer the amazing convenience of next-day and even same-day delivery that has become a cornerstone of its market dominance. By some estimates, nearly half of Amazon's packages in the US are now delivered this way. And the Seattle-based giant dictates almost every aspect of that operation, down to what drivers wear, what vans they use, what routes they follow, and how many packages they must deliver each day.Amazon says its role is to lend entrepreneurs a hand as they build small businesses and not to control their companies, equipment, or labor force. It said it does not make personnel decisions for them, and while it offers them the opportunity to lease vans, purchase insurance, and manage payroll through its preferred programs, they are free to use whichever vendors they choose.
 


In response to a detailed list of questions from BuzzFeed News, it said that because many of the cases mentioned in this article are in active litigation, it cannot discuss them in detail. However, the company said safety is always its top priority and that even one serious incident is too many. It says that when accidents occur, it works with drivers or their employers to investigate claims and take appropriate actions.In a written statement about the article's findings, the company said:The assertions do not provide an accurate representation of Amazon’s commitment to safety and all the measures we take to ensure millions of packages are delivered to customers without incident. Whether it’s state-of-the art telemetrics and advanced safety technology in last-mile vans, driver safety training programs, or continuous improvements within our mapping and routing technology, we have invested tens of millions of dollars in safety mechanisms across our network, and regularly communicate safety best practices to drivers. We are committed to greater investments and management focus to continuously improve our safety performance.Six days after publication of this article, Amazon issued an additional statement: ""We require that all delivery service partners maintain comprehensive insurance, including auto liability so if in the rare case an accident does occur, there is coverage for all involved.""UPS and FedEx, the traditional powers of the logistics world, are deeply invested in safety. UPS, which spends $175 million a year on safety training alone, even has a policy prohibiting drivers from taking unnecessary left turns to reduce exposure to oncoming traffic, finish routes faster, and save fuel. Both firms are also heavily regulated by the government, and many of their trucks are subject to regular federal safety inspections and can be put out of service at any time by the Department of Transportation.But Amazon’s ingenious system has allowed it to avoid that kind of scrutiny. There is no public listing of which firms are part of its delivery network, and the ubiquitous cargo vans their drivers use are not subject to DOT oversight. But by interviewing drivers as well as reviewing job boards, classified listings, online forums, lawsuits, and media reports, BuzzFeed News identified at least 250 companies that appear to work or have worked as contracted delivery providers for Amazon. The company said it has enabled the creation of at least 200 new delivery firms in the past year, a third of which are owned and run by military veterans. Inpax gets fully 70% of its business from Amazon; some companies depend on the retail giant for all of their income.
 


A yearlong investigation — based on that data, along with internal documents, government records, thousands of court files, and interviews with dozens of current and former Amazon employees, delivery company operators, managers, and drivers — reveals that Amazon’s pivot to delivery has, all too often, exposed communities across the country to chaos, exploitative working conditions, and, in many cases, peril.Public records document hundreds of road wrecks involving vehicles delivering Amazon packages in the past five years, with Amazon itself named as a defendant in at least 100 lawsuits filed in the wake of accidents, including at least six fatalities and numerous serious injuries. This is almost certainly a vast undercount, as many accidents involving vehicles carrying Amazon packages are not reported in a way that can link them to the company. And in some states, including California, accident reports are not public.The deaths have included victims as old as Escamilla and as young as a 10-month-old baby named Gabrielle. Often with little training, and at times piloting vans in dangerous states of disrepair, Amazon drivers have crashed into cars, bicycles, houses, people, and pets. And under constant pressure to deliver ever more packages, drivers have piled parcels so high on their dashboards that they couldn’t see out the windshield — causing at least one serious collision.
 


In some of the cases in which Amazon was sued over road accidents, the drivers had been allowed to take the wheel despite previous convictions for traffic infractions.Delivering packages for Amazon can itself be a perilous job. Drivers have reportedly been punched, bitten, carjacked, robbed, and shot — and at least two have died in recent years as a result of road accidents that occurred on the job.Amazon denies any responsibility for the conditions in which drivers work, but it has continued to contract with at least a dozen companies that have been repeatedly sued or cited by regulators for alleged labor violations, including failing to pay overtime, denying workers breaks, discrimination, sexual harassment, and other forms of employee mistreatment.And when one group in Michigan voted to join the teamsters in protest against shoddy conditions and punishing hours without overtime pay, Amazon officials acted swiftly to counter further unionization efforts.In Southern California, Illinois, and Texas, Amazon continues to work with a firm beset by a staggering array of lawsuits from its own drivers, who said they weren’t paid properly, and from pedestrians, motorists, and cyclists, who said they were injured in collisions with the company’s trucks — even after its chief executive was accused by the firm’s own CFO of embezzling more than $1.5 million to fund an apparent gambling spree in Las Vegas.Two drivers for a different delivery company operating in the Los Angeles area said they were forced to skip meals, ordered to urinate in bottles rather than stop for bathroom breaks, and advised to speed and not wear seatbelts to ensure they delivered more packages in less time.
 


Amazon’s gargantuan delivery network was born after a notorious incident remembered in the corridors of the company’s Seattle headquarters as the “Christmas Fiasco” of 2013. As e-commerce began to boom and the holiday loomed, UPS and FedEx, which then delivered the bulk of Amazon’s packages along with the US Postal Service, were blindsided by the large volume of online orders and failed to deliver many parcels by Dec. 25.Furious, embarrassed, and determined that such an incident would never happen again, Amazon gave affected customers $20 gift cards while its executives hatched a bold and disruptive plan to free themselves from overdependence on the large, established carriers. They would develop a network of small and midsize delivery companies to take over key routes, working directly out of special Amazon delivery stations, rather than UPS or FedEx facilities, and delivering packages according to Amazon’s own routing algorithms.The goal, according to people with knowledge of Amazon’s operations — including a former executive who helped oversee the program in its early days — was to build out a completely independent last-mile delivery system. The company said it did so because of growing demand from customers, but continues to work with established delivery companies as well.
 


Amazon would offer small delivery companies, many of them brand-new, a chunk of its booming e-commerce business, and in exchange would be able to wield unprecedented leverage over their logistics operations. It would also have the power to squeeze costs down in a way it never could working with behemoths such as FedEx and UPS.Under this new system, Amazon would be able to closely monitor drivers through its routing software. It would make entrepreneurs assume the financial risk of running a delivery business. And perhaps most crucially, because the drivers would be employed by independent companies, Amazon would be able to assert it had no legal liability for their working conditions — or for any mayhem employees wrought as they raced to hit delivery targets requiring more than 99% of packages to arrive by their promised delivery date.In short order, fleets of anonymous-looking gray-and-white vans were dashing through the streets of communities across America, stopping every few blocks to disgorge books, electronic gadgets, boxes of toilet paper, and the myriad other items that people increasingly order online.
 


For consumers, the change was hardly perceptible — unless they happened to look out their windows and notice that the familiar brown of the UPS truck and the cheerful orange and purple of FedEx came less often, replaced by slightly smaller vans that often had no markings at all.But behind the wheel, and out on the streets, the changes were enormous.Even though the Sprinter-style vans Amazon requires its delivery providers to use weigh several times more than most passenger cars, they fall just under the weight limit that would subject them and their drivers to Department of Transportation oversight, unlike most FedEx and UPS trucks.In a sign of how business is booming, Amazon last summer bought 20,000 of these vans from Mercedes-Benz to be leased, through fleet managers, to its dedicated delivery companies around the country.
 


Applicants for jobs at UPS and FedEx are thoroughly screened and cram for challenging entrance exams before being hired. They undergo rigorous training that can last for weeks or longer, depending on the position, and are required to undergo additional training every year. Even the most minor fender benders trigger internal investigations that seek to identify who was at fault and how such accidents can be avoided in the future.UPS, which is unionized, uses routing software programmed to minimize most left-hand and other dangerous turns. As part of their training, its drivers must go through special protocols before making certain maneuvers, such as backing up their trucks.Amazon says it spends tens of millions of dollars on safety, and in some of its contracts with delivery companies, it demands that every driver pass a background check and drug test, have at least six months’ experience, and pass an extended road test. Job postings by firms delivering Amazon packages, however, say commercial driver's licenses and prior experience aren’t necessary. Drivers are paid either a flat day rate or an hourly wage — which generally works out to between $15 and $18 an hour, with scant perks or benefits. With constant alternation between driving and loading and unloading packages, the job is physically demanding.One of the first companies ushered in under Amazon’s new delivery regime was Progistics Distribution, an already operating San Francisco–based logistics firm that agreed to dedicate a portion of its fleet to Amazon packages. Jose Guillermo Perez was hired by the company as a driver in spring of 2014, soon after the Christmas Fiasco.
 


After two days of in-office training, Perez was sent onto the hilly, chaotic streets of San Francisco riding shotgun alongside a more experienced driver to learn the ropes. Things almost immediately went haywire. Just after lunch on the first day, Perez was astonished to find the driver backing into a light post, then speeding away from the scene as if the accident hadn’t happened, without even checking for damage. After that, Perez said in an interview, things got worse. The driver continued to ignore the speed limit and blew through stop signs as he shot up and down traffic-choked streets.“Dude, you need to be careful; I want to get back safe,” Perez recalled saying. “I don’t want to die, man.”But the driver, Jim Kitamura, told Perez he had to hurry.Shortly after 3 p.m., their Ford van approached a busy intersection in a residential neighborhood just as the light turned red. Rather than hit the brakes, Kitamura kept going, heading straight for a motorcycle that was accelerating through the crossing. A driver in another car noticed and honked frantically in warning, but the delivery van kept going and smashed into the bike, according to a police report.The impact was so powerful that it not only knocked Paul Hon Chow Lee off the motorcycle — fracturing his ankle, pelvis, and six ribs — but also knocked his shoes clean off his feet, according to the police report.Even before the crash, the events of the day had given Perez cause for alarm. He saw that drivers were given huge piles of packages to deliver and were barraged by constant nagging calls from dispatchers checking in on their progress. The vans, he thought, were in terrible shape, with worn tires and sagging suspensions, and he said he’d witnessed at least one driver smoking marijuana on the job. Perez said Progistics hadn’t done a drug test on him, and could not recall any other screening process.Progistics did not respond to a detailed request for comment.Police cited Kitamura for running a red light. It was far from his first driving violation. In the eight years leading up to the accident, Kitamura had been pulled over at least four times, records show, twice pleading guilty to driving more than 20 mph over the speed limit — once in 2006 and once in 2008 — and once to running a stop sign in 2011. He’d also been charged with sex crimes involving minors and was a registered sex offender.So concluded Perez’s training.The first day he was sent out on his own, he quit before the shift was over.“I thought, No, this is crazy. I had 160 packages and it was raining; you can’t even see,” he said. “I did, like, probably half of it and I took the truck back and went and told the guy, ‘This is it. I’m done.’”
 


In the five years since it dove into last-mile delivery, Amazon’s business has boomed.In 2018, its retail sales hit a record $233 billion, and this year it surpassed Walmart as the largest retailer in the world. In April, it promised free one-day shipping for all its Prime members — an unprecedented logistical challenge.Not all of Amazon’s packages are carried by its network of small providers; it continues to rely on UPS and the US Postal Service for many of its deliveries, particularly for bulky packages or for rural, harder-to-reach destinations. But with FedEx recently canceling its contract to deliver Amazon packages, a growing share of the huge delivery load is being carried by the network of tiny, lightly regulated firms in its vast national network.Delivering billions of packages a year is by far one of the company’s top expenditures. But Amazon can better control those costs by squeezing its own delivery network. It not only can track every package but also can monitor payroll, insurance, and even van leasing costs for many of its delivery companies. That allows it to keep an eye on companies’ profit margins and adjust accordingly. Early this year, for example, Amazon stopped paying delivery companies extra money to cover the cost of a dispatcher in each delivery station, requiring the companies to pay that salary out of already thin margins or operate without them.Amazon pays many of its delivery firms a flat fee per route, so when package volumes increase and drivers need to be out on the road for longer, racking up more overtime, their margins are squeezed even tighter. One contract for a route in San Francisco reviewed by BuzzFeed News, for example, called for a fee of $279.50 per day. That money must cover the cost of the van, insurance, and any other overhead, plus the driver’s wages. Some newer delivery firms are paid a per-route fee, plus a per-package fee.Many of them have no source of income other than Amazon and, faced with those circumstances, can find they have no choice but to cut back wherever they can.
 


Drivers complain of poorly maintained vans, with underinflated and balding tires, cracked or missing sideview mirrors, and, in one case, doors that had to be held shut with bungee cords. Frequently they have no backup cameras, and many don’t even have a rear window. As a result, some drivers back into things — lawns, mailboxes, parked cars, and, sometimes, people.And then there are the corners drivers themselves cut to finish their deliveries on time and keep dispatchers off their backs. Drivers complain they are sometimes given so many packages that they don't all fit in the cargo area and must be piled on the passenger seat. Some said they pile packages on the dashboard to save the time it takes to walk around to the rear of their vans for each delivery. Having the parcels laid out at their fingertips, they explained, helps them get through their routes more quickly and avoid the wrath of impatient dispatchers. But that convenience comes at a cost.Resty Evinger was pulling out of a parking space outside an apartment complex in Austin in March 2018 when she collided with Julia Barrera Duran. The 62-year-old was knocked to the ground, and her head hit the asphalt. According to claims in a pending lawsuit filed by Duran, Evinger had her left foot in a medical boot and walked with crutches. She quickly got out of the Dodge Ram van and knelt by Duran’s side. According to a police report, Evinger explained why she hadn’t seen Duran in broad daylight: Her view had been partially obstructed by a pile of Amazon packages arranged on the dashboard.Amazon said that it considers a variety of factors when considering the size of loads, but said it is up to drivers to determine how to pack the vans and where to put the packages. If a driver is worried about the number of packages they are given, they are welcome to raise those concerns.
 


Amazon can surveil almost every driver in its delivery network. But when it comes to the pedigree of the companies it entrusts to deliver its cargo, officials are remarkably hands-off, overlooking serious safety lapses, criminal convictions, and egregious violations of labor laws.Amazon said it expects its delivery operators to comply with the law.In July 2015, an obscure mining firm in Idaho abruptly changed ownership and announced it was getting into the package delivery business for Amazon, under the unlikely new name of Scoobeez.Just months after making its first deliveries, however, the company was sued by four drivers who successfully claimed they had been misclassified as contractors rather than employees. It would be the first in a string of employment, personal injury, contract, and workplace discrimination lawsuits filed against the firm.In March 2017, the company’s CFO sent a 25-page report to the Scoobeez board of directors alleging that CEO Shahan Ohanessian had misappropriated as much as $1.5 million of the company’s funds, transferring the money to his own bank accounts and withdrawing hundreds of thousand of dollars of that money at the Wynn hotel and casino in Las Vegas. Subsequent investigations concluded that Ohanessian then took out 17 high-interest loans to cover his tracks, costing the company some $2 million in fees and interest payments — money that might have been used to pay the drivers who were suing the company for unpaid overtime or, for example, the Texas family who came home one day to find that a Scoobeez van had rolled down their driveway and into their house, smashing the side of their attached garage.In April, Scoobeez filed for bankruptcy protection, listing, among other liabilities, monthly payments totaling nearly $7,000 for leased Bentley, Porsche, and Mercedes-Benz luxury vehicles that were made available to the company’s top executives.Scoobeez denied, in a separate court filing, the former CFO’s embezzlement allegations, saying they were fabricated and part of a ploy to take control of the company. Ashley McDow, an attorney representing Scoobeez in its ongoing bankruptcy, said the company had nothing to add beyond what is in the public record.As of late August, the company continues to recruit delivery drivers for locations throughout Southern California, Illinois, and Texas — and in court records, it has claimed that 99% of its revenue comes from Amazon. Newly filed personal injury lawsuits continue to roll in, and in May, Enterprise sued Scoobeez, claiming it owed it more than $700,000 for damages to vans it had leased the company.Ohanessian and his wife are no longer with Scoobeez and lately have turned to another possible get-rich scheme: putting logistics on the blockchain.In 2017, Courier Distribution Systems, another of Amazon’s larger delivery providers, was notified by Inc. magazine that it was one of the 500 fastest-growing privately held startups in the country. “Welcome,” the magazine’s editor-in-chief wrote in a congratulatory letter, “to the most exclusive club in business!”Like other Amazon delivery companies, CDS — based outside of Atlanta but delivering Amazon packages in several states, including Wisconsin, California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois — was required to carry a full slate of insurance.In addition to cargo, business, and general legal liability coverage, Amazon requires delivery firms to carry workers' compensation policies, which are designed to cover the costs of medical care for employees injured on the job as well as any lost wages.But that system failed Aleasa Thomas, who worked for CDS in the Milwaukee area. In April 2017, while completing a delivery to a house, Thomas said, she was violently attacked by a dog, causing her to fall and hit her head.Only later did Thomas discover that CDS — which had earned its place on the Inc. list by growing at least 10 times larger over the previous three years — had failed to pay its workers' compensation premiums in Wisconsin between February and June of 2017, meaning she was not covered. CDS was later hit with a $154,000 judgment for failing to pay workers' compensation insurance in the state.Jim Blanchard, a CDS representative, acknowledged the four-month insurance lapse but said it occurred while the firm was applying for different coverage. He added that CDS paid all of Thomas’s “medical bills, all of her unpaid wages, and any other losses.”Wisconsin was far from the only region where CDS appears to have fallen fell behind on its bills. The firm has faced at least two dozen lawsuits and other claims in recent years by employees who say it didn’t correctly pay them, fired them without cause, or discriminated against them. Some of those cases settled out of court. A tire company near San Diego won an $11,578 judgment against the company in November 2017 after CDS failed to pay its bills.Elsewhere, CDS had faced a mutiny from some of its drivers. Jovon Bray, a dispatcher at CDS in Sacramento, said he was forced to quell a near riot in October 2015 when roughly 100 angry drivers showed up to work demanding to know why they hadn’t been properly paid. When Bray called a manager at headquarters for advice, he recalled being told, “You need to find a better lie to tell them.”
 


When it happened again two months later, Bray said he called again and declared that he wouldn’t work unless everyone — including himself — got paid on time. A few days later, he recalled receiving a phone call from a supervisor while at a holiday party. “You aren’t management material,” Bray recalled the person telling him before summarily firing him. Bray and several other workers sued CDS and eventually settled out of court.“The whole thing is like a joke,” Bray told BuzzFeed News. “They had no rules established. I asked if there was a manual or a handbook, what are my expectations? They said, ‘You gotta create them as you go.’”Blanchard denied the allegations. “I assume this has been fabricated,” he said. He added that “CDS has offered good-paying jobs and benefits to thousands of employees — many of whom lacked the education or skills to secure any other job paying as much as they earned at CDS — and largely without incident or dispute.”In the wake of the uprising, CDS lost its Sacramento routes. But Amazon continues to work with the company in numerous other cities around the country.The same labor problems that appear across Amazon’s delivery network were apparent at Inpax in the period leading up to the crash that killed Telesfora Escamilla. Just months after Amazon began working with the firm in 2015, it fell under investigation by the Department of Labor for chronically underpaying dozens of drivers and was ordered to pay employees back wages. The following year, regulators found Inpax had “willfully violated” labor laws a second time by failing to pay drivers overtime. Third and fourth investigations would uncover more violations and unpaid wages of more than $140,000.
 


Inpax’s founder and CEO, Leonard Wright, had a string of cocaine-related felony convictions and first registered the company shortly after finishing a three-year prison sentence for narcotics distribution. Yet despite the mounting warnings that Inpax had serious issues, Amazon kept shoveling more business in its direction. By 2016, the firm was delivering in at least five cities — Atlanta, Cincinnati, Miami, Dallas, and Chicago — Labor Department records acquired through the Freedom of Information Act show.As Christmas of 2016 approached, Amazon was on track for what would be its biggest holiday season to date, ultimately shipping more than 1 billion packages worldwide. To handle the record-setting workload, it piled on the pressure, ramping up the number of packages each driver was expected to deliver each day.
 


By then, Inpax had eliminated numerous fleet managers whose job it had been to oversee safety and operations, according to former employees. The firm had stopped repairing vans that were damaged or had missing mirrors, cracked windows, or bald tires. And, two said, it stopped paying for a state-of-the-art fleet monitoring service it had installed in all of its vehicles that tracked their location and speed and was designed to alert fleet managers if drivers were making unsafe maneuvers.Escamilla’s death that December was not the first or last time the company’s drivers would run into trouble on the roads. Court records show the company has been served with at least five additional accident-related lawsuits since then.In October 2017, an Inpax van loaded with Amazon parcels came around a corner in Weston, Florida, and plowed into a cockapoo that had run into the road before the eyes of its owner and her two young sons. When the distraught woman banged on the window in outrage, the driver hit the gas, dragging her to the ground, according to a police report. Although the woman escaped with minor scrapes, the dog did not survive.
 


The driver told police that she called her manager at Inpax to report the accident and was instructed to leave immediately and return to the delivery station. Perez voluntarily returned with her Inpax manager later that day to speak with police, but she was ticketed for fleeing the scene of the accident and ordered to pay $1,500 in restitution, court records show.The dog's owner is suing Inpax and the driver for physical and emotional damages, claiming that Perez had been “speeding down the street.” Inpax countered that the incident was solely due to her own “carelessness and negligence” in letting her dog stray into the road. Amazon was not sued; once again it escaped liability.
 


Traivon Hemingway, a slender 21-year-old who delivered packages in and around Chicago for Amazon delivery provider Sheard-Loman Transport, was attempting to make an exit off an interstate southwest of town on the morning of June 19, 2018, when the Ford van he was driving struck the back of a tractor trailer parked on the highway shoulder.The force of the impact tore off the top of the van and drove the rest of the vehicle under the trailer. Emergency workers tried but failed to resuscitate Hemingway at the scene of the crash, where he died.News of Hemingway’s death spread quickly through the Amazon delivery station on the South Side of Chicago where he’d worked, but there is no record of his death being investigated by workplace health and safety officials. News reports about the accident never linked Hemingway’s death to his work for Amazon, but a GoFundMe page set up by his sister received a $100 donation from Bill Seliger, an Amazon executive who managed delivery-firm accounts in Chicago.Hemingway’s van was eventually returned to Sheard-Loman, which has been sued three times in the last year by former employees claiming they were cheated out of overtime and other wages. All three suits are pending.Sheard-Loman did not respond to a written request for comment.More than a year after his death, one of Hemingway's relatives in Chicago was still frequently posting about his death on Facebook. ""Not a day goes by that I don't think of him and still cry,"" she wrote on Aug. 30. ""Missing you so much Traivon Hemingway until we be together again.""
 


When delivery drivers complain about the harsh conditions they face, Amazon refuses to admit any responsibility. But when a group of drivers banded together to advocate for their rights to fair pay and safe conditions, executives at the e-commerce giant moved quickly to quash any further such efforts.In March 2017, a group of drivers for the delivery firm Silverstar Delivery met with a Teamsters organizer at a TGI Fridays outside of Detroit to complain about the shoddy condition of the vans they drove, Amazon GPS devices that conked out at crucial moments, and, in particular, a lack of overtime pay, despite shifts that routinely lasted as long as 12 hours.The organizer convinced them to unionize, and the following month, Silverstar employees voted 22–7 to join the Teamsters, making it the only Amazon delivery contractor to have unionized to date.Silverstar did not react positively to the news. Within weeks, drivers reported to the National Labor Relations Board that they were being fired for joining the union.One of the workers claimed he was terminated in May after bringing back undelivered packages to the warehouse. When he complained, the worker said a manager told him, “I was told to write you up for anything because you joined the union,” according to NLRB filings.The board dismissed the charges that workers were illegally fired in retaliation for unionizing, but allowed other claims of anti-union activity to proceed. Silverstar ultimately agreed to pay $15,696 to settle the matter.The Teamsters named Amazon in their complaint, but the retailer denied having any legal relationship to the unionized workers. “While Amazon has a services contract with Silverstar, Amazon is not the employer of Silverstar’s employees,” the company wrote in a letter to the NLRB.A few months later, Norm Collins, who had been elected shop steward, received a call from a Silverstar dispatcher who told him the company was shutting down its Michigan location immediately, putting dozens of drivers, as well as several dispatchers and managers, instantly out of work. “He said don’t report to work because Silverstar came down, packed up all their stuff, took the vans,” Collins recalled. “They’re gone.”Not long after the successful unionization vote, a team of Amazon officials paid a visit to Chicago, where they gathered top management from delivery firms operating in the city at a hotel west of town, according to two people who attended the meeting. The topic: how to ensure that what happened to Silverstar would never happen to them.“The whole purpose of the meeting was to say to you, ‘Here’s how to not get unionized. Because if you do, we pretty much don’t want anything to do with a union,’” said one attendee.In July, a Canadian news site reported that Amazon had held a similar meeting to discourage organizing among drivers for Toronto-area delivery companies.The closure of Silverstar hardly slowed down Amazon’s Detroit-area operations. Other delivery firms already operating in the area were happy to pick up the available routes.
 


Because of the low pay, long hours, and high stress of the job, turnover among Amazon delivery drivers is high.Former dispatchers said it’s not uncommon for drivers to quit in the middle of their shifts, sometimes abandoning the vans on the road. If a delivery firm doesn’t have enough drivers on any given day, it risks losing routes to competing delivery companies operating out of the same warehouse. Amazon routinely monitors and ranks the performance of each provider, delivery company managers say, and rewards its most reliable performers with additional and more profitable routes.As a result, delivery firms are constantly recruiting drivers to get on the road as fast as possible — and in an economy with national unemployment currently below 4%, former managers described a perpetual hiring crisis that requires them to accept nearly anyone who walks through the door.
 


A manager at Sheard-Loman, for example, recently used Facebook to cast a wide net for potential drivers.“I’m launching an AGGRESSIVE hiring campaign. If someone owes you money and they’re not working, if someone needs to move out yet using the excuse that they don’t have a job, if your baby’s daddy/momma is behind on child support, have them call me NOW,” he wrote. “I’m hiring on the SPOT.”But despite the high pressure and tight margins, many companies have jumped at the opportunity to get a piece of Amazon’s home delivery business. Some have had their dreams crushed.Two years ago, Thomas Chen, a Chinese immigrant living in Southern California, was delighted when Amazon invited him to join its last-mile delivery empire. Chen had spent several decades in the import-export business and had built a relationship with Amazon through his work bringing Chinese merchandise into the US for sale. In the summer of 2017, he said, he enrolled in a multiday training session that Amazon holds for new delivery firms and had his first five vans on the road in Portland, Oregon, starting Nov. 1.Rather than lease vehicles, Chen invested in a fleet of 36 brand-new vans, and his fledgling firm, FM Xpress, was soon awarded several routes in the Inland Empire outside of Los Angeles. In February 2018, he spent $2.5 million to acquire an already established delivery company called Metax Logistics.Business was good and growing fast, and so when an Amazon executive approached him in April 2018 about buying a third company a few months later, he leaped at the opportunity. The firm, NEA Delivery, had been one of the first delivery companies contracted by Amazon back in 2014 and had more than 200 vans in service, making deliveries up and down the West Coast.Chen said he sought and received what he called a “green light” from Amazon that NEA would be a good investment, and the $4.5 million purchase was closed in a matter of weeks. By October of that year, Chen said, he had 875 drivers on the road, a payroll of $1.6 million, and was delivering upward of 100,000 Amazon packages a day.But it turned out there was a lot about NEA that Chen hadn’t been told. The firm had been sued numerous times over employment issues and accidents involving its drivers. One such suit, filed against NEA and Amazon, involved a teenager who said he suffered a head injury in 2015 when his bicycle was struck by an NEA delivery driver opening his door into the bike lane.Even as Amazon approached Chen about the deal, it was arguing in court that it should be dropped from that lawsuit, claiming it bore no responsibility for the teen’s injuries. The case eventually settled.
 


Chen, who admits that he could have done more due diligence but said he trusted Amazon’s advice, had to contend not only with those cases but also with at least a half-dozen more suits that were filed against NEA after the deal closed and are still pending.Another problem, according to Chen, was that Amazon was often extremely late in paying its weekly invoices, which stretched his finances. He complained about it during a meeting with Amazon executives in a Santa Monica hotel early this year, he said, and soon thereafter noticed that his routes had been dramatically reduced. This April, he said, he received a call from a different Amazon executive telling him that his services were no longer needed and his contracts would all be terminated in 30 days.Chen’s three DSPs had recently been appraised at $28 million, he said, but Amazon offered him just $400,000 to sign a separation agreement and walk away. Instead, Chen filed a lawsuit, which is ongoing. In an interview, Chen claimed he believed that Amazon wanted to give away his routes to smaller, more pliant companies that would accept lower fees.Chen, who said he’s been thrown into a serious depression by the situation, grew emotional as he described having to fire hundreds of employees on the spot.“Amazon, you are so big,” he said. “Why do you want to treat your business partner this way?”Chen is not alone in complaining about not getting paid by Amazon.
 


Lisa Bythewood of Tampa, Florida, signed her first contract to provide delivery services to Amazon in March 2015, running routes out of Miami. In less than two months, Amazon assigned her two more locations. She was excited but also noticed that the company hadn’t yet paid any of her weekly invoices, she recalls. Figuring it was just a bureaucratic hang-up, Bythewood took out a large line of credit to keep her business afloat.By August, Amazon had awarded her company, VHU Express, an additional 17 locations, stretching from LA to Boston. But as the fall set in, she noticed that once again, Amazon was failing to pay her invoices and she started falling behind on her overhead. Bythewood took out a second line of credit, but it wasn’t enough and drivers started going unpaid.At least one of those drivers complained to the Department of Labor, which launched an investigation in early 2016. The regulator found that 120 employees were owed a total of nearly $190,000 in back wages and overtime — but determined that nearly all of that should be paid by Amazon rather than VHU, according to Labor Department records.It was a very unusual finding. Amazon has successfully argued, on multiple occasions in court and to regulators, that it had no responsibility for the treatment of drivers.The DOL investigator felt differently, noting that because Amazon controlled and supervised the work and working conditions, required VHU to operate out of its facilities, mandated what screenings employees should undergo and what clothing they should wear, and could “dictate who they no longer wanted working as” drivers, it was, in fact, a joint employer.Amazon acknowledged it had problems with its invoicing system, blaming a variety of factors, including having “moved their accounts payable department to India.” The company vigorously denied being a joint employer, but to get out from under the Labor Department’s thumb, it agreed to pay the workers. It also consented to pay back wages in Florida and Massachusetts, for a total of $352,816.71.But that didn’t put the matter to rest.Around the same time, Amazon terminated its contract with Bythewood, who had to lay off about 300 employees. Soon thereafter, it filed a claim against VHU in court, arguing that the firm had violated its contract, which required it to “defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Amazon from any third-party allegation or claim.” Eventually Amazon won a judgment against its former delivery company for nearly $300,000, despite the fact that it had apparently created the entire situation in the first place by failing to pay its invoices. Eventually Bythewood said she settled the dispute with Amazon out of court.In the meantime, Bythewood, a 51-year old mother of seven, was left facing lawsuits from unpaid lenders, insurers, van leasing companies, and workers. In a bid to help her, Bythewood’s mother emptied her own retirement fund, but it was to no avail: Bythewood and her husband filed for personal bankruptcy a few months later, listing more than $1 million in unpaid Amazon invoices in the filing.The previous summer, she had been named a finalist in the Tampa Bay Business Journal’s BusinessWoman of the Year awards because her company had landed a contract with Amazon. Now her company was gone.“You’ve got people chomping at the bit because all they think and see is dollar signs,” said Bythewood, who currently isn’t working. It was hard to say no, she said, because if “you don’t want to do it, someone else will.”Indeed, Amazon enjoys a glut of entrepreneurs eager for a chance at owning their own chunk of its delivery network. A Facebook group dedicated to people hoping to launch Amazon delivery companies has more than 500 members. They offer each other tips on how to pass the video interview (be sure to use Amazon’s STAR method for answering questions) and thoughts on whether or not $10,000 is actually enough to get started ($30,000 is a safer bet, some say).“Just got the call I’ve been hoping and praying for, I’m in!” a group member recently posted. “It was a long road, since applying June 2018. God is good.”
 


Shortly before 3 p.m. on April 19, 2018, a driver for a delivery firm called Last Mile Delivered, Keith Heard, turned left down a four-lane road in a Philadelphia suburb, following delivery directions on his Amazon device. Worried he was about to miss a second left onto a side street, he pulled into an intersection when he heard what he later described as a “thump” and assumed he had somehow hit a pole, according to the police report.What he had heard, in fact, was the sound of his Ford Transit van slamming into the body of Samuel Cabelus. The 22-year-old Temple University junior had been cruising on a motorcycle down the arterial at the time Heard cut in front of him, and when he tried to stop, his Yamaha hit the pavement and slid toward the van.Cabelus was crushed under the vehicle, where he died. Heard was cited by police for failing to yield before making a left turn. Cabelus’s grieving parents declined requests for interviews but blame Amazon for the accident, arguing that the company’s policy of pressuring drivers to meet guaranteed delivery times contributed to their son’s death, according to an ongoing lawsuit they filed against Amazon, Last Mile Delivered, and Heard in late 2018.In court, Amazon vigorously denied liability on the familiar argument that it does not control the delivery firms in its network or employ the drivers. And just as it had again and again — in cases of death, injury, and workplace mistreatment — the company invoked the carefully worded agreement it requires all delivery firms to sign, obliging them to defend and indemnify it from, or assume responsibility for, any and all legal claims. A lawyer representing Last Mile and Heard also denied responsibility for the death in court.In the year since her son’s death, Cabelus’s mother, Winnie, has written frequent Facebook posts about missing the young man she remembered in one comment as “stubborn, handsome, funny, a great big brother, invincible, charming, and absolutely adored.” In February, she posted an article about the crash in a public Facebook group called Bad Amazon Deliveries. “Please take these unprofessional driver mistakes seriously,” she wrote. “They may cost you life.“This is about shitty driving, yes,” she added. “But this is about low-paid, inexperienced, and untrained delivery drivers operating gigantic vans they don’t know how to drive, under enormous pressure to deliver quickly. This is profit driven, corporate greed behavior without consideration for anyone else’s humanity.”
 


Late on the morning of July 31, an attorney for Amazon walked into a dingy, cramped courtroom on the second floor of the Cook County Criminal Courthouse in Chicago. She was there to watch the trial of Valdimar Gray, facing a felony homicide charge in the death of Telesfora Escamilla.Moments before the trial began, 20 members of the Escamilla family entered the courtroom en masse, taking up half the seats in the gallery. Over two days of testimony, they relived the terrible afternoon of Dec. 22, 2016. On at least a half-dozen occasions, members of the family broke out into tears, sobbing audibly when the circumstances of Telesfora’s death were described.Gray, who had no previous driving infractions, sat stiffly in a gray blazer and a crisp white shirt. He faced a sentence of between 3 and 14 years in prison if convicted. The Escamillas had pushed hard for him to be prosecuted. The civil suit they had filed against Gray, Inpax, and Amazon couldn’t proceed until Gray’s criminal liability was determined.Escamilla’s daughter Irma told BuzzFeed News that she had heard about her mother’s death on her way home from work. She had been looking forward to spending Christmas Eve with her mom, a grandmother of 17, who had already purchased tamales for the family’s traditional Christmas Eve dinner.
 


Instead, she found herself staring at a pool of her mother’s blood on South Drake Avenue. “I still have a hole in my heart for my mom,” said Irma. “She’s not with us. I don’t know if I can overcome this.”Witnesses testifying for the prosecution described the accident and its aftermath, conceding under cross-examination that Gray might not have been breaking the speed limit, even if he was in a hurry, and had paused, albeit briefly, at a stop sign moments before impact.Gray’s lawyer, Adam Sheppard, saying the evidence was inconsistent and that Escamilla’s death was a “tragic accident,” called for his client to be acquitted. The judge concurred. Gray’s parents jumped for joy as the Escamilla family sat in shocked disbelief.But Gray showed little joy.“I’m not going to celebrate,” he said, walking grimly out of the courtroom with his mother and father.Letters of support filed in court by friends and family describe how the accident has changed Gray’s once-easygoing personality and how he’s haunted by memories of that afternoon.On that day, as dusk fell on the corner of West 28th and South Drake, amid crying members of the Escamilla family, gawking rubberneckers, and crowds of local TV news reporters, another Inpax employee quietly arrived on the scene to drive Gray’s Nissan van and the Amazon packages it held back to the Amazon delivery station, just 2 miles away.Gray was fired the next morning and soon had criminal charges hanging over him. The Escamilla family lost its matriarch. But those boxes and envelopes were absolutely going to get delivered by Christmas.The urgent memo Amazon sent to Gray’s supervisors at Inpax just five days before the fatal accident described the week as the “home stretch/final sprint” and urged that every driver be made “aware of the expectations for this week.”“Our #1 priority,” it said, “is getting every package to the customer on time.”Nowhere did it mention safety. ●

397,"“This project that we undertook together has a life beyond our interaction. Potentially, it has a lifelong impact.”","


Photographer Gregg Segal is an expert at visualizing our personal impact on the world around us. In his 2014 series 7 Days of Garbage, Segal illustrates the enormous amount of garbage that most people will toss in a single week by photographing his subjects literally posed in a week's worth of trash. For his new book, Daily Bread, Segal shifts his focus from the things we waste to the things we consume by visualizing what an entire week's diet looks like for children around the globe. Advertisement  To ensure that the project accurately captured what kids are really eating in the 21st century, Segal enlisted the help of children from all sorts of cultural and economic backgrounds, asking each of them to keep a journal of what they eat every day. At the end of the week, Segal had a team of chefs prepare the dishes for a portrait session with each kid. The results bring a striking perspective on the differences and similarities between diets across borders and classes.Here, Gregg Segal shares a selection of portraits from Daily Bread and discusses what he observed while researching how children eat.
 


Where did the idea for Daily Bread begin?Gregg Segal: Daily Bread grew out of 7 Days of Garbage. I began to ask, how have our diets been impacted by this revolution in the way food is produced and consumed? I thought, what if we keep a journal of everything we eat and drink for one week to bring our focus onto diet and take ownership of the foods we eat? I focused on kids because eating habits start young — and if you don’t get it right when you’re 9 or 10, it’s going to be a lot harder when you’re older!What goes into making each of these pictures?GS: For the overseas shoots, I needed a producer in each country to find the kids. The goal was to represent a diversity of diets in each location. If the rate of obesity in a given country was 25%, I aimed to reflect this percentage in my small sample of kids.Each kid kept a journal of everything they ate for one week. At the end of the week, producers collected the journals, checked to make sure they were complete, and then handed them off to the cooks, who would shop for all the ingredients and reproduce all of the meals. I photographed as many as five kids a day, so the cooks were responsible for preparing over 100 meals. These were often 14-hour days for the food preppers. It was demanding and exhausting! Advertisement  
 


Once all the food was prepped and plated, I’d arrange the dishes and other elements in the frame. Sometimes I’d have the luxury of a food stylist to collaborate with, though often it was just me doing the styling. Advertisement  Can you speak to the major differences in the diets of US children versus those of children in elsewhere?GS: It’s the similarities, not the differences, that are noteworthy. The children I met have distinct personalities and diverse hobbies, yet they’re often eating in eerily similar ways.Compare the diets of Paulo from Sicily and Isaiah from Los Angeles. In the past, a Sicilian boy would have grown up eating very different foods from his counterpart in the US, but now their diets are converging. Both Paulo and Isaiah eat french fries, burgers, pizza, pasta, and white bread. They live continents apart, but it’s as if the boys’ parents have been shopping at the same global superstore!
 


How much has globalization affected the diets of children around the world?GS: Enormously. I think we’re at a tipping point. The balance of what most children eat now is dramatically tipping away from homemade stews and vegetables towards ultra-processed, packaged foods and snack foods, many of them designed to appeal to children.For instance, Milo chocolate milk, which is drunk by kids from Hamburg to Sao Paulo and Mumbai to Dubai. The same story is playing out all over the world, often with the same branded foods marketed by the same multinational corporations.Was there anything entirely unexpected you learned from researching these diets?GS: One of the most surprising lessons of Daily Bread: The best-quality diets are often eaten not by the richest, but those living in poverty.In the US, people from low-income are the biggest consumers of junk food because it’s convenient and cheap. But in Mumbai, it costs $13 for a medium Domino’s pizza, which is way beyond the means of most people — like 10-year-old Anchal, who lives with her family in an 8-by-8-foot aluminum hut. Her father earns less than $5 a day and her diet includes no fresh fruit, yet she eats a wholesome and traditional diet of okra curries, lentils, and roti, which Anchal’s mother cooks from scratch each day on a single kerosene burner. Advertisement  Shraman, 12, lives in a middle-class Mumbai high-rise and eats very differently. His family’s extra income means he can afford Domino’s pizza, fried chicken, and treats like Snickers bars and Cadbury chocolate.
 


What do you hope people will take away from these images?GS: For me, photography is collaboration. It’s a process that invites reflection from both the subject of the pictures as well as the viewers.While I was photographing Adveeta, this 10-year-old in an elegant yellow dress, her father watched as the pictures came up on my laptop. He shook his head and said, “I can’t believe Adveeta is eating all that junk! I’m going to have to talk with her mother!”I remember a single mom in Los Angeles who looked at all the junk food in her daughter’s diet and blamed her ex-husband. “Except for that bowl of broccoli! That was the night she was home with me!” Parents are blaming each other all over the world because of this project — which tells me that it’s helping to move the needle on diet. This project that we undertook together has a life beyond our interaction. Potentially, it has a lifelong impact.
 


The collaboration extends to viewers too. I encourage kids who look at these pictures to ask a few simple questions about their own diets:1. How many of the foods you eat come straight from the garden, and how many are processed and packaged? Try to replace some of the processed foods in your diet with whole foods.2. How many ingredients are in the packaged foods? Are there more than five? Avoid foods with more than five ingredients. Especially avoid ingredients you can’t pronounce! Advertisement  3. How many of the foods you eat are featured in a TV commercial? Avoid foods that have a commercial.4. How many colors are in the foods you eat? If your diet is all white, yellow, and brown, you’re not getting enough vitamins and nutrients. It’s that simple!5. Is there anything green in your diet?

399,"The bestselling author’s new nonfiction collection These Precious Days is, among other things, an ode to unconventional friendships.","


Some writers write to understand themselves; others write to understand people around them. Ann Patchett belongs to the latter camp. The four-time New York Times–bestselling novelist — whose work has been adapted to films, plays, and even an opera — is fascinated by human relationships. “How other people live is pretty much all I think about,” Patchett writes in her newest book, an essay collection called These Precious Days, which is out today.Patchett, 57, belongs to a rare breed of authors who have successfully traversed the tricky divide between popular and literary fiction — you can read her work at the airport as well as in the pages of the New Yorker. Best known for her novels, she has recently turned more attention to essay writing. These Precious Days is her most intimate work yet, demonstrating her mastery in depicting connections between people.Patchett is a grande dame in the literary community — she hosts author events, mentors young writers, collaborates with other authors, and even co-owns Parnassus Books in Nashville. I met her early one October morning at this bookstore, which she opened with publishing veteran Karen Hayes back in 2010. Patchett takes all her interviewers here. Wedged between a Sherwin Williams and Fleet Feet in a strip mall in the posh Green Hills suburb of Nashville, the shop might have been easy to miss. But inside the store, not yet open to the public for the day, was a cozy book lover's paradise, filled with comfy chairs and carpets and dim lights dangling from the ceiling. Advertisement  Settling into a black leather chair across from me, Patchett put me at ease, gracefully sliding both legs over the armrest as her 15-pound rescue dog, Sparky, hopped up and nestled into her lap. At one point during our conversation, when I struggled to remember my next question, she gently reassured me: “This is normal, you’re only human.”At the heart of her new collection is a 66-page story about her transformational late-in-life friendship with Sooki Raphael, an artist and the longtime assistant to actor Tom Hanks. This title essay highlights Patchett’s unique aptitude for creating and nurturing friendships — her friendship with Lucy Grealy was the subject of her book Truth and Beauty — and how she deftly weaves these connections into riveting narratives.
 


Patchett’s writing, in line with her demeanor, demonstrates a wholesomeness almost unique among popular writers these days. It’s not political, edgy, or cool. Her cheery yet reflective outlook doesn’t subscribe to the self-consciousness that many younger authors seem inclined toward today. Her characters wouldn’t be called “mean-spirited,” for instance, as Ottessa Moshfegh’s protagonists have been. (The latter author once told the Guardian that she often feels similarly to her characters, and that it may be better to be “detached.”) Her work doesn’t exhibit the same inventiveness that Carmen Maria Machado has been credited for. And she doesn’t perform the same cultural probing as Jia Tolentino does in her essays.In contrast, Patchett is a better fit in the club of “feel-good” essayists, an older generation including writers like Anne Lamott or Calvin Trillin or the late Nora Ephron, whose stories are accessible and uplifting. (Yet even Lamott started her latest collection reflecting on climate change.) It’s this very vulnerability — her warmth, sincerity, and lack of pretension — that makes her a trustworthy guide. She’s a narrator who takes her readers by the hand, leading them through life’s ordinary events and spinning these events into something magical. Unlike many essayists today, Patchett does not fixate on polarization, the climate crisis, or global instability. Or, perhaps, she approaches these pressing issues from the other side. Through her eyes, the global pandemic offers a glimpse into our humanity. It is an opportunity for a new connection. It offers someone a new lease on life.
 


Born in Los Angeles to a police officer and a nurse, Patchett relocated to Nashville with her mother and sister when she was 6, following her parents’ divorce. She knew from childhood that she wanted to be a writer, and as a diligent literature student at Sarah Lawrence College, she published her first story in the Paris Review in 1984. In 1985, at the age of 22, she enrolled in the venerated Iowa Writers’ Workshop, which she told me was a “poker game; some years, the teachers are unbelievably brilliant. Other years, they’re a little flat.” Patchett spent years writing articles and short stories for publications from Seventeen to Bridal Guide. For many of those years, she also waited tables at the TGI Friday’s restaurant on Elliston Place in Nashville. In 1992, at the age of 27, Patchett published her first book, The Patron Saint of Liars, officially launching her career as a novelist.But it was 2001’s Bel Canto — a novel about terrorists coming to a party and taking the opera singer and audience members hostage, which was based on a true story and later became a feature film starring Julianne Moore — that earned her widespread acclaim. After the initial publication of 30,000 copies, the book became a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist and winner of the PEN/Faulkner Award, and in just two years had reached a circulation of 700,000. She became, as she describes in These Precious Days, “rich.” “I had so much money I no longer knew exactly down to the last dollar how much I had,” Patchett writes. She went on to publish 2011’s State of Wonder, 2016’s Commonwealth, and her most recent novel, The Dutch House, a Pulitzer finalist.Patchett’s work often contains elements of magical realism, fantasy, and mystery. Her stories are told from different perspectives and present a range of different plots, but many center on a set of complex characters and relationships — whether they are family members or a group of partygoers — that she writes deftly. It was a bit later into her career that Patchett began swiveling her (fictional) lens toward herself. She released her first essay collection, This is the Story of a Happy Marriage, in 2013. A couple of years later, Patchett wrote Commonwealth, a story about a blended family in California in the ’60s, at the age of 52 ‚ it was her “first autobiographical novel.” As she once told the Guardian, “I’ve been writing the same book my whole life — that you’re in one family, and all of a sudden, you’re in another family and it’s not your choice and you can’t get out.” Advertisement  
 


Patchett has found essay writing — especially during the pandemic — far simpler than writing fiction, and noted that it offers quicker rewards. Her essays, which have appeared in outlets from the New York Times to the New Yorker to the Wall Street Journal, have come almost naturally: “Facts have a way of popping up, their buoyant truth shining all the more brightly with time,” she writes in the introduction to These Precious Days. “I decided to go all in.” They are widely accessible, universal, and personal — captivating due to their insight, rather than shock value. In contrast to other mainstream essays today, they can feel a bit Pollyannaish, a little vanilla, but Patchett as a narrator comes across as refreshingly young at heart and kind — the kind of person you’d want to sit down with and share your life story with (as many have done).Her approach to writing fiction and nonfiction is the same: She does not follow the advice of some other writers — keeping a journal, sticking to a concrete schedule — but instead waits until an idea strikes.“It takes me a long time to come up with ideas,” Patchett told me. She’s just starting a novel now, for instance, and has been “thinking about it for three years. I could have started it three years ago or two years ago or six months ago, but I would have thrown it out.”She does all of her brainstorming without taking notes. “Part of it is forgetting. If it's good, I figure I'll remember,” she told me. “And if it's not, something else will come by.” After she has put pen to paper, no matter how much the story evolves, Patchett sticks with it. “Once I write, I get very attached to it; I try to make it work,” she explained. “So I let things change and change and change.”
 


These Precious Days touches on topics ranging from being raised by “three fathers” to not wanting children to a story about how author Kate DiCamillo turned her on to children’s literature.Patchett's story about her friendship with Sooki Raphael is the ultimate reward in the collection. The pair met at a 2017 book event that Hanks invited Patchett to moderate, during which Patchett noticed Raphael’s gorgeous coat. Her “eye kept going to her, the way one’s eye goes to the flash of iridescence on a hummingbird’s throat,” she writes in These Precious Days.The meeting led to Patchett asking Hanks on a “lark of the highest order” if he would narrate the audio version of her novel The Dutch House — the ensuing conversation between her and his assistant, Raphael, kicked off an “affectionate exchange” via email, and ultimately a long-distance friendship.Patchett learned that Raphael was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and she was “struck by an overwhelming sense of wishing I knew her, of not wanting to miss Sooki while she was here.” Advertisement  She turned this wish into reality. Patchett invited her new friend to come to Nashville for treatment — and to move in with her and her husband, Karl. Little did the trio realize that they would soon be riding out a global pandemic together — cooking meals, practicing kundalini yoga, and walking Patchett’s dog.About a month into the experience, Patchett knew she would write about it. “I needed to write it to process it, I needed to just get it down,” she said. Raphael was resistant at first, but, using her trademark charm, Patchett persuaded her. She would write the piece and then share it with Raphael. It would be “between the two of [them],” Patchett said, and they would decide together what to do with it.The result is a uniquely heartwarming tale of an unconventional friendship, offering a window into Patchett’s way of existing in the world — open, welcoming, and engaged.Patchett’s essay was first published in Harper’s in January 2021 with Raphael’s blessing. Raphael died from pancreatic cancer a few months later, in April 2021 — the epilogue in These Precious Days tells the story of Patchett’s final days with her friend. Patchett believes that her essay was “the biggest gift she could give” —even more than offering her home during COVID-19 — because she believes it ultimately helped Sooki “feel seen and understood” as the wonderful person all those knew her to be.
 


When Patchett left Nashville at the age of 17, she “didn't ever want to come back,” she told me. Returning for a visit when she was 30 — after Patron Saint of Liars, before Bel Canto — she ended up out on a couple of dates with a man named Karl, and started renting an apartment by the month. “I said to myself, ‘this is nice, but this is not what I’m doing with my life,’” she recalled. “I’ll go on when I break up with this guy.”She never broke up with him.Opening Parnassus cemented her place in Nashville, and Patchett believes her role as a bookstore owner, joining the ranks of other writers like Louise Erdrich, Emma Straub, and Jeff Kinney, is more culturally significant than her role as an author.“As a bookstore owner, I’m bringing people every book they want; as a writer, I’m bringing them my book,” she explained. “It’s the difference between bringing one voice and bringing many voices and lots of choices,” respectively.In this role, Patchett has also gotten an insider's glimpse into the publishing industry. Success is not about where you went to school, she said — going to Iowa, for instance, didn’t matter that much, in that regard — but she believes that “great always wins.” If the writing is great, she said, “there will always be a market for it.” Beyond producing great writing, Patchett’s been heavily involved in every step of the publishing process. Advertisement  Jonathan Burnham, the president and publisher at Harper Division who began working with Patchett in 2011, remarked on her unique engagement — in everything from writing to reading to editing to promoting. She is a “dream author” who “takes it upon herself to really understand each aspect of what's going on. I've never seen that with other authors,” Burnham said.
 


Patchett has a knack for making, and maintaining, friendships with other writers. And this cannot simply be attributed to her role inviting authors to speak at Parnassus, from which several friendships have emerged. One of her longest and deepest writing friendships is with author Elizabeth McCracken, whom Patchett met at the Provincetown Writers Colony in 1990. In 2020, the pair had planned to return there for their “30th anniversary of knowing each other.”From the start, McCracken took note of Patchett’s dedication to her craft. “I knew I couldn't be friends with her unless I worked hard,” McCracken said, and pretty quickly, the two began exchanging work. Advertisement  
 


McCracken was the first to read Patchett’s first book, Patron Saint of Liars, on her twin bed at the residency. For many years, she would be her first reader — although now McCracken says that she is part of a “pipeline” of authors that Patchett leans on for editing guidance. The collaboration has helped McCracken, too. “If I write, I want to write something that she will admire. That itself improves my work.”Barbara Kingsolver, another in Patchett’s pipeline, first knew Patchett by reputation before she “became her fast friend, as so many do.” Kingsolver spoke of Patchett’s uncanny ability to find the right book for every reader. “She's the friend that gives me the book that is exactly the book I need,” she said.(At the end of our interview, I followed suit, asking Patchett for a book recommendation. She landed on a book that was at her house, a galley she would give to me. “Just follow my car,” she said. McCracken later informed me, “that doesn’t make you special; Ann takes everybody home.”)Patchett’s goodwill toward the literary community is unusual, Kingsolver said. She’s “one of the truly most generous souls I've ever met,” wanting the best for all writers and readers, she continued. It’s unique in the literary world, which Kingsolver calls “notoriously ungenerous.”“If you're doing well as a writer, you're at risk of being despised by other writers and being taken down by any reviewer,” she said.A recent friendship has developed between Patchett and Lily King, author of Writers and Lovers. They met at the Southern Festival of Books“I saw her in the museum in rubber rain boots, and she kind of reminded me of Christopher Robin, in that magical and lovely way,” King said. “She was so kind and so warm, immediately.”In March 2020, at the start of COVID, they held a Zoom event together, which King describes as “the most magical experience. We started talking and forgot about the audience. It was like we were in person, with no one else around.” Since then, “a COVID friendship has blossomed,” King said. “It's been really one of the very best things about COVID for me.”On top of these long-distance friendships — which include Maile Meloy and Kate DiCamillo and Patrick Ryan — Patchett has a handful of writer friends in Nashville and nearby. She swaps work with local Nashville authors Mary Laura Philpott, Margaret Renkl, Kevin Wilson. “We also talk about the books we're reading and the movies we're seeing and what we made for dinner — and we send each other funny pictures of our dogs,” she said.
 


Patchett’s ultimate goal seems to be a life well-lived, in service of those other important lives around her. For instance, she didn’t just encourage McCracken in her writing; she pushed her friend to learn how to operate a vehicle.“Ann made me learn how to drive,” McCracken recalled. “I really didn’t want to; she was forceful.”I asked Kingsolver — who was born in Kentucky — if Patchett’s warmth might be partially attributed to her Southern upbringing. She agreed that Southern women are often “well-schooled in kindness and hospitality and reading other people's needs.”But “not everybody lives it the way Ann does,” Kingsolver stressed.After our interview at Parnassus, I followed Patchett home so that she could give me an advanced reader’s copy, which she said was suited exactly for me. Later, sitting across from Patchett in her living room, drinking a seltzer, I sensed that I had become initiated into some kind of club — that others before me must have had this same feeling being in the company of Ann Patchett.I mentioned something about how she welcomes people into her home. Other interviewers, she responded, have been nearly confused by her brand of hospitality.“That’s the dirt on me,” she said with a laugh. “I’m nice.” ●

400,Some sellers offer gift cards or freebies to customers in exchange for five-star reviews. Amazon is recommending their products as “Amazon’s Choice.”,"


“Amazon’s Choice” is a label designed to convince customers to buy what Amazon says are “highly-rated, well-priced products.” Products with the designation see a threefold increase in sales, according to a 2018 study.But many Amazon’s Choice products sold by third-party sellers are not what they seem. Some listings have inflated ratings and feature glowing reviews written by customers who were promised gift cards or free products by sellers in exchange for five-star ratings. Advertisement     Sean, a longtime Amazon Prime member who asked to be identified by his first name only, recently bought a $19 waterproof case on Amazon for his new Samsung Galaxy phone. The case had over 100 positive reviews by verified purchasers, and an Amazon’s Choice designation, which, Sean said, is what led him purchase to it. The product turned out to be terrible. The buttons were difficult to press, and the built-in screen protector was so reflective that it rendered the phone unusable in daylight.
 


He immediately knew why the crappy case had such great reviews. Tucked into the product’s packaging were instructions on how to redeem a $19 gift card (it does not specify the type of gift card). Proof of a five-star review of the case was required. Advertisement     
 


“It’s really telling that the offer was for the entire amount of the item,” Sean told BuzzFeed News.The case's seller did not return BuzzFeed News’ request for comment.He plans on returning the product and hopes Amazon will more closely scrutinize its recommendations for items sold by third-party sellers: “Amazon is not checking up on Amazon’s Choice nearly enough. [This case] is not a quirky, out-of-the-way item. It’s a primary accessory for one of the most popular phones on the market.” Advertisement     In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that incentivized reviews are against the site's policy, and that sellers who violate its rules are suspended or banned, adding, “When a product we identify as Amazon’s Choice does not continue to meet our high bar, we immediately remove the badge.” The spokesperson didn’t say whether the company would take action against the seller of Sean’s phone case.The policy hasn’t stopped third-party sellers, many of whom are adept at dodging the company’s moderators. Even listings in which reviews explicitly mention free products, which is also against Amazon’s rules, often evade detection.In August, an Amazon customer named Anna ordered a probiotic supplement labeled Amazon’s Choice. When the product arrived, she saw a “free refill” sticker on top of the bottle. Anna told BuzzFeed News that, after trying to obtain the refill, the seller requested evidence that she had left a positive review.Multiple reviews on the listing mention the refill deal specifically. Mark M. wrote, “Be aware, the good reviews are bought. My wife wrote a good review and did not get her free bottle. By the look of the reviews here, many did.”
 


A different probiotics supplement, labeled Amazon’s Choice, also has reviews mentioning free products received in exchange. An Amazon’s Choice supplement promising anxiety relief features similar reviews. The seller of an Amazon’s Choice rosehip oil moisturizer also gave away free bottles for positive reviews.Has an Amazon seller offered you an incentive to leave a five-star review? Contact this reporter with information or tips via email at nicole.nguyen@buzzfeed.com.Incentivized ratings aren’t new. Third-party sellers have been compensating people for positive reviews for years. The distinction, however, is that listings featuring inauthentic reviews can be marketed as Amazon’s Choice, and customers, who take the label as a signifier of quality, end up with shoddy products recommended by Amazon. The label implies a human-curated selection of products reviewed and tested by the company, but the selection is actually determined by an algorithm. Advertisement     In June, BuzzFeed News reported that Amazon was recommending items with troubling defects and had reviews that were recycled from unrelated products. Following the story, Democratic Sens. Bob Menendez and Richard Blumenthal raised concerns over Amazon’s Choice products in a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.Brian Huseman, Amazon’s vice president of public policy, answered the senators’ query, which is embedded in full below. Huseman said Amazon employees “do not manually review” Amazon’s Choice products, which are chosen by an algorithm that considers multiple factors, including inventory, pricing, and return rates, in addition to reviews. Ratings do play a key role. In most categories, he said, products must have a four-star or above average to qualify for the label. According to Huseman, more than 2 million products are automatically awarded the badge every month.Huseman added that abuse of reviews is “an industry-wide problem”; in September, he claimed that “over 99%” of reviews on the site were authentic.Menendez did not find Amazon’s explanations satisfactory. In a statement following Huseman’s response, he wrote: “The response fails to provide evidence or assurance that it’s ‘choice’ recommendations meet quality and safety standards. I am left with more questions than answers and have less confidence that Amazon Choice is helping shoppers choose the best quality products available.”Regarding reports of bribery by Amazon sellers, Menendez wasn't surprised. “Here we go again, with yet another example of Amazon’s failure to actually enforce its own rules and policies,"" the senator told BuzzFeed News. ""Not only is Amazon misleading customers who rightly expect that the “Amazon's Choice” moniker means a product is of the highest quality, this report indicates consumers should also question whether those accompanying five-star reviews are real, or simply in exchange for a freebie.”

403,"For influencers to attract sponsorship opportunities, the photos on their feeds need to look polished.","


This is a special edition of Please Like Me! We’re running this newsletter alongside JPG, our newsletter about powerful photography that enthralls the internet. You can sign up for Please Like Me here, and JPG here.
 


For influencers to attract sponsorship opportunities, the photos on their feeds need to look polished. That extra glisten comes from hiring professionals — which in turn has changed the photography industry.This week I spoke to Julia D’Agostino, a 25-year-old photographer based in Stamford, Connecticut, who works mainly with lifestyle and fashion influencers. “My first ever postcollege client was actually an influencer — I jumped right into the world,” she told me. She now has a growing Instagram account to feature photos she takes of social media creators (such as Eva Amurri of @thehappilyeva, a lifestyle blogger and Instagram influencer with over 189,000 followers), and also to modestly start building her own personal brand online, which is a fascinating new layer to all of this.Julia said lifestyle shoots have changed subtly, but in very revealing ways, over the last few years. In, say, 2015, a standard fashion shoot with an influencer client would be fairly formulaic. “We were primarily styling outfits and photographing them in a cool location,” she told me. “I would photograph the shoes up close, grab a detail of a bag, a nice shot of the headband, make sure to grab a full-body image as well.”Today, because her clients are open to all kinds of spon, things are more complicated. Her job is a meticulous game of making sure the necessary products are featured, but that she, and the influencer, are then not intentionally pushing other products in a photo. Advertisement     Often Julia is working to highlight multiple items — say, a soap, a blanket, or a battery — while shooting at a specific location and keeping the background clear of any other brands. The whole time they’re trying to ensure that it “still reads as a lifestyle image without coming across as a true #ad,” she said.Because influencers and photographers are often self-employed, their unique business relationship is usually one that has to be mutually beneficial.“Most of the time when both sides of the stick are new to the game, there’s always a trade in mind to help each other out, which I love,” she added. “I think it’s great for everyone to learn from one another.”The work also fosters an intimacy that she’s really grown to appreciate, especially over the last two years. “When I’m photographing with influencers, especially through COVID, I am invited into so many different homes and families,” Julia said. “I know their husbands, their children, even their own parents. It’s a very personal world. Sometimes we take a 15-min therapy sesh while changing outfits in the car — we style together, we brainstorm together, we get through it together.”
 


As much as the influencer industry has created more jobs for photographers, there are new hurdles too. Common learning curves for influencers are best crediting practices and navigating image rights. It can feel intuitive that if a photo is of you, that you retain some rights to it. Influencers can accidentally issue rights to use their image freely, when that picture actually belongs to the photographer. Julia reminded us that a good, collaborative relationship between creator and curator means drafting up a clear contract — and setting the standard for proper photo practices. For one, always credit the photographer, like @thehappilyeva frequently does, in the post caption. Advertisement     “I think the digital age is a challenge for everyone to understand copyright and the buying and selling and usage of imagery,” Julia said. “If you’re just starting as a photographer, it’s always a good idea to create a contract with your lawyer. If you’re just starting as an influencer, it’s always a good idea to credit your photographer if they require that for the usage of their imagery. This also includes passing along their photo credit information if you are sharing their image with another brand.”Her unforeseen career trajectory to working exclusively with influencers has also made Julia respect how tough a gig it is. She gets particularly miffed when so many people on the internet disparage her clients’ livelihoods, since she’s seen firsthand how much effort goes into a photo shoot.“I’ve known from day one how difficult it is to be an influencer,” Julia told me.Influencers are putting themselves in “the most vulnerable place” when they’re posing in front of a camera and conceiving how they want to narrativize their brand, Julia said.“There’s so many people out there who throw comments around like ‘I can be an influencer,’” she said. “Well, OK, then do it, and I’ll be there to cheer you on the whole way.”Over the last three years she’s worked with Eva, Julia said she’s grown to appreciate how tough-skinned women creators have to be to continue to talk about extremely personal facets of their lives and motherhood, in order to generate revenue — and keep supporting her own business. It’s a paradigm that deserves to be examined and also appreciated.“Eva shares her life with everyone,” Julia said. “She tells everyone about her highs, lows, her stories, her own life lessons, and listens back to everyone’s feedback.”The reason you and I, and others, are not actively pursuing an influencer career is exactly because that work is particularly onerous. And it’s why some of us prefer to be behind a camera, or a computer screen, capturing and writing about influencers instead. Advertisement     Until next time,Tanya

The comments sparked intense backlash and were ultimately deemed the “final straw” behind Kim’s decision to file for divorce earlier this year — something that she opened up about in detail on the last season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.
 


“All my dad had to say afterward was, ‘Write your speech next time, son,’” he added.Kanye also tweeted an apology to Kim in July last year, shortly after his comments caused huge controversy. Kim had shared a statement to her Instagram story days prior, writing, “Anyone who has [bipolar disorder] or has a loved one in their life who does, knows how incredibly complicated and painful it is to understand.”
 


“I would drink to take the stress away and knock the edge off,” Kanye said. “Drinking affected my health and the health of the people around me, because I already had a hair-trigger temper and this just heightened it.”
 


“I went into a manic episode in 2016 and I was placed under heavy medication,” he said. “Since then, I went on and off the medication which left me susceptible to other episodes, which my wife and family and fans have had to endure.” 
 


“I have to be next to my children as much as possible,” he said. “ I’m trying to express this in the most sane way possible, the most calm way possible: I need to be back at home. Advertisement     “If the enemy can separate Kimye, there's going to be millions of families that feel like that separation is OK,” Kanye said. “But when the kingdom, when God brings Kimye together, there's going to be millions of families that are going to be influenced to see that they can overcome the work of the separation of trauma the devil has used to capitalize to keep people in misery.”
 


In the two-part episode, Kanye repeatedly insisted that Kim is still his wife, before going on to say that their four children also want them to be together.“My kids want their parents to stay together. … I want us to be together,” he said.

405,"A vast web of Amazon review fraud lives online, and it’s designed to evade the company’s efforts to thwart it.","


One morning in late January, Jake picked up the box on his desk, tore through the packing tape, unearthed the iPhone case inside, snapped a picture, and uploaded it to an Amazon review he’d been writing. The review included a sentence about the case’s sleek design and cool, clear volume buttons. He finished off the blurb with a glowing title (“The perfect case!!”) and rated the product a perfect five stars. Click. Submitted.Jake never tried the case. He doesn’t even have an iPhone.Jake then copied the link to his review and pasted it into an invite-only Slack channel for paid Amazon reviewers. A day later, he received a notification from PayPal, alerting him to a new credit in his account: a $10 refund for the phone case he’ll never use, along with $3 for his trouble — potentially more, if he can resell the iPhone case. Advertisement  Jake is not his real name. He — along with the four other reviewers who spoke to BuzzFeed News for this story — wanted to remain anonymous for fear Amazon would ban their accounts. They are part of an extensive, invisible workforce fueling a review-fraud economy that persists in every corner of the largest marketplace on the internet. Drawn in by easy money and free stuff, they’ve seeded Amazon with fake five-star reviews of LED lights, dog bowls, clothing, and even health items like prenatal vitamins — all meant to convince you that this product is the best and bolster the sales of profiteers hoping to grab a piece of the Amazon Gold Rush. Meanwhile, sellers trying to play by the rules are struggling to stay afloat amid a sea of fraudulent reviews, and buyers are unwittingly purchasing inferior or downright faulty products. And Amazon is all but powerless to stop it.

The systems that create fraudulent reviews are a complicated web of subreddits, invite-only Slack channels, private Discord servers, and closed Facebook groups, but the incentives are simple: Being a five-star product is crucial to selling inventory at scale in Amazon’s intensely competitive marketplace — so crucial that merchants are willing to pay thousands of people to review their products positively.At just over $760 billion, Amazon is the world’s second most valuable company, behind Apple. CEO Jeff Bezos recently revealed the company counts more than 100 million paying Amazon Prime members globally, the $119-per-year membership that gets subscribers — the most devoted Amazon customers — free two-day shipping; music, TV, and movie streaming; access to an e-book library; and more. The company operates 13 third-party seller marketplaces around the world, and rents space to house those sellers’ inventory in more than 150 warehouses. In 2017, third-party merchants brought in $32 billion of revenue, and nearly 300,000 new sellers joined the marketplace last year alone.
 


Reviews are a buyer’s best chance to navigate this dizzyingly crowded market and a seller’s chance to stand out from the crowd. In a 2011 survey, 87% of consumers said a positive review confirmed their decision to purchase a product; online customer reviews are the second most trusted source of product information, behind recommendations from family and friends. But only 3% to 10% of customers leave reviews. The best way to make it on Amazon is with positive reviews, and the best way to get positive reviews is to buy them.In October 2016, Amazon banned free items or steep discounts in exchange for reviews facilitated by third parties. But Tommy Noonan, CEO of ReviewMeta, a site that analyzes Amazon listings, said what he calls “unnatural reviews” — that is, reviews, that his algorithm indicates might be fake — have returned to the platform. In June 2017, Noonan noticed an uptick in unnatural reviews along with an increase in the average rating of products, and the rate of growth hasn’t slowed since.Amazon’s ban didn’t stop sellers from recruiting reviewers. It only drove the practice underground. Reviewers are no longer simply incentivized with free stuff — they’re commissioned specifically for a five-star rating in exchange for cash. The bad reviews are harder to spot, too: They don’t contain any disclosures (because incentivized reviews are banned, and a disclosure would indicate that the review violates Amazon’s terms). Paid reviewers also typically pay for products with their own credit cards on their own Amazon accounts, with which they have spent at least $50, all to meet the criteria for a “verified purchase,” so their reviews are marked as such.Amazon won’t reveal how many reviews — fraudulent or total — it has. But based on his analysis of Amazon data, Noonan estimates that Amazon hosts around 250 million reviews. Noonan's website has collected 58.5 million of those reviews, and the ReviewMeta algorithm labeled 9.1%, or 5.3 million of the dataset's reviews, as “unnatural.”The Amazon spokesperson initially told BuzzFeed News the percentage of inauthentic reviews on the platform is “tiny,” but would not be more specific. In an email sent after the article’s publication, she wrote, “Inauthentic reviews made up less than 1% of all reviews on Amazon in March but even one is unacceptable.” That percentage reflects reviews Amazon has identified as inauthentic, but does not capture fake reviews designed to evade Amazon’s detection, as many are.Internal investigators also examine reviews and “non-Amazon forums” used for purchasing reviews, the spokesperson said. Amazon says it blocks or suspends accounts belonging to any of the parties involved.The statement also included that “Amazon is investing heavily to detect and prevent inauthentic reviews. In addition to advance detection, we use a machine-learned algorithm that gives more weight to newer, more helpful reviews, apply strict criteria to qualify for the Amazon verified purchase badge and enforce a significant dollar amount requirement to participate.”But conversations with sellers, customers, and reviewers reveal that review abuse continues, despite the company’s efforts.An unnatural review doesn’t necessarily mean a product is inferior. But the problem with paid-for reviews is that they make it difficult for consumers — even savvy ones — to know if what they’re buying is actually good or bad.In December, Kevin Votaw of Fort Collins, Colorado, ordered a highly rated Samsung Galaxy S8 screen protector for $10 using his girlfriend’s Amazon Prime account.It was, he said, “terrible”: The material was so thick he couldn’t type, making the product completely unusable. Frustrated, Votaw asked Amazon for a refund for the unreturnable product, which has a sticky, adhesive backing and can’t be reused. “I went back to the listing, thinking, ‘Surely all of these reviews are wrong,’” he said. But the product was unavailable — “like the company was rolling these protectors out in batches, then taking them off Amazon.”Amazon removed the screen protector listing after a BuzzFeed News inquiry, but two other listings with nearly identical product photography have more than 550 and 150 reviews each, all of which include a five-star rating and are unverified.Votaw has since found a protector with a mediocre 3.5-star rating that he’s happy with: “It works perfectly,” he said. “I’ll be leaving a great review.”
 


Type in “Amazon Review” into Facebook’s search box, and more than a hundred groups will pop up. Two of the more popular groups, Amazon Review Club and US — Amazon Review Club, which had 69,000 and 60,000 members, respectively, were recently shut down, but many more groups remain, with tens of thousands of members apiece.The groups’ posts read like the most random garage sale ever: lawn aerator shoes, lint removers, diaper pads, sex toys. New products are posted every minute. Most sellers are Chinese; in February, group members were warned that lunar holidays might slow down payments. Posts include a photo of the product up for grabs, with a description that says, “PP refund after review,” which means interested parties will receive a PayPal payment after proof they’ve published a review.One product listed in the group, a posture corrector designed to train your back to sit upright, was offering an unusually large commission: a $30 Amazon gift card that included $20 for the product and an extra $10 for the reviewer, who needed to be an Amazon Prime member and write a review that contained images. Advertisement  
 


Meanwhile, the 36,629-member /r/slavelabour subreddit, which is dedicated to getting “jobs done well below market rate,” has a formalized process for posting opportunities for would-be Amazon reviewers.
 


Sellers post “tasks” that include leaving positive reviews on their products — or one-star reviews on competitors’ products. One listing read, “The reviews don’t need to be verified or anything, so the task won’t take more than a minute of your time. I will send you the link to the product, you go and leave a brief 1 star review, and that’s it. I will pay $5 to you through Paypal as soon as the review is live on Amazon.” Within a week, 27 users had placed “bids” on the task, expressing their interest. Advertisement  
 


The most active reviewers become headhunters, working to recruit /r/slavelabour users into private Discord servers or Slack channels dedicated solely to feeding the Amazon review ecosystem.
 


Sellers typically pay between $4 to $5 per review, plus a refund of the product. Moderators take a cut off the top — around 20% to 25% for the Discord server I gained access to, but reviewers get to keep the item for free. Advertisement  On Jan. 13, the server’s moderator published a call for reviewers interested in “Before You Go To The Toilet Poop Spray,” a natural deodorizer carrying the “scent of Australia” by a company called Veil.
 


The poop spray’s listing shows a number of negative reviews, followed by a string of more positive reviews published after Jan. 13. Both positive and negative reviews are “verified purchases,” making it nearly impossible to differentiate between commissioned and genuine reviews. None of the reviews contain a disclosure that the product was received for free or that the review was paid for by the seller.In an email to BuzzFeed News, Greg Doney, a Veil Fragrances representative, acknowledged the company had paid for reviews, “but you have to as its [sic] really hard to launch a product without them.”When you take a closer look at the poop spray customers’ product review history, a pattern emerges. In addition to the poop spray, Amazon customers “Brian” and “Sharon” also gave a floating shelf bracket, which had been posted to the Discord server earlier, high marks.Brian said the product was a “really sturdy shelf” (it’s a bracket, not a stand-alone shelf); and Sharon noted they’re “easy to mount” and “durable.” The critical reviews, meanwhile, warn customers “DO NOT BUY!” and “HUGE waste of money,” citing wall damage and poorly made brackets. (The shelf company did not respond to a request for comment sent to its Amazon seller profile from BuzzFeed News.)The same accounts also reviewed “Boric Acid Suppositories” for vaginal health. The supplements are intended to be inserted into the vagina twice daily for two weeks, according to the product’s label. It purports to provide “vaginal health support” and “relief from odor, itchiness, pain, burning, and soreness.” The capsules were posted to the Discord server on Jan. 22 — and reviews from Brian and Sharon appeared shortly after that.Brian commented that his girlfriend was “having pain during sex and it was not because of me,” and the supplements cured her. Sharon mentioned it was the “best and cheapest” option for female hygiene and health. Neither of the reviews were marked as verified purchases. A five-star review by D. Pham even says the boric acid “doesn’t taste bad” even though the pill is not taken orally. (D. Pham also gave the floating shelf bracket five stars.)Meanwhile, a one-star review said that the product was a “nightmare,” citing how the pill “feels like a clump of cement mix in my vagina that is just gritty and totally dries it out.” Another said the suppository caused “an irritating burning sensation that lasted for hours.” The company did not respond to a request for comment.According to Dr. Jenny Jaque, assistant professor of gynecology at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine, boric acid suppositories should only be used under certain circumstances, under the supervision of a health care provider. “Boric acid is not candy, and you need to be careful,” she said. “It can cause irritation: Your vagina will hurt; you’d feel pain like your vagina is on fire.” She added that “it is really toxic if ingested by accident.”The Discord server recently posted turmeric curcumin vitamins, as well as myoinositol capsules, made by the same brand, listed in the prenatal vitamin category. The same reviewers — Sharon and D. Pham — gave the prenatal vitamins five stars. Both of their reviews were marked as verified purchases. The company did not respond to a request for comment.Amazon said it has applied stricter criteria for leaving verified purchase reviews. US reviewers must have a password-protected account and have made at least $50 in purchases on Amazon with a valid credit card.
 


During a hot summer in 2010, Jamie Whaley discovered a problem with her fitted sheets: They were breaking loose and ending up wrapped around her husband Jimmy’s ankles.
 


Whaley, then a 40-year-old nursing student in Texas, went in search of a solution. The suspenderlike designs on older sheet fasteners were too cumbersome, so Whaley developed her own, using a shock cord to make an easy button-enabled tightening mechanism. She called her new invention BedBand.Jimmy Whaley convinced his wife to start selling BedBands on Amazon. The product worked, and people wanted to buy it: Over the next few years, BedBand became Amazon’s best-selling sheet fastener, with more $700,000 in annual sales.Then, in October 2014, BedBand’s revenue was suddenly cut in half to about $350,000. Whaley, who had given up a nursing career, and Jim, who had also joined the company full time as COO, were devastated. “Someone was selling an exact replica of our product, and we couldn’t use our patent because it was pending,” said Whaley.Counterfeits, sold in bulk on AliExpress, had flooded Amazon’s sheet fastener market, and many gained dozens of five-star reviews very quickly. Over the next eight months, sales tanked. “There were tears,” said Whaley. “We wondered whether it was time to look for different jobs.” She was forced to lay off eight contractors, half her staff at the time.
 


Amazon took down the copycats once BedBand was granted a patent; it was a year after sales started dropping, but it was too late. The patent didn’t stop competitors from leaving negative one-star reviews on BedBand’s listings: “You start looking a bit deeper...and you can see they’ve left five-star reviews for our competitors. Or you’ll see that two different buyers have been reviewing the same type of products, our competitors’ products,” Whaley said.BedBand is currently the best-selling fastener, but that may not be for long. “It’s stressful, knowing that Amazon is our big store,” she said. To diversify revenue income, Whaley started selling BedBands on Walmart.com, Jet.com, Sears.com, and other retailers.Whaley was careful about how she discussed Amazon, which is her primary source of income —“I don’t want to mess where I nest,” she said — but seemed uneasy about being at the whim of Amazon’s algorithms: “Some days, all of a sudden we’re fifth. When you see a fast shift like that and [our competitors] end up with reviews all of a sudden, it’s frustrating. You just don’t know if tomorrow these competitors will knock our sales down.”
 


Paid review writing is the modern lemonade stand. According to the people who do it, it’s a quick, easy way to earn a few bucks and get free stuff — but not a career. And because the bidding, writing, and transaction happen online, it can all be done from a laptop in your bedroom.Many reviewers who spoke to BuzzFeed News are men in their late teens or early twenties who viewed the activity as a hobby. All wished to remain anonymous, out of fear of being caught by Amazon, which typically results in revoked reviewing privileges or, in the most severe cases, being banned from reusing the same delivery address or payment method with a new account.Josh, which is not his real name, is fairly new to reviewing; he discovered it through /r/slavelabour. He said he’s in it for the stuff: “You get to keep the product, so that’s a plus. It’s interesting to test out new and unique products in my opinion.”The most industrious paid reviewers become moderators and begin facilitating review deals themselves. Frank, whose name has been changed, manages an Amazon review Slack channel in his spare time. The entrepreneurial 18-year-old scours Amazon for products that aren’t well-rated and offers the product’s seller his Slack channel’s review services. Listings with a small number of reviews and a low-star rating are ideal candidates. “If [a product listing] has 30 reviews with an average of 2.5 stars, it’s worth it and I’ll reach out,” he said. Advertisement  Frank only earns about $20 from reviews a month, and sometimes a bit extra through seller negotiations. “I get about 30% for every review that one of our reviewers does,” he said. The bulk of Frank’s review income comes from reselling the items he reviews on eBay, where he makes “about a couple hundred” monthly.Another reviewer, whom we’ll call Evan, is part of a private 10-person Slack channel and makes about $75 a month from reviews. He’s left more than 150 reviews for items like weighted workout vests, 30-day hair growth pills, and car phone chargers.“It’s great for small investments and savings I’m working on,” he said. To write his commissioned reviews, Evan takes inspiration from existing reviews, “then I’ll cobble together a few keywords.”One reviewer, Devan, who asked to be identified by his first name only, however, denies any wrongdoing and doesn’t mind being named. The college student swears he provides nothing but his honest opinion and thinks incentivized Amazon reviews aren’t a scam. He did not know incentivized reviews violated Amazon's terms of service until BuzzFeed News told him. Advertisement  He did admit he benefits from incentivized reviews (which he writes daily): He reuses the bubble wrap and other shipping materials from Amazon for his eBay business, through which he resells items bought on clearance.But incentivized reviews on Amazon, he says, are just an evolution of marketing tactics that have been around for a long time. “At a sporting event, Mountain Dew will hand out soda for free, and if people like it they post on social media or whatever. It’s kind of the same thing, and like at Costco or Walmart, where you get free samples,” Devan said.“Some of these sellers are mom and pop shops, and a lot of companies just want your honest feedback...I know a lot of people who [review] aren’t in it for the money. They’re just trying to find better products for people,” Devan said.Devan's right — there are “mom and pop shops” on Amazon, like Whaley’s BedBand business. But an increasing number of sellers are folks with little e-commerce experience or product expertise, looking to take advantage of Amazon’s millions of customers — and they need high ratings to supplant the existing best-seller.

Through the “Amazon FBA” or “Fulfillment by Amazon” program, anyone can open their own Amazon storefront. It’s easy: Buy products in bulk from an online wholesale supplier, like AliExpress, then send the inventory to one of Amazon’s warehouses, where Amazon will take care of all aspects of distribution, from payment to order fulfillment to shipping.David, whose name has been changed, is an FBA seller who has considered buying five-star reviews. “It feels like the people making the most money are those who are violating Amazon’s terms of service,” he said.David didn’t invent anything. He didn’t go to medical school. But he makes about $1,000 a month selling suture training pads for medical professionals on Amazon. “It’s a hobby, like video games. Plus, Warren Buffett said something like, ‘If you want to make money, you have to practice making money.’”
 


David got started using a site called Jungle Scout. A subscription, which costs about $350 per year, provides metrics that show what products Amazon customers are buying a lot of — and features categories where the top seller has a poor or average star rating. That mediocre star rating indicates that there’s an opportunity in the market for another seller to poach some of that low-rated product’s customers. “What I found were suture pads, like a simulation skin for medical students. Then I went on Alibaba. All the Chinese suppliers are on there and they fulfill bulk orders.”David — and other FBA sellers like him — swarmed the Amazon suture pad market. “The original guy, the guy whose product was featured on Jungle Scout, started losing a lot of sales because of all the competition,” he said. It became apparent, according to David, that the seller, Your Design Medical, was leaving one- and two-star reviews on competitors’ products. (Amazon said that, after an investigation, it did not find Your Design Medical guilty of reviews abuse. Your Design Medical did not respond to a request for comment sent to its customer support email address from BuzzFeed News.)The only new seller performing well, in spite of the original seller’s bad reviews, was also, in David’s view, “cheating the system.” “The listing had 33 five-star reviews. There’s no way you can get 33 reviews in two months. That’s unusual for a product like this,” he said.In the end, David didn’t end up buying reviews — but added that “if I really needed FBA for my income, I would have.”
 


Many compensated reviewers, and the sellers who hire them, don’t see themselves as bad actors. They’re just one of the thousands of other reviewers and sellers doing the exact same thing. Taking shortcuts, they say, is just leveling the playing field. Inside Amazon’s massive marketplace, there are lots of places to hide, to optimize, to cheat — and, because sellers can’t control the algorithms, they’ll do everything they can to sway them.Amazon has tried to crack down on the review fraud on its platform. The company has sued more than 1,000 people for writing or selling fake reviews. In its 2015 suit against freelancers on the website Fiverr, Amazon said it “takes the credibility of its customer reviews seriously,” and also asserted, “While small in number, these reviews can significantly undermine the trust that consumers and the vast majority of sellers and manufacturers place in Amazon, which in turn tarnishes Amazon’s brand.”
 


In its seller marketplace guidelines, provided to BuzzFeed News by a third-party seller, Amazon says that sellers “may not offer compensation for a review, and you may not review your own products or your competitors’ products.” Sellers can “ask buyers to write a review in a neutral manner,” without asking specifically for positive reviews, or “ask reviewers to change or remove their reviews.” And yet all of these behaviors persist.
 


Sam Feldman started selling CardBuddy, a stick-on wallet for phones, on Amazon as a college student. CardBuddy was the first leather product of its kind on Amazon, but Feldman didn’t have a patent. Competitors quickly copied the product, its packaging, and even used CardBuddy’s photos. One seller had gained 500 reviews in two months. According to Feldman, the reviews were “clearly fake.”“One day my sales were cut in half, and it was so upsetting,” Feldman told BuzzFeed News. “It stayed like that forever. More competition came, and maybe they had better photos or better titles…but I don’t know,” he said.An Amazon spokesperson said, “We encourage rights owners who have product authenticity concerns to notify us; we investigate all claims thoroughly. We remove suspected counterfeit items as we become aware of them, and we permanently remove bad actors from selling on Amazon.” Feldman says that the company promptly took down the copycat listing and marked CardBuddy as the copyright holder of its own photos. But according to Feldman, it took a few months for Amazon to remove the hundreds of disingenuous reviews.Feldman thinks Amazon could do more to tackle fraudulence on the platform: “From one side, Amazon started this business, and they’re inviting people in to sell on their website. Amazon is looking out for the system as a whole, and not for me, which I understand. But, at the same time, what do you do when someone’s making a living off of it?” Advertisement     Shutting down disingenuous reviews is tricky for Amazon. By doing so, the company risks alienating sellers, a core part of its business. In 2017, more than half of units sold on Amazon globally were from third-party sellers, and more than 140,000 of what Amazon defines as “small and medium-sized businesses” surpassed $100,000 in sales. The company earns revenue not only from hosting product listings but from each sale made through the site, from fulfillment fees based on weight for each shipping order and use of storage real estate in its fulfillment centers. Revenue from seller services accounted for $23 billion in 2016.Amazon is the place to be for e-commerce sellers and is increasingly seen as a utility. In 2017, Amazon accounted for nearly half of all e-commerce sales in the US (44%) with $196.8 billion in sales.
 


Like entrepreneurs during the dot-com boom, people are rushing to sell on Amazon, and sites like AliExpress make it easy for anyone to acquire massive amounts of inventory. (AliExpress even runs its own fulfillment program.) This rush — which includes acquiring positive reviews to rise to the top of Amazon’s search algorithms to sell off that inventory as quickly as possible — can displace sellers, who are less in tune with the velocity and inhumanity of the platform’s algorithms and how punishing they can be as a result.The company, through lawsuits, human moderators, and algorithms, is trying to keep fake reviews off the site, but the review mills that produce those disingenuous ratings may always be one step ahead of Amazon’s ability to moderate them.Like Twitter, Facebook, and Google, Amazon set out to create a neutral platform and invited the internet to come and make something of it. But like Twitter, Facebook, and Google, Amazon allowed its platform to be big and comprehensive — and grow far beyond its control. But the difference between Amazon and, say, Twitter, is that its users’ livelihoods are dependent on the former.Meanwhile, Amazon’s customers — left in the dark about the sophisticated mechanics behind the seemingly genuine reviews that guide their purchasing decisions — continue to buy products of shoddy quality that don’t meet their expectations.Whaley paused for a while when asked what more Amazon could do to keep reviews off the platform. “The fake reviews and sales are so intertwined now. I don’t know how they can get rid of it. It seems hopeless. The reviews process was amazing when they started it, but it’s been so corrupted now,” she said.With a heavy sigh, Whaley continued: “Amazon really is— It is a great site, but as prevalent as fake reviews are over the internet, I don’t know how anybody can get in front of it. Cheaters are always going to cheat.” ●

406,"""The best deals are usually for the worst products.""","If you want to avoid the chaos of Black Friday, do your shopping between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. Camping out all night doesn't mean you're going to get the best doorbuster deals. In fact, doorbuster sales are really just an advertising gimmick. The best deals may actually be on the worst products. Local stores often have deals that are just as good as the giant department stores. Don't be tempted by time-sensitive deals. Prices may be adjusted to make the deals seem better. No one is checking in the back for you, sorry. Leave your credit cards at home. Use cash. Using a cart on Black Friday is a recipe for disaster, so use bags instead. It might seem scary and intimidating, but talking to other shoppers can really improve your Black Friday experience. Stores sometimes create new floor maps for the Black Friday rush. Some ""new"" products aren't always new. Many stores won't file incident reports relating to customer confrontations on Black Friday. On Black Friday, stores will try hard to get you to sign up for their credit card. Don't. Don't get fooled by mail-in rebates. Some stores may roll out deals as early as Wednesday, if not before. Don't wear red to Target if you want to have an uninterrupted shopping experience. And finally, the biggest Black Friday shopping secret is to just wait for other holiday sales. Good luck!"
407,"The new season of Netflix’s real-estate reality show promised drama, but didn’t quite deliver. (Spoilers ahead.)","


Estelle Tang: OK, folks. After a super dramatic Season 3 finale — Chrishell making a hasty exit from Christine’s über-goth wedding — and over a year’s worth of tabloid gossip, Selling Sunset is back for its fourth season. It seems like they have bigger celebrity guests and fancier houses, a testament to how the show’s star has risen. But let’s be honest, real estate plays second fiddle in this show. What was your favorite scene?Scaachi Koul: Christine walking around wearing what appeared to be a bedazzled, tiny folding chair for a purse. It’s exactly what I want from Christine: unpredictable, unrealistic, fancy absurdity.Stephanie McNeal: Christine’s baby shower with a real sloth and a shirtless man covered with body paint. I also loved when Chrishell bought her house. Her excitement seemed so genuine, and she is just so likable. Also, I enjoyed imagining I owned that house. Advertisement     Michael Blackmon: My favorite scene was the ending, when all of the agents finally confront Christine about her ridiculous lies. But it took until the end of the whole season! They wasted my time! I felt like I waited the entire season for something to happen between Christine and the other agents. The big moment where she and Mary hash things out was so underwhelming.SK: That’s kind of Selling Sunset’s way, no big scenes until the very last episode. That’s all ya get.SM: The teaser of Jason and Chrishell kissing is a federal crime, against me personally. How dare you give us 10 episodes of “Everybody Hates Christine” and then throw that in as a cliffhanger to make sure I watch next season.MB: I related to Heather storming off at the end. That’s how I get when I’m so frustrated and the person I’m trying to reason with is a…uh, fickle individual, to say the least.
 


ET: Did you find Season 4 compelling?SK: At the beginning of the pandemic, I wrote a profile of Adam DiVello, the guy who made Selling Sunset (and The Hills and Laguna Beach, a real pro). And I told him that he somehow makes boring, hot, blonde white women so compelling that I have ended up watching four seasons of a show that I can’t really describe as “interesting.” No one is that compelling, no one’s storylines pull me in, I shouldn’t actually care about any of these people, and here I am rooting for Chrishell as if she is my long-lost sister. I JUST WANT HER TO THRIVE.With Selling Sunset, you have to decide if the finale’s confrontation (something that happens every season) is worth sitting through a bunch of episodes where they just roam open houses for 40 minutes. They didn’t even address Heather’s cursed tattoo that she got when she and Tarek got engaged! Give me a whole season of the tattoo fallout, come on! Advertisement     SM: I was so pissed they never brought up the tattoo. “Yes Sir, Mr. El Moussa,” deserved its time in the spotlight.MB: Not really. It seemed like the agents were having the same conversation every time they met up with one another. Even the addition of Vanessa and Emma, who are both kind of boring, didn’t help.ET: How does everyone else feel about Vanessa and Emma? With Vanessa, I thought it was interesting that they brought in someone who is an ex–soap actor (obvious link to Chrishell) and also kind of touchy-feely and willing to try to help Christine — she was obviously supposed to be a bridge of some kind.SM: The jury is out for me on Vanessa. I can’t tell if she is too innocent and nice to play ball with these ladies, and thus just ends up on the side of whoever she last spoke to, or if she’s the smartest one of all and is playing 4D chess, stirring the pot and moving the drama along.Emma is a supervillain. I did some research, and her website for her smash hit food business has no way to actually buy the food and no descriptions of the products. Hello, where are the vegan empanadas? I need a five-part documentary on her and her life. When she explained how she made her money as a teen, apparently investing in the stock market to enough success that she financed her entire family’s fortune? She only flies private! I can’t.ET: I laughed when Emma said she has to fly private because she has a big dog.SK: Emma feels like the only person who could conceivably be a match for Christine. She’s newish, she’s got a little history with her, she’s unafraid, and she looks like a Christine-light. It’s like what Mean Girls suggested was sure to happen at the end of the movie. Honestly, I hope they eventually put their differences aside and join up and really set this show on fire. Did you know Emma is 29? She’s just one of those women who looks like she’s either 19 or 55. Good for her, I guess.
 


SM: Anyone who talks that much about how busy they are and how many businesses they have — I automatically assume something is fishy (and NOT the good, Emma-Leigh & Co. cauliflower crab cake kind of fishy).ET: It was perfect when Vanessa was like, “I have never heard of a cheeseburger empanada. That’s not a thing.”But we must discuss the Christine of it all. She had already graduated to supervillain, and she just leaned into that even more. This is obviously by design, but I cannot make heads or tails of her story about getting engaged to Emma’s ex. It’s almost beside the point whether it’s true or not — the bigger issue is that she seems incapable of being accountable to her friends and colleagues (as Mary pointed out). But in that finale, either she is a great actor or she really is someone who does seem deeply emotionally wounded, I think? Have I been drawn in by her unimpeachable richer-than-thou aesthetic and bouncy hair? Probably.MB: Christine wants to control things that are literally out of her hands. You can’t just say you miss Mary after treating her and her new friends like crap. It’s like her brain short-circuits when she can figure out how to be the victim in any given situation. I’m not even a Davina stan, but it was ridiculous that Christine wanted Davina to lie for her about the engagement story.SM: Christine wants to be the star of the show, and I think she is kind of short-circuiting because Chrishell is the star of the show. I also think she seems to be wavering about whether she wants to keep doing this or just be an influencer and enjoy Christian’s fortune. Which I get. The engagement lie felt half-assed. I don’t think her heart’s in it.SK: I actually found a lot of the Christine plotlines really unbearable, not because I think she’s an unpleasant person — in fact, by reality show standards, she is e-very-thing — but because there seems to be a lot of trauma around the birth of her son. I thought it was weird that the show had her explain how truly awful her birth story was, and then you can kind of tell that her new motherhood is pretty fatiguing (which the show also never acknowledges). She seems checked out at the parties, a little disconnected even from herself, and she isn’t the bombastic, unapologetic personality she was in the last few seasons. I don’t think this is permanent — she’s merely resting — but I don’t think we got Christine at her sharpest. I’m sure she’ll come back with a vengeance next season. She just isn’t at the top of her TV villain game; she doesn’t seem to want to play like she used to, and it’s no fun watching her be the bad guy when she isn’t relishing it to some degree. Maybe her priorities have changed, but to be clear, I do not think motherhood would or should preclude any woman, especially Christine, from fulfilling her full reality TV villain potential. Advertisement     ET: The return of Davina was somewhat underwhelming, but I find her fascinating. She is a black hole for charisma. Watching her interact with other people is like watching an alien following the How to Be Human handbook. Her breathy pandering to Jason and the other agents is excruciating. When she told Jason, “I love the access to you,” I aged 19 years out of disgust. But her outfits have gotten a lot better.SK: They are technically better in terms of labels, but her style is...terrible. There’s something so false about it — I feel like she’s trying to dress like Christine in order to keep a plotline going. That black number with the gold buttons and feather trim she wore when catching up with Christine was cute, but then the way she styled it was a disaster: messy bun, gold and silver jewelry, a look of absolute panic on her face. It isn’t working for me.MB: I think Davina realized what a big mistake she made by trying to ice out Chrishell and be on the mean girl side with Christine. I still don’t trust her because it’s so obvious what she’s doing. That said, I still want her to get a check. Even bad people deserve an income!ET: On the other hand, I am obsessed with Maya. Mary says this, but Maya is able to blatantly stir the pot because people love her, and she really doesn’t seem to care about the drama either way. She spent a lot of time with Christine and Davina this season which seems more like producer logistics than anything else, having her plant seeds of chaos among the villains — she’s always just saying funny naughty things and then literally walking away. Like, “What did you think about dinner last night?” or “Oh, where is Davina going to sit when she comes back?” Advertisement     MB: I freakin’ LOVED Maya this season. I think she is — Erika Jayne voice — “a sniper from the side.” I think she sees how ridiculous the drama is, and she calls it out in hilarious ways. I also like that she loves being pregnant. She makes me wanna get pregnant! Her life seems very full and happy. Team Maya all the way!SK: Are we watching the same show? Maya feels rudderless to me! Even when she stirs the pot, it feels so benign that any of the girls could’ve said that to get things going.MB: SCREAMING at “rudderless.” To me it shows Maya’s independence when she makes those comments. Like she couldn’t care less about these silly alliances. She’s there to get her check and go!SM: Maya has the perfect setup for a reality TV show cast member. She reveals nothing about her life, never has any personal drama, yet gets to reap the rewards of being on TV. All she has to do is randomly show up at dinners and be in the office.ET: This season overall wasn’t that juicy — the really meaty stuff like Heather and Tarek’s wedding and Chrishell and Jason’s relationship are presumably coming next season. Do you think the show suffers in comparison to more traditional/long-running reality shows because of the shorter seasons or any other factors? I like that the seasons are relatively short — it’s easy to get invested even when not very much happens.SK: I think they also have the added struggle of working with the housing market; they not only have to get clearance to film in all those houses, but to get the sellers or buyers on board, and to be in production when a big house sells. It’s a lot of moving parts, plus the girls’ personal lives. Advertisement     MB: I think it was just a bad choice to give us a filler season when the previous one was so juicy. All that divorce drama and now that we know Chrishell is dating Jason — a bad decision, imo — it kind of felt like they were playing in our faces. Show us the goods! Like, there’s no way dating your boss ends up being a good thing. I think we’re gonna see Chrishell become a villain next season.ET: Who is your favorite secondary character? I loathed Christian and his little “They just want to be rich like you” speech. But I am obsessed with Romain. When he said “It’s been five years!” about the Emma and Christine drama, I almost cried laughing because he was right. He’s the only relatively normal person on the show.SK: I have really come around on the young man named after lettuce. I wish him nothing but moissanite dreams.MB: I hated that comment from Christian, too! And I’m not defending him at all, but he is only getting one side of the story, from a person who is unreliable. But he loves her so I guess that’s clouding his judgment.SM: I hate to admit this, but I liked Tarek. He only added to the scenes he was in. He had a lot of energy when he was on camera, and I thought he actually helped Heather calm down a lot in the final confrontation. I’m kind of excited to see them get married. Also, I like Heather more now. I know, I hate myself.MB: Not a secondary character, but my heart broke for Amanza when she found out about her ex giving up custody of their kids. It's frustrating that someone who helped her create two children can simply bow out of the huge responsibility of raising them, and without giving a proper explanation. I really hope good things happen for her and her children in the future.SM: Poor Amanza. I love her so much. Honestly, I kind of wish this stuff wasn’t on the show. It’s so heavy, and I feel like it doesn't fit the vibe and is a bit jarring. But I get why she wants to talk about it, and that’s her prerogative. Advertisement     ET: That arc does highlight everyone else’s petty ridiculousness. We’re seeing $50 million mansions and couture dresses and yachts, and fights about perceived slights from years ago. Amanza is a working single mother, going through an experience that some viewers can actually relate to.SK: I think the show struggles with balancing the women’s work stuff and their personal stuff. Christine’s season was almost all personal because she was taking some leave, while Chrishell’s was all work.I do think we have to talk about the preview for next season, which really teased Chrishell dating Jason.ET: Do you remember how much tension there was in earlier seasons about Jason favoring Mary because they used to be in a relationship and seeming to give her all the best listings? That will probably happen with Chrishell.
 


MB: Mary and Jason have such an interesting relationship. Like, part of me feels like it shows a level of maturity to be able to work with your ex, but I am also weirded out by it? And now that Chrishell, one of Mary’s good friends, is dating her ex, I’m wondering how she feels about that. I don’t know if I could handle it.We also gotta talk about Mary and Jason’s dog party! White people LOVE their dogs.SM: How funny was it though when Jason was telling Mary to calm down because “it’s her baby’s birthday”? Also Jason’s poems.SK: I had to watch the dog birthday party on mute because it truly made me so mad. I don’t want to hear any adult men writing poetry for their dogs.MB: Emily Dickinson could never!ET: Jason is low-key the most chaotic person on this show. Inviting Christine to the dog party, inviting Emma to replace Christine at the brokerage — but he gets away with it because he’s a dude. Advertisement     SM: This show makes me mad because I want one of the houses. I need to deal with that on a personal level.MB: I love that the show makes me feel like I could sell homes. It makes it seem so simple even though I’m sure it isn’t.ET: Do you care about the Newport office that Jason announced in the finale and presumably the new franchise that will follow? Do you think you’ll watch it?MB: Yes! I will absolutely watch every iteration of the Selling franchise. It's a good, low-stakes drama. It fuels me! I don’t think they did a good job of getting people interested in the new office, but I’ll definitely watch it because I’m so invested in this series. Selling Tampa is coming in mid-December. I’ve seen screeners, and it completely makes up for the drama Selling Sunset failed to deliver this season. I can't say too much — or anything, really — but it's the workplace reality drama we deserve!SM: I say I don’t care, but I’ll probably watch.ET: Finally, what were the worst parts of the season? For me it’s a toss-up between Tarek’s trucker hats, the way nobody could seem to remember where Vanessa was from, and how 10% of the season was just compliments about Christine’s body “bouncing back” from childbirth.SM: Every time Emma said “Alesso’s house.”SK: Christine walking around wearing what appeared to be a bedazzled, tiny folding chair for a purse.MB: I think Emma’s gentrified empanadas were a low point. And the poor sloth who had to attend Christine’s party. I felt bad for them. ●

408,"Everything you need to know about roasting the perfect turkey — from seasoning, to carving, to making a delicious homemade gravy.","


So we went ahead and created a simple, foolproof method for roasting turkey that'll help ease your nerves. You can find the full recipe at the bottom of this post.


By rethinking the entire process, we created a 100% manageable game plan for roasting the ultimate Thanksgiving turkey.
 


Next, we decided to take a closer look at these steps to see how they can be perfected. Ready for a closer look?


And if you simply want the recipe, just scroll down to the bottom of this post.
 


Servings: 15INGREDIENTS1 15-pound turkey¼ cup kosher salt2 tablespoons dark brown sugar1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper1 tablespoon granulated garlicCooking oil of preference, for drizzlingTurkey Stock1 turkey carcass1 medium yellow onion, quartered3 carrots, peeled and halved3 stalks of celery, cut into thirdsKosher salt, to tasteCooking oil of preference, for drizzlingCold water2 bay leaves Gravy ⅓ cup rendered turkey fat or butter⅓ cup all-purpose flour1 quart turkey stock or chicken stock1 bunch of fresh sage (optional)Kosher salt, to tasteFreshly ground black pepper, to tastePREPARATIONOne day before serving, prepare the turkey for brining. Pat dry with paper towels. Set the neck aside for the stock. Cut off the wing tips and set aside with the neck. Butcher the turkey into 8 pieces: 2 breasts, 2 legs, 2 thighs, and 2 wings. Set aside the carcass for the stock.Combine the salt, brown sugar, pepper, and granulated garlic in a small bowl.Set a wire rack inside a baking sheet. Place the turkey parts skin-side up on the rack and generously sprinkle with the seasoning blend. Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Make the stock: Preheat the oven to 450˚F (230˚C).Place the turkey carcass, wing tips, and neck on a baking sheet with the onion, carrots, and celery. Season lightly with salt and drizzle with oil. Roast for 30-45 minutes, or until the carcass and vegetables are deep brown. Transfer the roasted vegetables, turkey carcass, and other parts to a large stock pot and cover with cold water. Add the bay leaves and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Continue to simmer (don’t boil!) for 3 hours.  Advertisement     Strain the stock, discarding the solids. The stock will keep 5 days in fridge and 3 months in the freezer.From the still-warm baking sheet from roasting the carcass, pour any rendered fat into a small bowl. Add about 1 cup of water to the pan and scrape off any browned bits from roasting process, then pour into a separate bowl. Reserve for gravy.Make the gravy: Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the turkey fat and flour, stirring to combine. Cook the fat and flour together, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes. This is a roux--you are cooking out the raw flour taste and deepening the flavor. Gradually add the stock to the roux, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Bring to a boil, continuing to stir until thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste.Remove the pan from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Store in the refrigerator until ready to warm for serving with the turkey. The gravy will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.Two hours before you are ready to serve the turkey, preheat the oven to 425°F (220˚C). Remove the turkey parts from the fridge and drizzle with oil before placing in the hot oven. Roast for 30 minutes, then rotate the baking sheet to ensure even browning. Reduce the oven temperature to 400˚F (200˚C). Continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 160°F (70˚C), or the thigh registers 170˚F (77˚C). Start checking after about 20 minutes, removing any parts from the oven as they reach proper temperature so that they don’t overcook.Once all parts are done, loosely cover with foil and let rest for 5-10 minutes while you warm the gravy. Add the gravy and sage, if using, to a medium saucepan over low heat and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Season to taste with more salt and pepper, if needed. Serve the turkey with the gravy and your favorite Thanksgiving dishes.Enjoy!

409,Repeat after me: Don’t wash the turkey.,"


When it comes to holiday meals, there’s definitely one guest you don’t want at your dinner table: food-borne illness. It happens when disease-causing germs or harmful toxins contaminate the food we eat. The most common food-borne germs in the US are Salmonella, norovirus, Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus. Advertisement     The typical symptoms of food-borne illness (also referred to as food poisoning) include diarrhea, vomiting, and cramping and they can start anywhere from hours to days after you eat the contaminated food. Most of the time, food-borne illnesses will go away in a few days and medical treatment isn't necessary. But people with weaker immune systems — pregnant women, the elderly, chemotherapy patients — are at higher risk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that each year about 1 in 6 Americans (or 48 million people) get sick and 3,000 die from food-borne illnesses.
 


Thanksgiving presents a lot of opportunities for food to get contaminated and make people sick. Cooks (both seasoned and inexperienced) are preparing a bunch of different of foods they don't normally make and for a large number of people. There’s usually a raw turkey involved, which is much bigger and difficult to cook than your average chicken. And food generally sits out for a longer time and leftovers are eaten days, if not weeks, after the meal. So, what are the most common cooking mistakes that lead to food-borne infections and how can you avoid them? We reached out to germ expert Kelly Reynolds, associate professor of environmental health at the University of Arizona, and consulted the most recent Thanksgiving food safety guidelines from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to find out.
 


So you spent weeks planning the menu, shopping at different grocery stores, and finding Pinterest recipes — and come Thanksgiving day, you wake up sick as a dog. But the feast must go on, right? Yes, but you should get someone to fill in for you or help out. “You want to minimize the chances that you contaminate the food or surfaces that your guests will come into contact with,” Reynolds says. But the type of illness matters, too.If you're sick with any kind of contagious stomach bug, you really shouldn't cook. ""If you don't wash your hands properly after using the bathroom (which most people don’t), you can easily contaminate the food you’re cooking with fecal matter containing pathogens like norovirus,"" Reynolds says. If you do decide to cook, wash your hands constantly or wear plastic gloves just to be safe. Advertisement     Colds and flus, on the other hand, are usually transmitted through the respiratory route and not through ingestion — so it's more likely that you'd get someone sick by contaminating surfaces like countertops, plates, doorknobs, etc. If you're going to cook, just wash your hands often (especially after touching your face or blowing your nose) and disinfect common surfaces before your guests arrive.
 


Even if you aren't sick, you can still cross-contaminate food and surfaces with germs from your hands, especially if you’re handling raw poultry and meat. ""Proper hand washing with soap and water is probably the best thing you can do, but most people don’t remember to wash their hands properly,"" Reynolds said. So here’s how to do it the right way:1. Run your hands under clean, running water (hot or cold).2. Lather up your hands and fingers with soap.3. Scrub for 20 seconds (or as long as it takes to sing the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice).4. Rinse your hands with clean water.5. Dry your hands completely using a clean towel, a dryer, or let them air-dry.
 


""Bacteria multiply the fastest between 40 degrees and 140 degrees Fahrenheit, which we call the 'danger zone' because the bacteria will grow to dangerous levels that cause serious illness,"" Reynolds says. So you definitely don’t want your turkey sitting at room temperature for hours. “What happens is the outside layer of the turkey gets in the danger zone while the inside is still frozen, so by the time the whole thing is thawed bacteria have grown at a rapid rate in certain parts of the turkey,"" Reynolds says. You can minimize the time your turkey spends in the danger zone by thawing it safely using one of the methods below.
 


These methods ensure that the turkey thaws at a steady, safe temperature — one that is warm enough to actually help it defrost, but still cold enough to keep bacteria from multiplying rapidly. Thawing is an art form, folks.Refrigerator: If you're thawing your frozen turkey in the fridge, the USDA recommends allowing 24 hours for every four to five pounds. ""If you have a big turkey it can take days to thaw, so plan ahead,"" Reynolds says. You'll want to keep the bird in it's original wrapper and place it in a pan to catch any raw juices that leak out — once it's thawed, you can keep it in the fridge for up to two days.Cold water: ""The bath of cold water will help the frozen turkey thaw faster and more evenly,"" Reynolds says. Make sure to wrap your turkey securely in a plastic bag so water can't leak in — you do not want a waterlogged turkey, she says. Submerge the whole bird in cold water, and the USDA recommends 30 minutes for every pound. ""You'll need to change the water every 30 minutes because it'll get too cold and stop thawing evenly,"" Reynolds says. Once the turkey is thawed from the cold water bath, cook it immediately. Advertisement     Microwave: ""The microwave will thaw your turkey much faster so it's spending less time in the danger zone,"" Reynolds says. But do not bank on using this method until you've checked that your turkey actually fits in there! Read the owner's manual to find out which power level to use and how many minutes you'll need per pound. You'll want to remove the outside wrapping and place it in a dish to catch the raw juices, then cook immediately once it's thawed.
 


""Fresh and frozen turkeys are both safe, the only real difference is that frozen turkeys just last longer so you can buy them way ahead of time and store in the freezer,"" Reynolds says. So if you are going the fresh turkey route, just make sure to buy it no more than one or two days before cooking and keep it in the fridge right up until cooking time to keep the bacteria from multiplying.""When you store the fresh turkey in the fridge, you want to avoid it coming into contact with any other food in there since the raw juices can contain bacteria like Salmonella,"" Reynolds says. She suggests keeping your bird wrapped in a plastic bag and placing it in a pan large enough to catch any juices or drippings. ""Make sure it isn’t touching any other food items, especially raw fruits and vegetables that won’t get cooked.""
 


Seriously, just make the stuffing at home where you know what’s going in there. The USDA warns against buying pre-stuffed fresh turkeys because they aren't made under controlled conditions and you can't ensure they were handled properly, so the stuffing could be contaminated with tons of rapidly multiplying bacteria. If you want to buy a pre-stuffed turkey, opt for frozen instead and follow instructions to ensure it cooks properly (more on that in a bit).
 


If you already do this, don't worry — you aren't alone. According to the most recent food safety survey from the FDA, a whopping 68% of Americans said they *always* rinse their turkey before cooking. ""We all grew up doing this and it's like second-nature for many people, so it's a hard habit to break,"" Reynolds says. ""Rinsing the turkey doesn't remove enough germs to make any difference — it just makes it easier for raw juices to spread around and get all over the sink and counters, increasing the risk of cross-contamination,"" Reynolds says. Those raw juices can splash around and contaminate other food you're cooking with — things like Salmonella and Campylobacter, which cause nasty diarrheal illnesses. ""If there's any bacteria on the turkey, it's the cooking that will remove it because the high temperatures actually kill bacteria — water doesn't,"" Reynolds says.Still not convinced? Read this article about why you shouldn't wash your poultry.
 


When you're preparing all these different types of food on one day and presumably in one kitchen, it's easy for foods and surfaces to get cross-contaminated. So make sure to keep any raw poultry, meat, and seafood separate from foods that won't get cooked — that means when you're shopping at the store, when you're storing all the food in the fridge, and when you're cooking the big meal. ""Don't let bacteria from the raw juices spread to other foods that won't get cooked (or cooked long enough) to kill that bacteria,"" Reynolds says.Ideally, you'd reserve one area of your kitchen or counter space just for preparing the raw poultry and meat so it's as far as possible from the food that won't get cooked or is already cooked — like finger foods and appetizers, fresh salads, fruits, etc. You should also consider using separate cutting boards, plates, and utensils if possible.
 


If you're using the same kitchenware to prepare all of your food, that's totally fine. We don't all have kitchens full of multiple cutting boards, knives, and mixing bowls to use for separate foods like Ina Garten. But you do want to get rid of any raw juices as soon as possible so there's less of a chance for the bacteria to spread around.You can do this by washing all food-contact surfaces that touch raw poultry, meat, seafood, and eggs with hot soapy water and drying with a clean towel, Reynolds says. You should also sanitize any surfaces (like countertops and microwave plates) in between using them to prep raw meat or poultry and other foods. You should also try to mop up raw juices with a paper towel you can throw away instead of a sponge or a dishcloth that you'll use again. Advertisement     
 


It's okay to cook your stuffing inside the turkey, Reynolds says, but as long as you do so properly and you use a thermometer to make sure the stuffing reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit. The CDC recommends waiting to stuff the turkey until right before it'll go in the oven, and stuffing it loosely so everything will get cooked. ""Any stuffing that doesn't reach 165 degrees may have bacteria that cause food-borne illness,"" Reynolds says.Seriously, if you aren’t sure about cooking your stuffing inside the turkey or you're a brand-new cook, maybe just cook it in a casserole dish. ""The dish ensures your stuffing will get cooked evenly and it's much easier to see if it’s done,"" Reynolds says. For more stuffing tips, check out the USDA stuffing and food safety page.
 


""You cannot tell if the turkey is done by the color or the way it looks, it could still have parts inside that are raw or undercooked,"" Reynolds says. First, the USDA recommends setting your oven no lower than 325 degrees Fahrenheit and placing the bird in a shallow roasting pan. ""You should use a meat or food thermometer to make sure the internal temperature has reached at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit,"" Reynolds says. Never cook a turkey without a meat thermometer.

""Some people just stick the thermometer in one part of the turkey, but you could still have other parts that haven't reached 165 degrees yet,"" Reynolds says. So don't just jab the thermometer in the top of the nicely roasted breast and call it a day. Poke it all around the turkey — near the breast, the thigh bones, under the wings, and inside the stuffing cavity — to make sure the whole thing is completely cooked.
 


If you're cooking any sauces or gravies, you want to make sure they don't sit around at room temperature until the turkey is ready to be served. ""If gravies and sauces are sitting in a pot in the danger zone for over two hours, bacteria can reach dangerous levels,"" Reynolds says. So make sure to reheat your gravy and sauces by bringing them to a rolling boil on the stovetop. Who likes lukewarm gravy anyways?
 


If your Thanksgiving turkey and side dishes have been sitting out in the kitchen or dining room literally all day long, don't eat them. ""When cooked food is sitting at room temperature, in that danger zone, bacteria are multiplying rapidly and the more bacteria you're exposed to, the more likely you are to actually get sick,"" Reynolds says. Clostridium perfringens is a common food-borne pathogen found in poultry, meats, and gravies, often when the food has been sitting at warm “danger zone” temperatures for a long time. Sure, it may sound like a waste but you really want to minimize the risk of exposure to food-borne pathogens, Reynolds says, especially if you’re pregnant or immunocompromised because the health risks are much more serious. And just because you aren’t sick right after the meal, that doesn’t mean you’re in the clear. “Sometimes it can take a week or so for symptoms to show up so people don’t even realize that they’ve gotten food poisoning or diarrhea from Thanksgiving because it happens in early December,” Reynolds says.
 


After you enjoy the meal you cooked (seriously, sit down and enjoy your dinner because you worked hard!), make sure all the food goes into the fridge as soon as possible. You have about two hours to refrigerate cooked food, Reynolds says, before the bacteria starts reaching dangerous levels. The CDC recommends setting your fridge to 40°F or colder, and checking it periodically after you load in the leftovers to make sure it's cold enough.""Remember, when you put the food in the fridge you’re not setting the bacteria count back to zero or removing what's already grown, you’re just stopping it from growing even more,"" Reynolds says. So the sooner you can get them in the fridge, the better. And don't forget that your pies are also cooked foods and they need to go in the fridge too. Advertisement     
 


When storing food, you want to make sure you do it correctly so the leftovers actually cool down and get below 40 degrees, which slows bacterial growth. “You’re putting a lot of hot food in the fridge on Thanksgiving, so you want to portion everything up into smaller Tupperware containers so it cools down faster,” Reynolds says. Do not just throw some Saran Wrap over the entire casserole dish or pot full of hot food and shove it directly into the fridge. “If you do this, it can take up to 24 hours for internal temperature of the food to get into a safe zone,” Reynolds says. Putting a bunch of really hot food and pans into the fridge can also raise the fridge temperature slightly, pushing it above 40 degrees Fahrenheit so all the other food is sitting at an unsafe temperature, too.
 


Leftovers are probably the best part of Thanksgiving — I mean who doesn’t love a good turkey and stuffing sandwich the next day? But you still have to be careful with leftovers because even after they go in the fridge, they can still have bacteria at levels that make you ill. “Eat your leftovers after no more than three or four days — you’ve probably taken them out of the fridge many times since Thanksgiving so they’ve probabaly tested that danger zone several times,” Reynolds says.  Advertisement     If you want your leftovers to last longer, just freeze them! They can last months this way. When you do eat them, just make sure to reheat everything properly so it reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit.

410,"“I like to speak my mind because I feel like, in the idol world, it’s very rare to find that.”","


PASADENA, California — Non-K-pop fans may not be familiar with the name Jae Park, but millions of listeners have long been infatuated with the 29-year-old idol, the lead guitarist and vocalist for K-pop quintet Day6 (here’s one of the group’s music videos — it has 45 million views). And the crowds of fans who saw him at 88rising’s Head in the Clouds festival this month certainly were excited to see him again, with the audience screaming wildly as Park made his first public performance since a quiet step back from the spotlight two years ago.
 


“WE MISSED YOU JAE,” signs read across the Rose Bowl.In a landscape as tightly controlled as the K-pop industry, Park has spent seven years in the public eye cementing a distinct personality for himself with his brazen “American openness” as a Korean celebrity. However, he hasn't always been rewarded when opening up about the effects of stardom, his mental health, and industry control.“They get tired of you questioning, they feel that's being disrespectful in Korean culture [where teachers and elders are so highly regarded],” he tells me after his first appearance onstage. “After a while of trying to reason with you, they fall back on the same go-to. ‘Why can’t I do this?’ ‘Because it's Korea.’”Disappearances from the public eye are typically deliberate and executed by K-pop idols' companies, who usually release a statement before the artist has said anything at all. But Park, the self-described “problem child” of K-pop right now, does not always stick to the plan.Park hinted at unhappiness in Instagram Lives during his ""offline period,"" with statements about ""Disney Channel filter bullshit"" and doing ""everything out of [his] own pocket."" And the legions of fans who follow him and his company, JYP Entertainment, were quick to speculate about mistreatment and possible changes to the group. Advertisement  “You know, you feel bad,” he says. “Because you’re in a group — you're not just an artist on your own. If I was, I wouldn’t give a fuck. But your actions mean your bandmates get hate as well.”But here, now, without his bandmates and under a brand-new moniker, eaJ, Park’s solo career has not yet even officially begun as he took to the most well-known main stage for Asian American music.The crowd is distinctly divided between long-term K-pop fans, and festivalgoers who are just there on a whim — a perfect illustration of the massive-yet-insular world of Korean pop music. “I don’t have any official songs out on any distribution platforms [as eaJ],” he tells the crowd during his set. “Isn’t that weird?”
 


Born in Buenos Aires and raised in Cerritos, California, Park first drew industry attention online as a YouTube cover artist.“I didn't really have the nicest time in high school. It was really hard for me to socialize and I'm not really good at social cues,” he says. “[Making covers] was one of the things that got me somewhat accepted by people. I would upload a video and people would go, ‘I saw your video, it has 300 views!’ It was just nice. To have people be nice to me.” Advertisement  In his first year at Cal State Long Beach, he was scouted to join the competition show K-pop Star and went on to sign with the top-three label JYP.“I originally went there thinking like, Oh, it’s gonna be a nice two-month vacation. I get to leave school. My mom's gonna love me because she knows JYP. Everyone loves JYP. I was like, All right, this is how I'm gonna get to go and party and have fun. It ended up being exactly the opposite. I was stuck in a 4-by-4 room, singing to a keyboard for the next four years.”
 


The training system is notoriously brutal for K-pop idols, although as Park explains, standardized across the industry.“They’re very intense, and they're all very similar,” he says. “They somehow bash it into your brain that you're not good enough. So even though we’re talking right now, I’m remembering the mistake I made onstage earlier in the right side of my head. They somehow bash that into your brain, which I don't think is totally a bad thing, but I don't think it's healthy mostly.” Advertisement  “As a trainee, you battle with other trainees in order to be the person they want. The one they call on while you’re sitting in a lobby room and they say, ‘OK, I think he's ready. I think he's ready to debut.’ So they give you opportunities, but they don't train you to be performers. Your stage presence, all of that, isn't as manufactured as people think. I've been put onstage and I've been told that I should have better presence, or I need to be better, but never how. You're always scared because they'll just cut random people. It’s a lot of fear.”Park was one of the few who made it to debut with the band Day6, marketed as a more traditional band, rather than the K-pop trademark of choreography-based groups. Yet despite the backing of a major company, and a unique positioning in the K-pop landscape, he still feels there were misconceptions around the success of the group.“I don't feel like we're as successful as people make us out to be,” he says. “But I think we were very grateful that even with the amount of success that we accomplished, we were able to do world tours and meet people that actually cherished our music.” Advertisement  
 


Money is another recurring yet evasive topic throughout Park’s stream of consciousness. He jokes, “Why are we wasting our time on hating people when we could waste our time making money, you know what I mean? I’m broke, but. That’s why my mind’s on it.”“I definitely don't have as much money as people think I do,"" he says. ""People are always like, ‘You're rich. You're rich. You're wearing Cartier glasses.’ Bro, I got these used! What are you talking about? What are you talking about, dude? People are like, ‘You wear expensive clothes.’ What clothes? These aren’t my clothes! These are the company’s clothes. People think idols are super rich. We’re not.”I ask what that means. “That’s for another conversation, until my engagements, sort of…” he trails off, but it resurfaces again later. “I'm trying to work with [a certain] producer, but I don’t have money for him, dude! OK, I’m not broke, I have life savings. And I'm prepared to spend every single last dime on this producer next year. It's kind of do or die. But I’d actually go broke if I don’t make it.” Advertisement  So being successful, which Park defined loosely as ranking among international superstars on global charts, was not something he ever felt he fully achieved in his career, although he does accept some success in that he feels the love between his fans and the band was — is — genuine.But the life of being a K-pop idol continued to wear on. “I'm 100% confident if I didn't have this career path, I wouldn’t have broken down with panic attacks. I think it's because of just constant fear of a lot of things. You should ask every idol what the first thing they think of when they wake up in the morning is.”I asked what he thought about for the past seven years.“Am I gonna be done today? Is something going to happen?"" he says. ""That's the first thing you think of. That's why idols are all over the socials. Because they're constantly checking. Is there something from 50 years ago that I did or, like, did I wrong someone in some way?” Advertisement  
 


Park speaks in terms of ""cancelable"" and ""not cancelable"" more so than ""right or wrong"" in this conversation — a viewpoint likely shaped by his idol training. “My friend is in another much, much more established group than I am, another American that went over to Korea. He's so concerned with what he says, that even when we're talking one-on-one, I see him filtering his words mentally. I feel so bad. I know that route, because I've been down it, and you lose your mind.”In early 2020, Park experienced an intense panic attack that led to his diagnosis of panic disorder, a now-publicized event that was the inspiration behind his clothing label, From Friends. Advertisement  “It was really, really hard for me to let go because the thing that I heard the most was, ‘You're in a group, you're in a group. If you fuck up, your group takes responsibility for it.’”The moment of recognizing the fragility of his mental health was certainly was a turning point, but Park still carries guilt and stress with him around his actions in his career. “I feel like I have caused more distress to my fandom than I’ve caused happiness in the past two years that I’ve been absent from the group. And my ongoing tension with the company as well hasn't been good. Because there's always speculation like this, and what is this going to do for people? It’ll stress them out. And that stresses me out. That especially stresses my fam out — my members. Day6.”Currently, Park confirms he is still a part of Day6. But, he says, “I believe that it is in the best interest of everyone, that for the moment, I do take a leave. Not just for my members, but for my fandom and for me as well. I'm not gonna lie and sit here like, ‘Oh, yeah, this is like this is all for my members or my fans.’ I'm sorry to break it to you. But all your idols who tell you that this is all for you? They lie. Because everyone at the end of the day, you have to take care of yourself. So this is for me, as well as my members.”
 


In his absence, his company JYP Entertainment has faced blame for his hiatus, particularly the company’s CEO, Park Jin-Young (also known as JYP), who is a mainstay celebrity in the Korean pop culture zeitgeist. It wouldn’t be the first time the company was in the hot seat, including fans’ assertions of mistreatment when band Got7 left the company earlier this year and its long-standing relationship with R. Kelly. But Park remains in defense of Jin-Young Park.“It's a shame that people get mad that I support him. People get really upset, but they're not understanding that things that happen to groups are not on him. I'm sorry to break your dreams, but even he gets his own songs rejected at the company. So you're telling me that your idol didn't get promotions the way they should have? Or they didn't come back the way you wanted? That's probably not on him. I mean, keep them accountable. Do your thing, pop off, but it's not the end of the story. You're literally throwing spears and stones at the messenger. At who? The person who's the head of an entity? He doesn't control things.”Despite his hiatus from Day6, Park says he’s happier outside of the idol industry control, making independent music. He’ll always be a part of Day6, he assured fans on another livestream, but now, “I'm much happier this way. Making my own decisions. I'm happier being able to talk to you like this rather than, ‘It's great, idol life is really good. I love being onstage. I love everything.’ I like to speak my mind because I feel like, in the idol world, it's very rare to find that. I get shit on, but it's cool. I'm OK with that.” Advertisement  “I have never once branded myself as an idol,"" he says. ""I told people straight off my first Live. I cuss a lot. I say these things. I have opinions. I'm not God and I'm not Jesus. I sin so I have a lot of shortcomings. I misunderstand things. I have a temper. And I will sincerely apologize every time and I guess it's funny because I mean, I'm the guy that says sorry, like every other day, but I'm genuinely sorry because I didn't know and I didn't want to offend people.”
 


Performing at Head in the Clouds was a homecoming for Park, with new fans and returning followers mixed among each other in the audience. He was smiling from “here to here,” he says, pointing at his ears and grinning. 88rising is one of the most prominent Asian American music companies, and Park says he was truly humbled and excited to be a part of it, particularly as someone without an established career in the West. Advertisement     While the future remains open for Park’s new leaf, he remains positive about the changes in the K-pop industry around mental health. “I've seen a lot of companies hire psychologists or hire therapists and ask people to talk to someone if they need it. Because they're very open about mental health now. So Korea is slowly starting to move to that; it's cool they’re opening up about it.”“The system is different,"" Park says. ""I understand why they have to have some control. In Korea, you're taken as not an artist, but a trainee to become an artist — someone that shows they have the capabilities and the talents to be some of that statute. In America, in order to become an artist, you start as an artist. You come with your own music. You have your own flavor. In Korea, they give that to you. There are very few cases in which they have their own color.”The next day when we see each other, I ask if he has any advice for young Asian creatives. “Don’t be creative,” he says. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry! That was really fucked up.” Advertisement

411,“The whole goal with Indigenous Photograph is to show that there’s not one way to be Native.”,"


Unity about anything is rare these days in the United States, but there is a remarkable show of consensus among Native American people about what issues are most important to them. A survey of more than 6,000 Native citizens from over 400 tribes around the country was conducted by the nonprofit IllumiNative. The results, which were published in October 2020, are now visualized in an online exhibition, The Indigenous Futures Storytelling Project, that highlights mental health, violence against women, loss of language and cultural practices, protection of the land, and care for older adults. Advertisement  ""It was one of the craziest things, no matter how we slice the data, whether it's looking at geography, age, gender, the same five or so priorities kept coming up in the same way for all of these groups,"" said Leah Salgado, the chief impact officer of IllumiNative.They partnered with Indigenous Photograph, a collective of primarily Native American photographers, to curate and commission photos that would bring these issues to life in a meaningful way. Ultimately, eight projects were selected for inclusion, with at least one per subject.""The whole goal with Indigenous Photograph is to show that there's not one way to be Native. This project was another way that we were able to do that,"" said Tailyr Irvine, one of the cofounders of Indigenous Photograph who helped with the curation. ""It was intentional to include work from as many different parts of the country as we could."" Advertisement  The broad inclusion within the online show helps visualize these issues more cohesively and serves to connect otherwise distant tribes. Some of the issues, such as violence against women and mental health, are of national social importance, although they particularly impact Native American people. Despite the heaviness of the topic, Irvine sidesteps the usual narrative that is associated with missing women by including a project of hers on boxing that provides a welcome solution-oriented approach that is apparent throughout the exhibition. Another example would be Kalen Goodluck's images of seedkeeping, which show how the past directly affects the future.
 


While Native Americans make up just under 3% of the overall US population according to recent census data, there has been growing awareness over the past several years of the present challenges they face — and how those challenges are often intertwined with the wider population.The coronavirus pandemic hit reservations particularly hard, and highlighted a stark disparity as residents often lack access to healthcare or running water. Land recognition has become a more commonplace practice, and the Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that a significant portion of Oklahoma was actually Native American land, upending long-standing legal assumptions. Native Americans also played a crucial role in swing states during the 2020 election, including Arizona and Wisconsin. Despite this, Native Americans are often overlooked in data collection, making it hard to track trends.""I think a lot of people have had a misconception that Native people are too small a population to make any difference, or that we're a politically unengaged group, and the Indigenous Futures exhibition is in direct contradiction to all of these negative narratives that people have about Native people [have] about the democratic process,"" Salgado said. Advertisement  She pointed out that Illuminative was able to reach such a large range of people by working with local researchers and organizers to overcome common obstacles, such as lack of access to broadband internet or regular mail services. They intend to conduct regular surveys in the coming years to counteract the dearth of representation.The exhibition is intended to be used as a starting resource, as the organizers hope that the issues will become outdated over time. They encourage people from all backgrounds to familiarize themselves with not only these issues, but the creative approaches being taken to solve them and to counteract the often negative narratives around Native Americans.""The fun part about this work is that it's so expressive and I think it makes it different and interesting, and it makes people want to read more and want to look into more,"" Irvine said.

412,"The jury found the white nationalists violated Virginia state laws, but they could not reach a verdict on federal conspiracy charges.","


CHARLOTTESVILLE, Virginia — A jury found a group of the most notorious white supremacist leaders and organizations in the United States violated state civil rights laws by conspiring to commit racially motivated violence at the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally — and ordered them to pay more than $25 million in damages to their victims.The 11 jurors came to the decision on Tuesday after a four-week civil trial that was punctuated with emotional victim testimony, descriptions of horrific violence, and bizarre outbursts that sometimes sounded more like Nazi propaganda than courtroom dialogue. Advertisement     The rally left dozens wounded and one anti-racism activist dead.The jury was not able to reach a unanimous decision on federal conspiracy charges, however.Roberta Kaplan, co–lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said after the verdict was read that her team plans to refile the federal claims against the defendants. She said she believes the jury was eager to get home before the Thanksgiving holiday and that a new jury would rule in her clients' favor in the federal conspiracy charges.“We think the facts were established. We think that the finding of liability in count 3 showed a conspiracy,” she told reporters outside the courthouse. Kaplan let out a shout of “Yes!” as she stepped into her black SUV. Advertisement     The verdict in the landmark trial comes amid a resurgence of far-right domestic violent extremism and the mainstreaming of these ideologies, ushered in by Donald Trump. The former president’s hyperpolarizing populism, nationalism, and racist rhetoric has enabled his followers — and some elected Republicans — to endorse violence, including an attack on the US Capitol in January. For years, the legal system has struggled to hold these far-right extremists accountable for their actions. President Joe Biden, who said it was the racial violence in Charlottesville that convinced him to run against Trump, has made combatting far-right domestic violent extremism a top priority of his administration.Amy Spitalnick, the executive director of Integrity First for America, the civil rights nonprofit that brought the case against the defendants on behalf of nine victims of their white supremacist violence, said even the verdict is a victory against white supremacy.“This case has sent a clear message: Violent hate won’t go unanswered. There will be accountability,” Spitalnick told BuzzFeed News after the verdict was announced. “Over the court of this trial, our plaintiffs presented overwhelming evidence that the violence was no accident. We’re heartened that the jury agreed.”Matthew Parrott, who along with his neo-Nazi group, the Traditionalist Worker Party, was a defendant in the case, told BuzzFeed News he was unhappy with the verdict. ""I think it sets a disappointing precedent for our civil liberties,"" he said. ""The jurors have given us a middle finger.""Parrott also conceded that he believed the verdict would impact how he and the other defendants go about their white supremacist activity. ""We can’t show our face in public again,"" he said. ""If we do, we’d have to spend the next five years fighting another conspiracy charge in court.""
 


Unlike a criminal trial, in which the jury must find guilt “beyond a reasonable doubt,” in this case, US District Court Judge Norman Moon told jurors Wednesday ahead of closing argument that they needed only to find that there is a “preponderance of evidence,” or a 50.1% possibility of the plaintiffs’ claim being true. Advertisement     The plaintiffs, backed by the civil rights nonprofit Integrity First for America on behalf of nine victims of that violence, tried to use the 150-year-old Ku Klux Klan Act to hold the defendants behind the rally accountable for what they claimed was a conspiracy to commit racially motivated violence. The defendants, according to the plaintiffs’ complaint, planned in advance “to intimidate, harass, incite, and cause violence to people based on their race, religion, ethnicity, and sexual orientation.”The KKK Act of 1871 was historically key in taking down the white supremacist group as it swept across the Southern US after the Civil War. The statute allows the victims of racially motivated violence to sue when there’s a conspiracy to commit that violence. In an interview before the start of the trial in October, Kaplan told BuzzFeed News the KKK Act is seeing a “renaissance of sorts.” The law is currently being used in two cases against former president Donald Trump and his allies in relation to the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol, including one brought by Black Capitol Police officers and another by members of Congress.The “Unite the Right” rally descended on Charlottesville on Aug. 11 and 12, 2017. It involved hundreds of alt-right figures, neo-Nazis, and other white supremacists who marched with torches and shields and other weaponry through the University of Virginia grounds and clashed with anti-racist counterprotesters at a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Organizers claimed the rally was meant to protest the planned removal of the monument to Confederate General Robert E. Lee, but in reality, it was a show of force by the white nationalist movement.The violence reached a bloody crescendo on the rally’s second day when neo-Nazi James Fields rammed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters as they marched down a narrow street. At least 19 people were badly injured, including several plaintiffs in the lawsuit, and activist Heather Heyer was killed. Fields, one of the defendants, previously pleaded guilty to murdering Heyer and is serving a life sentence in prison.Heyer's mother, Susan Bro, told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday that she was grateful the jury had recognized the guilt of the larger group of ""Unite the Right"" organizers.""The case brought a lot of information about the planning of [Unite the Right] to light,"" she said. ""In addition to bringing these organizations and individuals to account, it sends a message to others that there are consequences to putting hate speech into action."" Advertisement     
 


Before the trial began, the court handed down default judgments against seven of the defendants who refused to participate in the lawsuit and trial. The court will decide the damages they must pay to the plaintiffs at a later date.But until Tuesday’s verdict, no other organizer or participant besides Fields had been held accountable for the violence that weekend by a jury of their peers.The plaintiffs presented a mountain of digital evidence, including secret chat logs and social media posts, aiming to show the defendants had planned the violence at the rally in advance in hopes of stoking a “race war” and “celebrated” their brutality afterward.The defendants struggled to rebut the claims against them, arguing that while they are racists and harbor views that most people find abhorrent, the violence occurred as a result of them fighting off attacks from left-wing “antifa” and “commie” counterprotesters. The defendants also tried to distance themselves from one another, in some cases claiming they had only met during the rally.Spitalnick of IFA said she hopes the decision will bankrupt and dismantle violent hate groups and deter and prevent neo-Nazis and others like them from planning and committing racially motivated violence in the future.To some extent, the trial itself already did that; Richard Spencer, the former alt-right leader, has said the lawsuit had been “financially crippling.” (He said in a tweet Tuesday that he'll appeal.) Many of his codefendants have also faced legal trouble, been kicked off of mainstream social media platforms, and been banned from raising money on crowdfunding websites in the four years since the lawsuit was filed.Spitalnick told BuzzFeed News that the plaintiffs were pleased with the verdict. In a statement, April Muñiz, Chelsea Alvarado, Devin Willis, Elizabeth Sines, Marcus Martin, Marissa Blair, Natalie Romero, Reverend Seth Wispelwey, and Thomas Baker said it had been a long four years since they first brought their case. Advertisement     ""Today, we can celebrate the jury’s verdict finally holding defendants like [Jason Kessler, Richard Spencer and Christopher Cantwell] accountable for what they did to us and to everyone else in the Charlottesville community who stood up against hate in August 2017,"" the plaintiffs said. ""Our single greatest hope is that today’s verdict will encourage others to feel safer raising our collective voices in the future to speak up for human dignity and against white supremacy.”
 


On the witness stand, they recounted what for them was the worst day of their lives.As a photo of blood streaming down her battered face was shown in the courtroom and memories came flooding back, Romero choked up and her voice cracked. Through tears, she described the moments before the image was taken, when a Dodge Challenger driven by Fields rammed into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators, killing Heyer and injuring dozens of other people.“I get hit and the next thing I know is just darkness and hearing a long beep and thumps,” Romero, 24, testified.She described it like a scene from a war movie when a soldier is blown up by an explosion and the screen flashes before going dark.“I couldn't see too much, but I just felt [blood] dripping and it's warm on my face,” she said. “I thought I was about to die.”Blair described in heart-wrenching testimony how her then-fiancé Martin pushed her out of the way of Fields' car. Martin, however, wasn’t so lucky. The car struck him, shattering his leg and sending him flying into the air. Advertisement     “I was confused. I was scared. I was worried about all the people that were there,” Blair told the court. “It was a complete terror scene. It was blood everywhere. I was terrified.”The days, weeks, and months after “Unite the Right” was also difficult for the plaintiffs, they said.
 


Blair and Romero, among others, discussed the personal and psychological effects they had suffered. Romero said she has had recurring nightmares. Blair, who married Martin months after the car attack, said her marriage ultimately failed because of the stress it had created between the two of them.Their attorneys spent hours drilling their aggressors on the witness stand and using their own words against them. In one particularly damning direct examination of defendant and primary “Unite the Right” planner Jason Kessler, the plaintiffs’ counsel read from a May 2017 post he wrote on Discord.“I think we need to have a battle of Berkeley situation in Charlottesville and fight this shit out,” Kessler wrote. “Can you guys conceal carry? I don’t want to scare antifa off from throwing the first punch. Big scary guns...will keep Antifa away. I want them to start something. Lots of armed military vets in attendance so we aren’t going to be lacking for firepower.”Kessler and his codefendants made the case that while they are vile racists their words and actions did not amount to a violent conspiracy. But they lacked a cohesive strategy and more often than not their arguments were incoherent and hard to follow. Advertisement     However, cognizant of the fact that audio of the trial was available to the public in real time and that it would be memorialized through court transcripts for anyone to read in the future, they seized the moment to spread their racist and hate-filled agendas and air personal grievances.Neo-Nazi Christopher Cantwell, currently serving a prison sentence for threatening the wife of another neo-Nazi in an unrelated case, used racist slurs in both his opening statement and closing arguments and promoted his podcast on several occasions. While questioning witnesses, he spent much of his time trying to paint the plaintiffs as members of “antifa” and spreading propaganda and unfounded conspiracy theories about “commies.”
 


Spencer spoke at length about his desire to see an all-white “ethno-state” created and read snippets from a racist manifesto he had written. And in his closing argument, he compared himself to Jesus, “a radical, an extremist,” and a “scapegoat,” prompting Moon to cut him off. “You can’t cut me off for using poetry!” Spencer snapped back.That those two defendants also served as their own counsel made for surreal and often perplexing moments. During one cross-examination, Cantwell and defendant and neo-Nazi Matthew Heimbach discussed their adoration for Adolf Hitler and denied there was a Holocaust.“What’s your favorite Holocaust joke?” Cantwell asked Heimbach.“My favorite?” Heimbach replied, chuckling before the judge cut them off.In another, Spencer used his cross-examination of Kessler to criticize him and try to put distance between the two of them.“When did you determine I was a sociopathic narcissist?” Spencer asked. Kessler lashed out at him, saying, “you were just despicable to everyone you came into contact with"" and describing Spencer as having the demeanor of a “serial killer.” Advertisement     The court also heard testimony from experts who spoke about how the defendants had couched their racism and violent intentions in jokes and memes. Deborah Lipstadt, a historian and an expert on the Holocaust, gave the jury a crash course on the matter.Near the end of the trial, Cantwell and Spencer made a motion for Moon to dismiss the case, arguing that the plaintiffs had not presented any evidence to prove they were part of a conspiracy to commit racially motivated violence at “Unite the Right.”Moon quickly dismissed their motions.“You have a misunderstanding, I’m afraid, of what conspiracy is,” Moon said. He read back to them several messages exchanged during the planning of the rally that he said could show a conspiracy under federal law.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Karen Dunn, co-lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said not getting a verdict on the federal conspiracy counts was no less of a victory.“Our goal was to come here and to prove a conspiracy to do racially motivated violence as to each and every defendant and to get damages awards, compensatory and punitive, and we did all those things,” she said.

413,"For Kyle Rittenhouse, a claim of self-defense led to an acquittal. Will the same be true for a young Black man who killed a white teen in Georgia?","


Around 1 a.m. on June 14, 2020, 21-year-old Marc Wilson, who is Black, and his 21-year-old girlfriend, Emma Rigdon, who is white, left a Taco Bell in Statesboro, Georgia. At a stoplight, they pulled up next to a pickup truck. Wilson’s lawyers say that at least one of the white teenagers inside the truck shouted the n-word and “your lives don’t matter.”Wilson later told police that the teenagers in the pickup truck swerved in front of him, tried to knock his sedan off the highway, and threw an object that impacted the car with a loud sound that made him think they might be shooting at him. Wilson pulled out a gun and fired out his window at the truck. The bullet struck and killed 17-year-old Haley Hutcheson, who was sitting in the pickup’s backseat. Advertisement     Prosecutors charged him with felony murder and aggravated assault, which carry a maximum sentence of life in prison and the possibility of the death penalty. Wilson claimed self-defense.“Me and my girlfriend were very scared that night,” Wilson told police later that week, according to a detective’s testimony. “Everything going on in this country, I’m not going to let me and my girl get run off the road.”Wilson was denied bail because Ogeechee Judicial Circuit Court Judge Michael Muldrew concluded that he “poses a significant threat” to the community. He remained in jail two months later when a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, shot and injured Jacob Blake, a Black 29-year-old, sparking protests in that city that drew armed counterprotesters and Kyle Rittenhouse, a white 17-year-old who fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26. Rittenhouse, who made a $2 million bond with the help of donations from supporters, claimed self-defense, testifying that he feared for his life following a confrontation with three men who chased him, hit him with a skateboard, and tried to kick him. On Friday, a jury acquitted him of all charges.Wilson’s case, which is scheduled to go to trial in early 2022, presents a similar legal defense: A young person says he fired his gun at a group that threatened his safety.But in a justice system that has historically treated Black defendants more harshly than white ones, Wilson’s case raises the question of whether a young Black man’s self-defense claim will carry the same weight as those made by other recent high-profile defendants. Advertisement     
 


Self-defense laws, including the castle doctrine and “stand your ground” provisions, offer legal justification to kill people who pose a physical threat. Castle doctrine is based on the idea that a person has a right to defend their home, or castle, if they are in imminent danger. In 1994, Utah passed a law that extended that right to self-defense to any place a person has a legal right to be. Florida followed in 2005. To date, 34 states have similar laws in place. Georgia’s states that a person is justified in using force if “he or she reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily injury.” The white men who followed and fatally shot Ahmaud Arbery, a Black 25-year-old, while he was jogging near their neighborhood in Glynn County, Georgia, last year have also claimed self-defense and are currently on trial for charges that include murder.Who is protected by such laws often depends on race, say the laws’ critics. In 2020, the United States Commission on Civil Rights released a study of racial disparities in Florida’s Stand Your Ground law, finding that homicides in which the shooter is white and the victim is Black were ruled to be justified 11.2% of the time, compared to just 1.2% of the time when the shooter is Black and the victim is white.“What we do know, and what we cannot ignore, is that the same racial biases that have permeated our criminal justice system cannot be separate from this issue,” the commission concluded.Rittenhouse was acquitted because he fired at people who he said attacked him — even though he had violated a local curfew order and, according to prosecutors, pointed his assault rifle at the men before they pursued him. Advertisement     George Zimmerman was acquitted in 2013 because he was in a physical struggle with Trayvon Martin, a Black 17-year-old who was walking home — even though Zimmerman initiated the encounter against the orders of the 911 dispatch operator he'd called to report that a person he deemed suspicious was passing through his neighborhood.Adam Kind faced no charges for fatally shooting Bo Morrison, a Black 20-year-old hiding on his porch in Wisconsin after police broke up a party at a neighboring home in 2012 — even though officers were still on the block, responding to his complaint about the loud music next door.But for some Black defendants in recent years, evidence of self-defense has not been enough to avoid a conviction.After fatally shooting a Georgia construction contractor who had threatened his son with a knife in 2005, John McNeil was convicted on murder charges and sentenced to life in prison. He was released in 2013 after prosecutors lowered the charge to voluntary manslaughter.John White was convicted of manslaughter for the 2006 fatal shooting of a teenager who was part of a group of young white people yelling racial slurs and threatening White’s son in the driveway of his home in Long Island, New York. White was pardoned after spending five months in prison.
 


Critics of looser self-defense laws argue that easier access to guns coupled with more leeway to use them make for a deadly combination.“Tensions are high, gun laws are lax, and there is this really permissive environment for this kind of confrontation,” said Nick Suplina, managing director for law and policy at Everytown, a gun safety advocacy group, speaking specifically about the Rittenhouse case. “We have political polarization in this country and there are people itching for a fight.” Advertisement     Wilson’s case marks another measure of self-defense laws in America and who those laws protect.After Hutcheson was shot, the teens in the pickup truck drove to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead.The four teens — 18-year-olds Mason Glisson, Luke Conley, and Ashton DeLoach, and a 16-year-old girl — told police a similar story: They were at a stoplight beside a sedan, and when the light turned green and they drove off, the sedan's driver opened fire on them, according to court documents. Though they admitted to drinking while on the road, they were not breathalyzed.When officers asked if they had any idea why someone would shoot at them, they said they didn’t know. But all four said that they believed that one of the people in the sedan was a classmate named Marijane — DeLoach said he was “1,000% sure” it was her, according to police records. They had encountered Marijane, who is white, earlier that night in a convenience store with her boyfriend, who is Black.The 16-year-old girl in the truck testified that when the truck passed the sedan at an intersection, Conley and DeLoach stuck their hands and head out the window, though she said she didn’t know if they said anything. She said she thought they were waving at the person they assumed — mistakenly, it turned out — to be Marijane.In one of the police reports, Detective Dustin Cross wrote that Conley ""was seen yelling out of a window of the victim vehicle just prior to the shooting.""In his interviews with police, Conley gave conflicting statements about who he thought was in the sedan and was charged with obstruction of justice and arrested — that case remains pending.The morning after the shooting, the Statesboro Police Department issued a press release seeking information about it. Later, they received a call from a woman who said her friend Emma Rigdon had told her about an incident that might be related: the woman conveyed that Rigdon told her the shooting had come after the teens in the truck “started using racial slurs and racial signs,” according to the police report.The next day, officers met with Rigdon. Wilson, who happened to call her while she was speaking to police, joined the conversation by speakerphone.Rigdon said that when the couple pulled up at the intersection outside the Taco Bell, Wilson told her that the guys in the truck beside them were saying the n-word to him. She herself didn’t hear them, she said, because she had been distracted by her puppy in her lap. Advertisement     But after the light turned green, the truck swerved in front of them, and two boys were leaning out the windows shouting at them, she and Wilson said. “A truck full of — all I saw were white males — white males driving their car at me and are flipping me off and yelling racial slurs,” Wilson said to police.“With everything going on right now,” Rigdon told police, referring to the 2020 racial justice protests across the nation, Wilson “honestly thought that they were trying to run him off the road, and I was like, ‘Marc, I’m scared.’”“It’s in the middle of the night,” Rigdon testified at a hearing. “There’s no lights on that road. I didn’t really know what was gonna happen.”An embankment lay beside the two-lane road, and Wilson told police he veered close enough to hear the rumble strips along the edge of the pavement. He said he fired two or three “warning shots” below the truck, which caused the truck's driver, Glisson, to slow down — DeLoach recounted the same detail in his testimony, saying ""it looked like he was shooting at the ground at first.""Then the truck accelerated, and Wilson heard a “loud boom,” he said. He said he thought the truck had either rammed his car or the teens had returned fire. Police suspect the sound may have been from a thrown beer — officers found beer cans by the side of the road matching the brand the teens were drinking that night.“I had no clue what hit me,” Wilson told police, according to Detective Travis Kreun’s testimony. “I thought that they were shooting at me.”Wilson fired again, then turned at the next intersection.The day after the call with police, Wilson turned himself in.In court, Wilson’s lawyers have argued that his actions meet the standard of the state’s self-defense law, which categorizes a person’s vehicle as a dwelling where they have “the right to stand his or her ground and use force.”The evidence “shows that Wilson’s vehicle was being attacked by the truck” and “shows the racial animus exhibited” by the teens in the truck, defense attorneys wrote in a brief to the court. “Wilson attempted to ignore the truck’s initial encroachment of his vehicle lane of travel. However, the truck continued in its violently aggressive advancement causing Wilson to fear for his life and the safety of his passenger.” Advertisement     
 


The defense team has cited America’s history of racist violence against Black people as further explanation for the fear Wilson may have felt.“My worst nightmare as a Black man in this country is to be on a deserted road with a truckload of white, drunk men,” defense lawyer Francys Johnson said in court. “There are bodies that’s strewn through the history of this country that say that that’s a reasonable fear for a number of people.”Johnson noted the 1998 killing of James Byrd Jr., who was dragged from the back of a pickup truck in Texas; three white men were convicted of murder, two of them sentenced to death. In another incident, in 2011, a pickup truck full of white teens fatally struck James Anderson in a parking lot in Mississippi; the driver was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.At a moment when racial tensions were simmering across the country, Wilson's case sparked an online backlash against both him and the teens. Hutcheson’s aunt, Heather Ernst, said in court that her family has received threats on social media, including anonymous comments about desecrating Hutcheson’s grave. In a brief to the court, Wilson’s attorney Mawuli Davis identified a man in a “white heritage” Facebook group who made a “racially motivated threat” against Wilson and attended at least one court hearing.Prosecutors have argued that Wilson acted unreasonably and challenged the allegation that the white teens carried racist beliefs. In her questioning of DeLoach at a hearing, Assistant District Attorney Daphne Totten asked, “Do you have any Black friends?” And after he replied that a Black friend lived with him for some time, Totten said, “So would it be fair to say you don’t have any issues with Black people?” Advertisement     In his testimony, DeLoach recalled an incident from earlier that night: After a brief, friendly interaction with a middle-aged Black man in a convenience store parking lot, Conley said to the man “Black Lives Matter” in a tone that indicated he “was just saying it to be funny” and “trying to be a little smart aleck,” DeLoach said. “And I kind of told him to shut up about it.”When Conley took the stand during a preliminary hearing and Wilson’s defense attorney asked if he had uttered racial slurs that night, including n-word lover, he exercised his Fifth Amendment right, declining to answer any questions.In Glisson’s testimony, he said that he and his friends sometimes used the n-word in “a joking matter.” “I don’t mean nothing by it,” DeLoach said, noting that he has “a lot of Black friends.” “I’m not racist at all.”Totten has argued that Wilson acted out of anger more than self-defense. On that basis, Totten opposed setting a bail amount for Wilson, even though he had no criminal record.“We believe if a person is inclined to act like that because of words or hand gestures there’s no telling what he might do if granted a bond,” she said in court.Judge Muldrew agreed.“Due to the fact that Mr. Wilson’s anger appears to have overtaken him when he had contact with the persons in the truck,” Muldrew ruled, “the court finds that the defendant poses a significant threat to the persons in the community and bond will be denied.”Wilson remains in jail in Bulloch County as he awaits trial. ●

414,"Here’s how COVID pills from Merck and Pfizer work, and how and when you might be able to take them once they become available.","


Even though there’s now a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine for people 5 and older, treatments are still desperately needed for the millions of people who continue to get sick.One major goal has been to have an effective COVID treatment that’s as easy as taking a pill. Now, finally, a new oral medication for COVID-19 may be inching closer to emergency use authorization, although experts say it has shortcomings. Advertisement     On Nov. 30, an FDA advisory panel voted 13–10 to give Merck an emergency use authorization for a COVID pill called molnupiravir. (A second antiviral pill, Paxlovid, will go before the FDA for evaluation soon.)The panel’s narrow vote of approval reflected their concern about molnupiravir's relatively modest benefit and potential safety issues.Based on animal studies, molnupiravir isn’t recommended for people who are pregnant because there is a potential risk of fetal malformations, particularly of the bones and cartilage.If the FDA follows the advice of its panel, which it usually does, it means doctors may be able to prescribe the drug.The panel recommended it for non-pregnant adults with mild-to-moderate COVID symptoms who are at high risk of hospitalization or death.“This was clearly a very difficult decision,” said Dr. Michael Green, a professor of pediatrics, surgery, and clinical and translational science at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.Green, who voted for emergency use authorization, said he might consider using the drug in unvaccinated COVID patients with multiple risk factors.“Should an alternative oral agent become available that had a better safety profile and equal to or better efficacy profile, the agency might reconsider its authorization,” he said.Pfizer has also submitted a request to the FDA for emergency use authorization for its own antiviral pill, marketed under the brand name Paxlovid, which may become available in the near future.Clinical trials for the two medications purport to show a 30% to 89% reduction in the risk of being hospitalized or dying due to COVID if taken soon after symptoms start.These pills could help protect against hospitalization and death due to the respiratory virus, if the real-world results are as good as the clinical trials (they aren’t always).However, experts agree that these medications should not take the place of vaccination. Vaccines are a highly safe and effective way for children 5 and older and adults, including people who are pregnant, to avoid infections in the first place. Advertisement     More than 3 billion people around the world have now been safely vaccinated, while oral antivirals continue to be studied.Since the start of the pandemic, experts have been desperately searching for effective treatments for COVID. Some that initially looked promising, or at least got a lot of attention, have turned out to be failures (see ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine).Others — like the currently available monoclonal antibody treatments and the antiviral drug remdesivir (sold as Veklury) — are effective under specific circumstances. However, they have to be given via intravenous infusion or injection by a healthcare worker, usually in a hospital.“They were not things that were widely available to the general public,” said Dr. Tim Sheahan, a virologist at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health who did preclinical work on both molnupiravir and remdesivir. “So I think that’s why these oral antivirals are getting a lot of attention.”The antiviral medications will be available by prescription at your local pharmacy, and “everybody knows how to swallow a pill,” he said.Here’s what else you should know about these new treatments for COVID.They look effective in clinical trials.Both antiviral pills look promising when it comes to fighting COVID. Although medications don’t always perform as well in the real world as they do in clinical trials, both studies were stopped early because the benefit seemed clear.A clinical trial of molnupiravir that was supposed to include 1,500 people was stopped early because there was a 50% reduction in the risk of hospitalization or death in people taking the drug versus placebo. However, additional analysis of the second half of the trial found that the efficacy was actually lower, or about a 30% risk reduction.Overall, about 9.7% of people taking the placebo were hospitalized or died according to a full analysis of the results, compared with 6.8% of those taking molnupiravir.There was one death in the molnupiravir group (less than 1% of the group), and nine deaths in the placebo group (about 1.3% of the group).In a clinical trial of Paxlovid, the drug reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 89%. In that study, about 3,000 people with mild to moderate symptoms and at least one risk factor for developing severe illness were supposed to take the drug or a placebo, but the study was halted early because it was so clearly effective. Advertisement     Overall, there were no deaths in the treatment group and 10 deaths in the placebo group.The drugs work in different ways.There are three basic ways drugs can interfere with the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to hijack the cells in your body and churn out more of the virus.Molnupirivir and remdesivir are polymerase or RNA replicase inhibitors, which stop the cell from creating viral genetic code, Sheahan said. ​​Molnupiravir causes errors in the viral genome that impair its ability to replicate.“If you stop the virus from making viral RNA, it’s really bad for the virus,” Sheahan said. “It’s an essential part of virus replication — if you can’t make new RNA, you can’t make offspring or progeny virus.”Paxlovid is a combination of two protease inhibitors, a new one called PF-07321332, combined with an older protease inhibitor called ritonavir. They interrupt protease, an enzyme important for viral replication. “Protease inhibitors stop the replication machine from even forming,” Sheahan said.The third type of drug, entry inhibitors, stops the virus from attaching to cells in your body in the first place, similar to the way monoclonal antibodies block the virus, Sheahan said.“I think the other two classes of drugs will have a bigger impact than an entry inhibitor, but putting them all together, maybe that would be fine,” he said.
 


It’s a lot of pills, taken over a five-day period.Although both drugs come in pill form, molnupiravir is a capsule, and Paxlovid doses include two different tablets. (What’s the difference? In general, tablets can be cut in half, capsules cannot.)For molnupiravir, the clinical trial involved taking four capsules twice a day for five days, or a total of 40 capsules.In the clinical trial of Paxlovid, patients took the drug every 12 hours for five days. That included four tablets of PF-07321332 and two ritonavir tablets daily, for a total of 30 pills.Ritonavir is taken “at a low dose to help slow the metabolism, or breakdown, of PF-07321332 in order for it to remain active in the body for longer periods of time at higher concentrations to help combat the virus,” a Pfizer spokesperson said in an email. Advertisement     You take them within three to five days of the onset of symptoms.Like other antivirals such as Tamiflu for influenza, the sooner you start taking them the more effective they will be in preventing you from getting seriously ill.“These kinds of drugs do their best work if taken as early as possible after the onset of symptoms,” Sheahan said.In both clinical trials, the volunteers had mild to moderate COVID symptoms, tested positive for the virus, and had at least one risk factor that increased their chance of developing severe symptoms that could lead to hospitalization or death.For example, in the clinical trial of molnupiravir, about 13% of people were over age 60, 76% had obesity, 13% had diabetes, and 10% had a serious heart condition.The volunteers started taking the medication within three to five days of when symptoms started. None of the study participants were in the hospital or severely ill when they started taking the drugs.“Their ability to shorten the duration of your disease and prevent you from going to the hospital, and prevent you from dying, will decrease over time,” Sheahan said.Molnupiravir is not recommended for people who are pregnantAnimal studies suggest the drug may be harmful to developing fetuses, including having an impact on bone and cartilage growth. It’s possible the drug could also affect bone growth in children.While research is ongoing, for now the FDA will likely only give an emergency use authorization for people who are 18 or older.The drug “may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant individuals,” said Mark Seaton, a research officer in pharmacology and toxicology for infectious diseases at the FDA.People with mild to moderate COVID who can become pregnant may need to use a reliable form of birth control while taking the drug and for four days after the final dose.To make sure there’s no chance of fetal exposure, a pregnancy test may also be recommended before starting the treatment.That said, the FDA may leave it open to doctors to make a decision to treat some pregnant people with COVID, for example, if there are cases where the benefits of molnupiravir seem to outweigh the risk. Advertisement     “For pregnancy, I would only use it if there is no alternative therapy available and I don’t think I would use it in the first trimester,” Green said.The side effects seem to be relatively low.In both clinical trials, the side effects in the treatment group were similar to those in the placebo group.The FDA still has to make a decision as to who should take the pills and when. It’s a good idea to follow those recommendations when they are made. For example, they might be approved only if you test positive for COVID and are at high risk of complications. In that case, you should avoid taking them “just in case” or as a preventive measure.For any drug, it’s important to make sure any benefits outweigh the risks, said Dr. Waleed Javaid, an epidemiologist and director of Infection Prevention and Control at Mount Sinai Downtown.They should be widely available once approved.If the drugs get the go-ahead from the FDA, the companies say they will produce millions of doses.Merck announced it is making 10 million courses of the drug by the end of 2021, and the US has already agreed to buy 3.1 million of them for about $2.2 billion.""The US government also has the ability to purchase more than 2 million additional courses through further options that remain in the contract,"" according to a Merck spokesperson.The US plans to buy 10 million courses of Paxlovid from Pfizer at a cost of $5.3 billion, according to a deal announced in November.While it’s not yet clear how much the drugs will cost to the average consumer (or their health insurance plan, if they have one), the US government is paying around $700 per course for molnupiravir, and $530 per course for Paxlovid.A Merck spokesperson said that in the US, ""the government will make molnupiravir available for free to patients, and we believe it will be available at little to no cost for most other countries that have a supply agreement with our company.""Merck signed an agreement in October with a nonprofit that would allow companies in more than 100 countries, mostly in Asia and Africa, to license molnupiravir. In April, the company signed licensing agreements with manufacturers in India to produce generic molnupiravir. Advertisement     Pfizer has struck a similar deal, allowing a United Nations–backed nonprofit to sublicense the drug, making it available in 95 countries.That means millions of people in low- or middle-income countries may be able to get the drugs at a much lower cost.Some day, a cocktail of drugs might be used to fight COVID.People with other viral infections like HIV and hepatitis C are treated with a variety of antiviral medications, Sheahan said.Having multiple drugs that use different mechanisms to stop SARS-CoV-2 could be useful in that way, although much more research is needed to demonstrate that that is true.“Two drugs that act in different ways if used together may not only be additive but it could be synergistic in its ability to diminish replication, but it also will create an environment that’s way less likely to generate resistance than monotherapy,” Sheahan said.You shouldn’t skip vaccines because these are available — seriously.All the experts we talked to were in strong agreement. These pills are not an excuse to skip vaccinations.“Although antivirals are promising, we must be sure to get our population vaccinated,” Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a press briefing in November. “Antivirals, as good as they are, are not our first line of defense against COVID-19.”While a reduction in the risk of hospitalization is good, the way you get a 100% decrease in the risk of hospitalization is to not get infected in the first place, Fauci said.“Drugs like these are very encouraging, they are very helpful, but these will not be the answer,” Javaid said. “Get vaccinated, that’s the answer.”

What makes up “girl world”? And who gets to exist within it? These inquiries have fascinated artists for years. Photographer Karen Marshall asked herself those questions in the 1980s, toward the end of the women's liberation movement, and decided to explore the friendships of young women and their tendency to form emblematic, or symbolic, relationships — the kind where you don't have to say anything, and the other person just gets you.Marshall met Molly, a high school student, through friends who employed her as a babysitter in 1986 and began photographing her and her friends in New York City throughout their junior year. That summer, while on vacation in Cape Cod, Molly was killed at age 17 when she was hit by a car. Marshall decided to continue the series, her images ultimately examining not only how close this group of girls were before the death of their friend, but how they coped as they finished high school and moved apart. Marshall ended up following a core group of seven women on and off for decades until the mid-2010s. Advertisement  Her photos have now been collected into a book over 30 years in the making, which is split up into different parts and throughout which you can see the girls grow and adapt to the world around them.“It's like a piece of cinema,” Marshall said. “You can read it from cover to cover and have a full experience.”The bond between the women is emblematic of many other young friendships; some continue to be close, others lose touch and move to different places, and some were never close to begin with but were united in their shared connection with Molly.BuzzFeed News spoke with Marshall about her book, Between Girls, and how she earned the trust of teenagers.
 


You’ve been working on this book for 30 years! Does it feel good to have it out in the world?It does! It's like, finally. I made a decision that this was a long game, and there were sacrifices. Sometimes a project has its own mind, and I really, totally trust the process. I also teach process; it's a big thing in my life. Along the way it never felt right. I had to keep waiting. Finally I was like, OK, it's now time to do the book and to do it correctly. Sometimes a person works on a project, and five months later it's a done deal, whether it’s an article or a big exhibit. Sometimes that's what happens, and sometimes it happens this way.How did you meet Molly and her friends?I was 27 [and] I asked everyone I knew if they knew any teenagers. I had met some other folks before Molly who I didn't jibe with. A friend of mine who was older had just had a kid, and Molly babysat for them. They said, “Oh my gosh, I know who you need to photograph.” Molly was such a big character, and they had known her since she was really young. I contacted her and explained what I wanted to do. She got it, and from the very first day of photographing her and her friend Jenn I knew that this was what I was looking for. Advertisement  Which was?I was looking from the outset for the emotional bonding that happens between girls when they're 16. I believe strongly that there's a super-strong language that happens with women, and it was hard to explain that to people in 1985. I grew up in the women's consciousness movement, and my mother and my teacher and my friends were all talking about this and into it in the 1970s. I was curious in 1985 if the girls then were affected, their friendships and relationships, because of what their moms’ generation went through.
 


Did you have this connection with friends when you were this age?I did not have a solid group like these girls. These girls really had this whole network. I had girlfriends who meant a lot to me, and a sister and a cousin, so I had a girl world. In undergrad at the time, most of the people in the photo department were guys. One thing I knew going into the project is that there existed these friendships that seemed like they were timeless. The concept of people who I saw every few months or years, and I could grunt three times the next time I saw them and they would know where I was at — the emblematic relationship.What was that first year of photographing the girls like?It was wonderful. I had incredible access, I really liked them and was very impressed by them. They were so articulate, their natural ability to understand where they were at really blew me away. They really allowed me to be a fly on the wall. I would go into these situations, and at a certain point they wouldn’t care if I was there. That was amazing, and on the other hand there was no email and no cellphones, so I was flying by the seat of my pants. I was like, OK, I'm going to meet you at this street corner at 3:30 on Wednesday, and I never knew who was going to be there. No one ever stood me up, but I was always scared.
 


Did they look up to you?I feel like I was a cool, maybe like, camp counselor to them. I was too old to be their sister but not old enough to be their mothers. And I was different, obviously, but I didn't look that much older, so there was a tribal allegiance with the girls. We talk a lot in photography these days about photographing your own community, which I was sort of doing then.When I tried to run the work in the early days, people said, ""No one wants to look at New York City girls in the Midwest."" I would call up editors, including the chief editor of Seventeen magazine, and I always wish I had been able to record something because they would spend the entire time talking about their high school years and then tell me that there was no way they were going to run the work, because these dark-haired, curly-haired girls weren't their readership. We don't think about that, how much things have changed.After that first year, what happened next?Junior year was over; the girls were going away for the summer and doing different things. Senior year was shaping up to be so different for them, and I wasn't sure if I should end or continue the work. The last picture I made of Molly was about 10 days before she was killed. She was going off to Cape Cod, and there was so much energy in the air. Advertisement  When I found out about Molly, it was unbelievably devastating. I ended up speaking at her memorial service. [After] following her and documenting her so closely and then she's gone, it really blew my mind. I knew that I needed, for Molly's sake, to figure out a way to put this out in the world.Every once in a while I would see the girls, but it was really difficult. Later on, the girls admitted they were all hiding from each other. I only saw them really if I would bump into them. Meanwhile, I was trying to figure out what this book was. But I was really certain that I wanted to document them before they went away to college. The beginning of the book is 1985–1986, and then in the middle it goes into what I like to refer to as “reverb,” so it goes backwards from her death through graduation, prom, middle school, and then it flips into sections of each of them over the years.
 


How old were you when you picked up a camera?I started photographing when I was 13 years old. I grew up in an artistically oriented family; my mother was in the theater and produced and directed plays. I've always been interested in real life — life as it unfolds and not the studio thing. I did a lot of photographing of fellow students in high school; we were a community in that sense. I started photographing teenagers when I was a teenager. When I went to college, I wanted to get a liberal arts degree and learn sociology and anthropology. I ended up in a department that was photo- and film-oriented, but essentially the first 10 years of being a serious photographer, post–high school, I did primarily environmental portraits out on the street, looking through the camera with a medium-format Rolleiflex.When I started the Between Girls project, I wanted to move inside physically and emotionally. I didn't want to be out on the street, and I wanted to be in people's lives and in their psychology. Advertisement  How did you feel about your own work as you saw as you saw the lives of teenage girls progressing over time?Honestly, I don't think teenage girls have changed a lot. Sure, the evolution of Myspace to Facebook to Instagram to TikTok have changed things, but on another level they don't change them as much as people want to write about. On one hand, it's such a great relief that there's so much more work out there of and by girls and women. So many more women have a platform, it's stunning. And it’s what I would hope for. The the phone camera has given young girls a platform to document their lives more easily. These girls were doing it, I was doing it, and now people just have the access to do it more.There have been times when there have been large projects out there defining women, and I feel like it's often in more linear terms. What I was looking at — the language that women share with each other, and the loss of a friend and how deep that goes — is a little different than some of the others.In our mind's eye, in our memory of everything we can look at, it's incredible that we can see the diversity of lives and the diversity of identity. Advertisement  During COVID, I kept thinking that I was really glad I didn't have a teenager in the house, and my next thought was that I was really sad for all the teenagers out there. This is huge and really painful. They need space away from people and just with each other. It also made me think about myself, and the friendships I had during COVID; it highlighted what was really important to me.
 


Are you in touch with the girls today? How do they feel looking back on the images of themselves in the book?I'm in touch with the girls to this day. I gave a talk a few weeks ago, and the three that are in New York came. They love the book, and that means a lot to me. Two people live on the West Coast. I've been bothering them for so long, I've made them be intentionally introspective on it all. I've directed them to that touchstone. I can't help but know that I've influenced them to some extent. Advertisement  I think they're happy that they have the images, even the ones with Molly, which are a little painful. It comes and goes. She was a really important friend, and she never got to be an adult with them, and she would have been a really amazing adult. I think the remaining girls are also modest. I have been part of their life for more of their life than not, and they're New York City kids after all. There's no self-consciousness or grandiosity in this house, to put it that way.

419,"Sunday night’s satire of the symbiotic relationship between right-wing media and Republican politicians is based firmly in reality, star Alan Ruck (Connor Roy) told BuzzFeed News.","


In the sixth episode of Succession’s third season on Sunday, the Roy family heads to a conservative political summit in Virginia, ostensibly to hobnob with top Republicans and talk policy — but in reality to crown a new king.With the family’s right-wing cable news network having effectively forced out the current president by pushing unfounded claims about his mental faculties (sound familiar?), Logan Roy (Brian Cox) is auditioning Republicans to decide whom he — and his media empire — will support for the top job. Advertisement     It’s “The Room Where It Happens” — except, as Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen) tells Cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun), this is “a nice safe space where you don’t have to pretend to like Hamilton.”It’s also the show’s most biting political episode to date.As legal troubles have mounted, Succession viewers have become accustomed to seeing the government exert influence on family company Waystar Royco, with FBI agents raiding its corporate offices, the DOJ investigating, and top staffers being hauled before Congress. But this is the first time we’ve seen such a naked exploration of how the Roys — and the Murdoch family, on whom they’re based — influence government.“You do get the feeling that the real power — as we all know — resides with the people who control all the money and many of our so-called leaders are just dutiful servants obeying their masters,” star Alan Ruck (Connor Roy) told BuzzFeed News in an interview. “I would say this is probably the first time we’ve seen Logan in action how he goes about protecting his interests through his political picks.” Advertisement     
 


In the episode, the Roys host a blunt discussion in Logan’s hotel room — note that he, not the vice president, is staying in the royal suite — as they weigh the pros and cons of each candidate and, crucially, what they might mean for the DOJ investigation into Waystar.Ruck said he genuinely believes that the wealthy and powerful gather in such rooms every four years to make decisions that alter the course of the country. “I absolutely think that it’s true,” he said. “Kings are made, kings are crowned, and some rise and some don’t. It just depends who they know.”The episode is a particularly crucial one for Ruck’s character, the middle-aged scion of a billionaire who has never had to work a day in his life but who is now searching for purpose (and his father’s love) with an outlandish run for president.Until now, Connor’s libertarian campaign has been something of a joke across the series and inside the Roy family. But, as Shiv (Sarah Snook) silently confesses to younger brother Roman (Kieran Culkin) as she takes her first glimpse of the far-right attendees at the summit, “in a room full of Timothy McVeighs, does Connor suddenly look like a Roosevelt?”In perhaps one of the most surreal moments of the entire series, at more than one point Logan asks those around him whether they should, in fact, get behind Connor’s run for office. “Joe Kennedy did it for his boys,” Logan quips. Advertisement     Shiv and Roman seem as stunned as those watching at home that the idea is even being considered. “Are we being serious about this?” Roman asks. “We’re talking about trying to make Connor president of the United States. Crappants.”The moment is reminiscent of the feeling that millions of Americans had in 2016 as they slowly watched the campaign of Donald Trump move from joke to serious to… successful. Connor is even described by a supporter at one stage with terms that could easily apply to Trump: “He’s got a brand name, war chest, populist appeal, and he’s a fighter.”Ruck told BuzzFeed News he thinks Logan’s flash of consideration for Connor’s candidacy stems in part from the guilt he felt in abandoning his oldest son as a child to his troubled ex-wife, but is also obviously self-interested.“I don’t think Logan would do anything with this political stuff if it wasn’t advantageous for him, so the only reason he’d consider Connor is if somehow Connor would prove useful in that position,” Ruck said. “Obviously, he feels, and probably rightly so, that he could wrap Connor around his figure and get him to do anything he wanted.”It finally falls to Cousin Greg, the only other character who is played for laughs as much as Connor, to be the one brave enough to speak out against the oldest Roy’s quest for president and what it could mean for the republic. “I think I owe it to my country to say I don’t think you should crown — or make Connor president,” he tells Logan.“I think in that instance [Greg] had a moment of clarity and realized if this happens it could be the end of the financial solvency of the United States of America,” Ruck said. “If Connor becomes president, it could be a sign of the end times!”The episode was filmed in April, Ruck said, a full year after the show’s initial production start date was pushed back due to the pandemic (Ruck himself tested positive for COVID during filming and had to quarantine for 10 days). While some exterior scenes were shot in Virginia, most of the interiors were filmed in New York City, including at the famous Plaza Hotel, which, to continue the theme, Trump once owned. Advertisement     The entire 60 minutes of this episode ruthlessly satirizes Republicans today. As the billionaire Roys mingle in the hotel’s gilded ballroom, the show’s vice president (Reed Birney) states without a hint of irony that the GOP has become “the party of the working class now” while the “Dems and tech hold all the wealth.” (This joke about elites again emerges later as Tom talks lyrically about what he admits is terrible wine then eats at a diner to get a taste of what he imagines prison food will be like.)Meanwhile, another contender for the top job, an extreme-right congressman with fascist leanings (Justin Kirk), jokes with Roman about sending people to gulags — “not work camps, summer camps” — and admits he’s willing to entertain ideas from Spanish dictator Francisco Franco or even a certain, more well-known German dictator who he refers to only as “H.”“There was a very naughty boy named H,” Roman responds.In yet another allusion to Trump, when Logan ultimately decides to support this firebrand — much to the horror of Shiv, who continues to swallow her morals — it’s in part because Roman has correctly observed that cable news viewers will be enraged, engrossed, or entertained by him.Ruck said this reflects on the “symbiotic” relationship between politicians and news outlets.“[These media executives think], ‘If we pick the right guy, we’re gonna have ratings through the roof, at least with our core audience,’” he said. “I absolutely think that powerful people who control the information and have access to huge piles of money are very attracted to people who seek high office. They scratch each other’s backs.”
 


Ruck, who was most famous before Succession for his roles in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off and the sitcom Spin City, admits his left-wing politics inform his approach to the characters on the show. (Ruck made headlines in September when he volunteered to drive a press escort van as President Joe Biden visited California for a rally to support Gov. Gavin Newsom.) Advertisement     “But there’s a little bit of Connor in everybody because nobody wants to pay taxes,” he joked.Still, he cautioned Succession fans not to count Connor out, teasing that the Roys may regret their many years of teasing his character.“As time goes on, we’re gonna see that Connor is not going to be the family punching bag anymore,” Ruck said. “At some point — and I’m not saying it’s going to happen this season — Connor is going to find his teeth and he’s going to bite back.”

Tens of thousands of people took to the streets in major European cities over the weekend to protest vaccine mandates and other coronavirus-related restrictions as cases and deaths from the virus rise across the region.According to the World Health Organization, Europe saw a 5% increase in new COVID-19 deaths during the week ending Nov. 14, while other regions worldwide reported that fatalities were stabilizing or declining. Globally, cases continued to rise 6%, compared to the previous week, with more than 3.3 million new COVID-19 cases reported. Advertisement     Even against more contagious variants of the coronavirus, COVID vaccines are safe and effective. They have been thoroughly tested and are now under the most intense safety monitoring in US history, according to the CDC. More than 450 million doses have been given in the US as of Nov. 22, and worldwide, about 3.3 billion people, or 42% of the population, have been vaccinated. (You can check this COVID vaccine tracker to see the latest numbers.)The main side effects are short term swelling at the injection site, fever, and body aches. More serious side effects are extremely rare, and the benefits far outweigh the risks.
 


In Austria, where officials are imposing a new lockdown starting Monday along with a nationwide vaccine mandate to take effect next year, an estimated 40,000 people, including members of far-right groups, marched through Vienna on Saturday. After dark, protesters threw bottles and fired pyrotechnics at police, who used pepper spray to disperse the crowds, according to the Associated Press.
 


In the Netherlands, riots broke out in multiple cities. On Friday night, 49 people were arrested after a crowd of hundreds torched cars, set off fireworks, and threw rocks at police in Rotterdam in what the Dutch city's mayor described as an ""orgy of violence."" Police responded with water cannons and gunfire, injuring at least four people, officials said.In Brussels, Belgium, 35,000 gathered on Sunday to protest new rules that make working from home mandatory for four days a week, limit the number of people at gatherings, and require masks for indoor and some outdoor activities.“We denounce the measures restricting freedom, that haven’t constituted a structural solution for health services,” protest organizers said in a statement, according to Politico.
 


At times, demonstrators clashed with police, throwing rocks and smoke bombs as law enforcement fired water and tear gas at the crowd.Demonstrations also took place in Italy, Switzerland, Croatia, and Northern Ireland.

422,Other emails obtained by BuzzFeed News show how the DOJ strategized about public messaging leading up to Jan. 6.,"


WASHINGTON — On Jan. 6 at 10:43 a.m., three top Justice Department officials received an email with an update on a briefing that morning from the counterterrorism section.“There are no credible threats as of the 10:00 brief,” a person from the National Security Division whose name is redacted wrote to Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general; Michael Sherwin, the acting US attorney in Washington; and John Moran, chief of staff to Jeffrey Rosen, the acting attorney general. Advertisement     By that time, thousands of people had gathered near the White House for a “Stop the Steal” rally. Former president Donald Trump’s supporters had been openly threatening violence online for weeks. The subsequent prosecution of hundreds of people charged with assaulting the Capitol — an attack that unfolded roughly two hours after the 10:43 a.m. email was sent — revealed that a number of them came armed. The night before, an as-yet-unidentified person had placed two pipe bombs at the headquarters of the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee; those devices would be discovered a few hours after the email was sent.The email was part of a cache of documents obtained by BuzzFeed News through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit that fills in more of the timeline of what was going on internally at the Justice Department before, during, and after the Capitol riot. The FBI afterward characterized the attack on the Capitol as an act of domestic terrorism, but the message from that morning showed that counterterrorism officials didn’t consider there to be a threat hours before.In the immediate aftermath of the Capitol insurrection, BuzzFeed News filed dozens of FOIA requests with multiple government agencies, including the DOJ, in an effort to obtain a wide range of documents that would show how top officials planned for the protests and their response to the violence that ensued. The news organization subsequently filed lawsuits for the records when the agencies indicated they would be unable to respond to the requests in a timely manner.The latest 106-page collection is heavily redacted. The government withheld vast swaths of information citing privacy, ongoing law enforcement investigations, law enforcement techniques and procedures, and the physical safety of informants. The Justice Department will continue to release records about the insurrection to BuzzFeed News on a rolling, monthly basis. Advertisement     A Senate report released in June about the attack noted that the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security hadn’t considered threats of violence posted online by Trump’s supporters leading up to Jan. 6 to be credible. Senate investigators also found that an FBI situational information report dated Jan. 5 prepared by the bureau’s Norfolk, Virginia, office warning about potential violence was circulated among law enforcement agencies, but didn’t appear to get much attention internally.The new documents show that a week after the attack, officials at the highest levels of the Justice Department were sharing copies of the five-page Norfolk report. The Washington Post published an article about the document on Jan. 12; one of the lead reporters tweeted a link to it at 12:16 p.m. At 2:40 p.m. an FBI official whose name was redacted emailed a copy of the report to a DOJ public affairs official. That message was forwarded to Donoghue, and Donoghue, who also received a separate email with a copy of the report, sent it to Rosen.The documents also included messages that senior DOJ officials exchanged in the two days leading up to Jan. 6. These emails reflected a sensitivity around the public optics of any federal officer deployment in Washington and what, if anything, Rosen should say in advance of the expected demonstrations.On Jan. 5, Rosen exchanged a series of emails with senior DOJ officials about drafting a statement from him “for Jan. 6.” The drafts included in these messages are redacted, but one official in Rosen’s office wrote that the “tone” was “generally consistent” with statements that former attorney general Bill Barr had released denouncing violence that was part of some protests last year against police brutality. That day, Moran also emailed Patrick Philbin in the White House counsel’s office to share that they were drafting a statement for Rosen.“We wanted to share for WHCO’s awareness. And of course, if you have any thoughts we would welcome them,” Moran wrote. Philbin’s response is redacted.People across the Justice Department at that time were discussing how to handle messaging around federal law enforcement deployments to Washington. The previous summer, DOJ came under intense public scrutiny — and faced an inspector general investigation — when federal officers were deployed in Portland, Oregon, and Washington, DC, to respond to protests. Advertisement     On Jan. 4, a spokesperson for the federal Bureau of Prisons messaged a DOJ public affairs official that BOP was assembling officers in Washington “in case” they were needed, and included a draft response about that to any “potential” questions from reporters. The draft statement was redacted. The BOP official noted with a smiley face emoji in a later message that he hadn’t received any media inquiries so far.The next morning, officials with the Justice Department’s Office of Legislative Affairs exchanged emails about the BOP officers being deployed to Washington and discussed being “prepared for Hill inquiries” once the public learned about it.On the afternoon of Jan. 5, Rosen exchanged emails with a public affairs official about how to respond to a letter that DC Mayor Muriel Bowser had written to Rosen — and tweeted out — stating that the city wasn’t asking for more federal law enforcement and discouraging more deployments without local consultation. Most of the contents of those emails are redacted. That evening and into the next morning, top officials also discussed a request by the House Intelligence Committee for information about how federal law enforcement and the Department of Defense were planning for Jan. 6.Hours after the riot, the records show public affairs officials at the departments of Justice and Defense and a person from Homeland Security whose name was redacted had a strong negative reaction to a tweet that paraphrased former senator Claire McCaskill criticizing the lack of briefing from law enforcement after the insurrection.“This is crazy. I was on a phone call with the AG, Deputy AG, DOD Secretary, Vice President Pence, Senate leader McConnell, minority leader McCarthy, Sen. Schumer, and House Speaker Pelosi tonight at 7:20 and we briefed them all on this and told them that we cleared their chambers and they could go back in and restart their sessions,” Justice Department spokesperson Marc Raimondi wrote in an 11:29 p.m. message about the tweet.“As far as I’m aware, our teams did everything by the book and we shouldn’t let anyone besmirch them,” the Homeland Security official responded.The Justice Department also released call logs that reveal who Rosen and Donoghue spoke with on Jan. 6, including numerous calls with White House counsel Pat Cipollone and other White House officials. The Justice Department notes that it was unable to authenticate the identities of the callers associated with the phone numbers. Advertisement

423,“There’s precedent for acquittals like this to be used in inciting to and carrying out further violence.”,"


The acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse is emboldening far-right groups across the extremist spectrum, and experts are warning it may inspire more racially motivated violence in the future.As a jury on Friday acquitted 18-year-old Rittenhouse of five felony charges after he killed Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and seriously wounded Gaige Grosskreutz during a protest over police brutality against Black Americans, his fans on the extreme far right celebrated online. They held him up as “the hero we’ve been waiting for” and called him a “saint” — a title that they often give to racially motivated mass murderers and right-wing terrorists. Advertisement     “The ‘saints’ of the far right include the Charleston, Christchurch, Poway, Pittsburgh, and El Paso shooters … and now they also include Rittenhouse,” Alex Newhouse, deputy director of the Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies ​​at Monterey, told BuzzFeed News.The Proud Boys, “boogaloo boys,” subscribers to the QAnon mass delusion, Christian Identity fanatics, illegal militant groups, a neo-Nazi political party, and accelerationist terror groups were among those BuzzFeed News found heaping praise in channels and chats on social messaging apps Telegram, Gab, and Discord. “Hail Rittenhouse!” someone wrote in a white nationalist group with more than 50,000 followers.“Our patience has its limits,” read one message scrawled over a photoshopped image of a gun-toting Rittenhouse with red eyes. Another image showed a sketch of the teenager wielding an assault rifle against a backdrop of the Black Sun symbol (also known as a sonnenrad) used by Nazi Germany. Beside him are the words “fuck antifa” and a swastika. It was shared across several groups that in other times would have been ideologically at odds with each other.Rittenhouse’s exoneration is bringing together a potentially dangerous mix of right-wing actors who’ve seized on the moment.“This is a particularly emphatic example of the growing unification under extreme anti-government accelerationist goals that is occurring among the American right wing,” Newhouse said. “Even in 2020, the Proud Boys were pitted against the ‘boogaloo boys’ and some neofascists in support of the Black Lives Matter protests and subsequent riots. Now, they have all rallied around Rittenhouse as a person who walks the walk of revolutionary [and] accelerationist myth; he actually went out onto the streets and took violent action against protesters.” Advertisement     A handful of Republican members of Congress also rushed to praise Rittenhouse on Friday, and at least one offered him an internship.“Hard to describe how chilling it is to see members of the GOP and open white supremacists come together to celebrate a vigilante killing two people and getting away with it,” Cassie Miller, an extremism researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center, tweeted.Attorneys for Rittenhouse did not respond to requests for comment.His acquittal comes as the US is grappling with a resurgence in far-right violence that has plagued the country since Donald Trump’s presidency. The Department of Justice and the FBI have said the top threat facing the US comes from racially or ethnically motivated violent domestic extremists, like the ones applauding Rittenhouse. History shows in moments like this, punctuated with acquittals like his, are often followed by more violent acts, experts said.“There’s precedent for acquittals like this to be used in inciting to and carrying out further violence,” Newhouse said.He pointed to the Greensboro massacre in 1979, when members of the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party shot and killed five antiracist activists in the North Carolina city. Emboldened by the killings, membership in the KKK and Nazi groups reportedly rose in the aftermath, and members went on to commit more acts of racial violence.“Already, the far right is using Rittenhouse’s full acquittal as tacit approval of at least vigilante violence — and, in many cases, they’re calling for the expansion of anti-leftist political violence more broadly,” Newhouse said.On Telegram, some far-right extremist groups called for armed citizens to go out to the streets on Friday night in a show of force.“They are making a point to say ‘load up your guns and be ready to shoot,’ another escalation from even last year,” Newhouse said.While it’s unclear whether these online calls will gain steam, historian Kathleen Belew, coauthor of A Field Guide to White Supremacy, suggested the acquittal alone was enough to inspire IRL action.“It has never taken more than a whisper of approval to fan the flames of militant right action, and the Kenosha acquittal is a shout,” she tweeted.

424,A cohort of republicans rushed to praise Rittenhouse after he was found not guilty on all charges.,"


WASHINGTON — A small cohort of Republican lawmakers and candidates are heroizing Kyle Rittenhouse and celebrating his acquittal of murder in the killing of two people during protests over the police shooting of Jacob Blake last August.In a series of social media posts and media appearances both before and after Friday's verdict, those Republicans have encouraged Rittenhouse and offered him congressional internships.In a video posted Friday, Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina proclaimed Rittenhouse’s innocence, and said, “You have a right to defend yourselves. Be armed, be dangerous, and be moral.” In a caption on the video, Cawthorn wrote, “Kyle: If you want an internship, reach out to me.” Advertisement     
 


But that wasn’t Rittenhouse’s only offer of employment.In an interview with Newsmax earlier this week, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz endorsed him for an internship at the Capitol. “Rittenhouse would make a pretty good congressional intern,” Gaetz told the host.Gaetz retweeted the offer after the verdict. (Gaetz, notably, might need the staff: He recently experienced some turnover in his office after reports that he was being investigated for child sex trafficking.)This embrace of Rittenhouse and vigilantism has ignited a new debate over gun rights and self-defense, and further cements the Republican Party’s welcoming of anti–Black Lives Matter sentiments.Rittenhouse is the latest addition to a group of celebrated figures in the party like Patricia and Mark McCloskey, the Missouri couple charged with the unlawful use of a weapon after they were filmed pointing guns at Black Lives Matter protesters and who were featured prominently at the 2020 Republican National Convention. Mark McCloskey, who is now running for US Senate in Missouri, appeared outside the courtroom during Rittenhouse’s trial.Rittenhouse faced murder charges after killing two men, Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, and wounding another, Gaige Grosskreutz, at a protest last summer over the shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Wisconsin.He pleaded not guilty to all charges against him — including two counts of first-degree homicide, two counts of recklessly endangering safety, and one count of attempted homicide — and was acquitted after 26 hours of jury deliberation.Republican support for Rittenhouse goes at least as far back as November 2020, when Florida state Rep. Anthony Sabatini, who’s now running for United States Congress, tweeted, “KYLE RITTENHOUSE FOR CONGRESS.”Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene also supported Rittenhouse, writing in a tweet Friday that he was one of the “good guys.”“Those who help, protect, and defend are the good guys,” she wrote. “Kyle is one of good ones.”

425,The FDA has authorized booster shots for all adults to give added protection and help prevent more outbreaks. A CDC advisory committee voted unanimously to endorse the move.,"


When it comes to the biggest health story of the 21st century — COVID-19, of course — there are some glimmers of hope.Although the Delta variant rolled through the US in late summer, pushing cases to levels not seen since early 2021 (with a corresponding rise in the death toll), daily COVID cases and hospitalizations declined in November. Advertisement     But the pandemic is far from over. Given the emergence of the Omicron variant and the fact that COVID has come in waves, some experts are warning that there could be another wave coming this winter. Case numbers began rising again in early December. Deaths, more than 1,000 a day nationwide, and hospitalizations remain at severe levels among the unvaccinated.As people head indoors and vaccine immunity starts to wane — and with the emergence of potentially more transmissible variants like Omicron — cases could climb even higher. That’s led the FDA to authorize booster shots for all people 16 and older to give added protection and help prevent more outbreaks. In January, the agency added 12 to 15 year olds to that authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech shots, a decision the CDC endorsed after an advisory panel vote, opening the door to those kids getting boosters in the US.""We now recommend that all adolescents aged 12-17 years should receive a booster shot 5 months after their primary series,"" said CDC chief Rochelle Walensky, in a statement. ""This booster dose will provide optimized protection against COVID-19 and the Omicron variant.""
 


In November, the FDA first authorized, and a CDC advisory committee endorsed, a recommendation that everyone 18 and older should get a booster if they were vaccinated with a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccine, as should all adults who received the Johnson & Johnson shot.On Dec. 9, the FDA and CDC updated that recommendation to include 16- and 17-year-olds, who can now get a Pfizer booster six months or more after getting the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. (The Pfizer vaccine is the only one currently recommended for children ages 5 and older.)The Pfizer vaccine has been available to people 16 years and older for almost a year, and “its benefits have been shown to clearly outweigh potential risks,” said Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a statement.When CDC director Rochelle Walensky updated the booster recommendations in November, she cited concern about the Omicron variant to explain the decision.""All adults are now eligible for COVID-19 booster shots,"" said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra in a statement. ""This is especially important ahead of the winter months, where we all spend more time indoors.""The FDA's recent decisions aim to eliminate confusion about who can receive a booster.""I think it's a good idea, just make it easy for people to get a booster, this simplifies things,"" said George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco. ""The concern is people who need a booster not getting one, because of confusion over their eligibility.""Following the advice of its own advisory panels, the FDA had announced in October that eligible individuals could mix and match vaccines for their booster dose. People who are 16 or 17 years old, however, are only eligible for a Pfizer vaccine for their original shots and for their booster.“Is there going to be a wave this winter? There will undoubtedly be a wave this winter among people who are unvaccinated,” Rutherford said. “But at least taking care of this problem of waning immunity will blunt the number of cases among people who have been fully vaccinated. So I think that’s good. There will be less morbidity and mortality because of that.” Advertisement     However, if you are unvaccinated, “you are hanging out in the wind,” Rutherford said. “Again, my only advice is to get vaccinated.” (Check out this vaccine tracker to see how many people have been vaccinated.)Here’s what you need to know about what booster shots are, when you should get them, who is eligible, whether you can mix and match vaccines, and the side effects you might experience.Boosters work.In general, if you have a healthy immune system, COVID vaccines can be more than 90% effective when it comes to preventing symptomatic COVID, hospitalizations, and death. (The one-shot J&J vaccine has typically been slightly less effective than the two-shot Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.)But protection can wane over time. A July 2021 study in Nature Medicine estimated that COVID vaccines with a 90% efficacy dropped to 70% in about seven months and 50% at about nine months. The drop in protection is caused by antibody levels decreasing over time, but also because of the highly contagious Delta variant, now the dominant strain in the US. But many scientists have argued that the vaccines are still highly protective for people who are not at high risk.In September, the FDA granted Pfizer permission to offer boosters for those at higher risk based on evidence that protection started to wane at four months. A study of the Pfizer vaccine found that protection against all variants and the Delta variant was 97% and 93%, respectively, one month after vaccination, but it declined to 67% and 53% four months later. Moderna also published research suggesting that protection wanes over time. People who got the Moderna vaccine during the previous eight months had 36% fewer infections than people vaccinated a year ago.A booster shot can help. FDA data suggests that getting one can reestablish strong protection against the virus. Pfizer, for example, claimed that a booster dose restored the vaccine to about 95% efficacy within a week, which is consistent with observations from Israel.“The available data suggest waning immunity in some populations who are fully vaccinated,” acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in an announcement on Oct. 20. “The availability of these authorized boosters is important for continued protection against COVID-19 disease.” Advertisement     The FDA and CDC have approved boosters for people 16 and older.The FDA has authorized booster doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines for anyone 18 and older who finished their initial two-dose vaccination series at least six months ago, or received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine at least two months ago.People who are 16 or 17 who completed their vaccination at least six months ago are also eligible for a booster shot, but can only receive it with the Pfizer vaccine.You should get a booster if you are 65 or older.In general, whether you’ve had the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or J&J vaccine, you should get a booster if you are 65 or older. This is regardless of your job, living circumstances, or underlying health conditions.The risk of getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19 goes up as you age, starting in your 50s and increasing in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. People who are 85 or older are at particularly high risk.You should get a booster if you have a health condition that puts you at high risk.If you are an adult who’s younger than 65 but you have an underlying health condition, you should get a booster — particularly if you are 50 or older.That includes people who are pregnant, obese or overweight, or immunocompromised and those who have a health condition such as:CancerChronic kidney, liver, or lung diseases (such as moderate or severe asthma)DementiaDiabetesDown syndromeGenetic conditions, such as sickle cell disease or thalassemiaHeart diseasesHigh blood pressureHIVMental health conditions such as depression or schizophreniaStrokeTuberculosisPeople who smoke, people who used to smoke, and those with substance use disorders, like alcoholism or opioid use disorder, should also get a booster. (The CDC notes that this list isn’t the final word; there are other conditions that put you at risk, so talk with your doctor about your own personal risk.)The risk is higher for people with health conditions who are 50 or older, so they are strongly encouraged to get boosters.If you are at risk due to your job.Other people who might most need a booster are those who work in occupations that put them at risk for COVID-19.That includes:Healthcare workersFirefightersPoliceEducators, such as teachers, daycare workers, and support staffUS postal workersPublic transit workersFood and agriculture workersThose who work in grocery stores, corrections, or manufacturingIf you are at risk due to where you live.People who live in high-risk congregate settings like homeless shelters, prisons, jails, and healthcare or mental health institutions are at higher risk of COVID and might more heavily consider getting a booster.If you are pregnant, you can get a booster.People who are pregnant, recently gave birth, or who are thinking about getting pregnant should get vaccinated. They are also eligible for booster shots.As of the end of Oct. 11, more than 22,000 people who were pregnant have been hospitalized and 180 have died due to COVID, according to the CDC. People who are pregnant and have symptomatic COVID are twice as likely to be hospitalized and have a 70% higher risk of dying than people who are not pregnant, the federal agency said.“COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future,” according to the CDC.The partners of people who are trying to get pregnant should also get a vaccine.All adults who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine can get a booster.The FDA advisory panel has unanimously recommended that anyone who is 18 or older and received a J&J vaccine get a booster two months after they received their dose.The J&J vaccine has advantages in that it’s one shot instead of two. But although it’s highly effective at protecting against COVID, it hasn’t been quite as effective as the other vaccines available in the US.For example, CDC data suggests that when it came to preventing COVID hospitalizations, Moderna was 93% effective, Pfizer was 88% effective, and the J&J vaccine was 71% effective.Some FDA advisers even suggested that the J&J vaccine should have been a two-shot vaccine from the start.“I think this frankly was always a two-dose vaccine,"" said FDA vaccine advisory panel member Paul Offit of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. ""It’s hard to recommend this as a one-dose vaccine.”“It’s always been treated like the poor cousin of the mRNA vaccines and I think that’s unfair,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, codirector of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. “I think the benefits of the mRNA vaccine are probably a bit inflated and the disadvantages of the J&J vaccine have been a bit inflated.”Adults can mix and match boosters.If you got a J&J vaccine, can you get a Pfizer or Moderna booster?Yes, if you are 18 or older. Research suggests that might be a good approach: A National Institutes of Health study presented in October to the FDA advisory committee found that a Moderna booster given to people who had previously received a J&J shot produced the most antibodies against the coronavirus. A Pfizer booster given to people who had received a J&J shot produced slightly fewer antibodies. A J&J booster produced the least antibodies.That surprised the FDA’s advisers, who noted that standard practice is to boost a vaccine with its original shot to amplify the immune reaction it first triggered.However, Hotez noted that the study ended at 30 days, which “tends to stack the deck against seeing the benefits of the J&J vaccine,” he said.The J&J vaccine “gives you kind of a delayed kinetics so the antibody titers rise later,” Hotez said. More research may show J&J is more effective than seen in the study.The FDA’s authorization in October also allowed eligible individuals who received Pfizer’s or Moderna’s vaccines to mix and match booster shots. People who received two doses of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine can get any of the three authorized vaccines as their booster dose.There’s no real guidance on what booster shot you should get. The best combination of vaccines is still unclear, and the federal agency’s recommendations reflect that.“We wanted to provide a lot of flexibility because some people don't know what vaccine they got in certain circumstances,” Woodcock said at a press conference in October. “There are people who don't know, there are people who do not want to get the same vaccine they got before because they had some sort of reaction.”Any one of these combinations is reasonable, Marks said.It’s very important that anyone who is in an eligible group get a booster, Woodcock said. “We would expect that many folks will continue with the same regimen that they started with.”When you go to get a booster, you may be asked some questions to determine your eligibility, but you won’t necessarily need to provide medical verification. “They’re taking people at their word that they fall into one of the categories,” Marks said.When you should get a booster depends on the type of vaccine you received.If you are eligible to get a booster, you can get it at least six months after a Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. As mentioned, the CDC advisory panel recommended that adults 49 and younger ""may"" get a booster, not that they ""should,"" in this group.Anyone who received a J&J vaccine should wait at least two months before getting a booster.Boosters are a bit different from the “regular” vaccine.A booster isn’t necessarily just one more dose of a “regular” vaccine. It may be the same dose or it may be lower.If you received a Pfizer vaccine, you got two 30-microgram doses at least 21 days apart. The booster is also 30 micrograms.If you received the Moderna vaccine, you got two 100-microgram doses at least 28 days apart. The booster is a 50-microgram dose, or a half dose of one of your original vaccine shots. Moderna found that that dosage is sufficient, triggering a fourfold rise in the protective response against the Delta variant, according to one study.Moderna is also looking at future shots designed more directly against the Delta variant since it now composes 99% of US cases and looks likely to be the basis for future variants.The J&J booster is the same as the first dose, and it’s given at least two months after the shot.Some people need a third shot, not a booster.What’s the difference, you ask? A third shot is just that — the exact same dose as the first one or two, often given sooner than a booster — and it’s given to people who don’t have a robust enough response the first time around.Since August, the CDC has strongly encouraged people who have moderate to severe immune system problems to get a third shot.That includes people who have had an organ transplant, are currently getting cancer treatment, have HIV, or have to take immune-suppressing medication for autoimmune disorders and other conditions.Of people hospitalized for COVID in June and July, 86% were unvaccinated and 14% were vaccinated, according to CDC data. People with weaker immune systems make up 40% to 44% of the fully vaccinated people who need to be hospitalized.The death of Colin Powell, the first Black secretary of state for the United States, highlights the COVID risk for people with compromised immune systems. Powell, 84, was fully vaccinated but also had multiple myeloma, a type of cancer that can severely affect the immune system. In addition, the treatments for multiple myeloma, and other types of cancer, can reduce the efficacy of vaccines.If you have a weakened immune system, your third shot should be at least 28 days after the second dose of a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. (In other words, you don’t have to wait six months as you do for a booster.)There is not enough data at this time to know whether a second dose of a J&J shot protects immunocompromised people in the same way a third dose of a Pfizer or Moderna shot does, according to the CDC.Booster side effects are similar to getting a second vaccine shot.You may have experienced side effects after being vaccinated, particularly after getting the second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Symptoms like a headache, fever, or nausea can be a sign your immune system is reacting to the vaccine and churning out the protective antibodies you need.When it comes to the booster shot, studies have indicated you might have symptoms similar to what you experienced with the second dose of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.According to the FDA, most side effects were mild or moderate and included headache, fatigue, and muscle aches.More people said they had swollen glands and tenderness in the armpits after the booster than after the first vaccine.“Same as your second dose — sore arm and feeling flu-ish, but that’s about it,” Rutherford said. “You might want to take the next day off.”In presentations to the FDA’s vaccine advisers, Johnson & Johnson reported side effects that were mild and similar to or lower than those seen after the first shot. However, the data was very limited — measured in fewer than 40 people — and the FDA has not had time to double-check the company’s data, something that the agency said it would follow up on.The most common side effects reported after a Johnson & Johnson booster shot were headaches and tiredness.It takes a couple of weeks for booster protection to kick in.Your body needs a little time to make the antibodies you need to fight off COVID. So a booster isn’t instant protection.The first round of vaccines can take a couple of weeks to kick in, and a booster shot is the same.However, longer-lived “memory” immune cells are still in your body from the initial vaccination. For the vast majority of people, these can help protect against getting very sick or being hospitalized before a booster starts to help.In most people, immunity to the virus that causes COVID will start to rise in the weeks after you’ve had a booster shot. The Pfizer and Moderna booster shot effects reached their most effective point after 15 days, while the Johnson & Johnson booster increased steadily for at least 29 days afterward, and possibly longer.COVID boosters are free.Yes, they say nothing in life is free. But boosters for COVID vaccines are, indeed, at no cost. And they are widely available.“These boosters are free,” President Joe Biden said at a press briefing in October. “I’ll say it again: They’re free, available, and convenient to get.”You are still considered fully vaccinated even if you don’t get a booster.If it’s been two weeks since your second shot of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or two weeks after your single shot of the J&J vaccine, you are considered fully vaccinated.After that, even if you don’t get a booster, you are still fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.And finally, if you haven’t been vaccinated at all, get the shot — even if you have had COVID already.The pandemic is still ongoing, so it’s a good idea to get vaccinated if you haven’t already.“I think we’re in the eye of the hurricane again,” Hotez said. “We’ve seen the exact same pattern last year where it started going down around this time, and then as we moved towards the Thanksgiving holidays, then it started going back up.”If you have recovered from a COVID infection, you have some immunity to the virus.However, it may not be as much protection as the vaccine provides: A study in Kentucky suggested that unvaccinated people who weathered a past COVID-19 infection were 2.34 times more likely to get infected again than vaccinated ones, although research is ongoing.“I think there are still too many unvaccinated people, so the recommendation is to go ahead and get vaccinated,” Hotez said.All of the vaccines are good choices, he said. “I think they are all pretty equivalent in terms of safety profile and efficacy.”This is a developing story.

426,“It’s not difficult to find these stories.”,"


American culture promotes the long-standing belief that this country is the land of opportunity — that if you try hard enough, you can build the life you want. But that belief has been severely tested, especially recently, with rising income inequality, skyrocketing housing, healthcare and education costs, and the long-term effects of redlining and other exclusionary practices being laid bare. Nonetheless, the myth persists, at least until you look at photographer Matt Black’s first book, American Geography.Black is from the Central Valley in California, which has been one of the poorest regions in the country for the past century. He has spent almost three decades documenting the area, inspired by author John Steinbeck and photographer Dorothea Lange. His images, which are known for their high-contrast, almost cinematic aesthetic, deal with farming, poverty, and the social condition, topics that are easy to sideline as not being relevant to other, wealthier areas. Advertisement  To challenge this assumption, Black crisscrossed the country by mapping out a route of towns and cities that had poverty rates above 20%. Shockingly, every place he visited was within two hours driving distance of another, indicating that the vast majority of the country is dealing with chronic poverty.What he found over the course of five trips and the span of nine years belies the idea of opportunity and reveals the structural obstacles to success, from a lack of basic infrastructure to a long history of broken or unfulfilled promises. Although his pictures of people and places on the margins are singular, they call to mind the work of earlier documentarians who looked critically at American society, such as Robert Frank.Black wants the viewer to realize that this is what the details of inequality look like on the ground, and that it is the norm, not the exception, for a large swath of citizens. His book also has a companion site that provides additional details and context about his journey. He spoke with BuzzFeed News about the importance of visibility and what it’s like to spend weeks on a bus. Advertisement  
 


I know it's something that you've talked about before, but let's start at the beginning. You were a journalist in the Central Valley for about two decades, right? Advertisement  Yes. Starting actually in 1987, my junior year in high school at the local newspaper. I did that for a few years, went to school and then came back to start these photojournalistic projects focused on this place, and I did that for 20 years basically, which really kind of ties directly to the instigation of this book.I work on these stories here, but they spoke to these universal themes. I felt like I was constantly hitting a wall in that regard, and that my work was being dismissed because of geography, because it's this place in the middle of nowhere.You stopped traveling for this project about a year ago now. In some ways, this is a pretty volatile point in America. Why did you choose to produce the book now?Well, so much changed from the time I started. When I started Obama was the president.The stories that I've done in the past and the stories I was doing here take this idea that you're uncovering things, or you're looking backwards at things that have been forgotten, things that have been overlooked.There is an assumption that there was a pool of goodwill to just see issues get fixed, and that this visibility is the mechanism by which change comes in America. But all of a sudden, all those things started to be questioned. Advertisement  So instead of looking backwards or bringing things to light that were inadvertently overlooked, it started to feel more like prognostications, like, Oh my god, we're not coming from this and going to someplace better. We're going backwards.It didn't make me question the validity of the photos or the outcome of doing this work, but it changed the context around it.
 


You mentioned that you are really influenced by the Farm Security Administration (FSA) and by some of the journalists and photographers who were working in the 1930s, ’40s, and ’50s. Some of the images that you're making feel like they could still be of that time — you have an interview with a man in Kentucky who references Johnson, and I had to double-check that he was talking recently. Can you talk about the timeless sense of this work?That's interesting to bring up the Kentucky thing. There's this different kind of time we're talking about, particularly of places like here in the Central Valley. To me, those pictures from the FSA are not just examples of good photography. It's part of the history, of the texture of this place. It is what shaped us. The Dust Bowl here completely transformed this place, and it's part of the local language, it's part of the music you hear on the radio, it's part of everything. Advertisement  That history is much closer. The same is true in Kentucky. It's a commonality between places like this. Johnson and the change that was promised during that time is still very much part of the identity. It's a really important thing to that part of Kentucky, Martin County, that the president of the United States came and stood on Harold's porch.I'm very sensitive about the FSA thing. I'm trying to make a subtlety, but talking about it. I don't feel I'm working in that same way at all. I'm working from a completely different kind of perspective and a completely different time. But it is part of the reality that shaped me, both the place I'm from, the actual events, and those photographs. They exist on a continuum. If you go into Mississippi, how do you get away from Faulkner? You're not. It's the same idea.Can you talk a little bit about how you mapped this and how you went about visiting each of these places? Advertisement  There's this concept called concentrated poverty, when a community has a poverty rate of above 20%, that's a threshold number. I decided to map all of these areas of concentrated poverty in the Central Valley. and then this idea and opportunity came up to do a trip to take it beyond the Central Valley.It sounds kind of strange, but I had no idea if I'd be able to find enough places with 20% or higher poverty that could make a route that would make any sense. I literally took a map and census data and was putting dots on the map. Before I even started the trip or traveling, it blew my mind that you could actually find enough of these areas to be able to cross the whole country, and back. I felt like I'd already made this discovery, and that just set me on fire.
 


This is no longer about the place, this is everywhere. This challenges some pretty profound assumptions about how we look at the country. I was publishing the trips as journalistic pieces, and then within each trip there would be areas of focus. Advertisement  Driving was a big part of it, exploring and getting to a place and just walking and looking and trying to kind of stitch together this visual narrative. There was also a lot of journalism involved. During the first trip, somewhat by chance, I went to Flint. I was looking for an example of a Rust Belt city, where I could stay a few weeks and concentrate on the issues of unemployment. People were talking about [the water] in town, but it hadn't become a story yet.Relatedly, I somewhat by chance chose Standing Rock as a way to look at natural resources. The dam that's on the river there, when they built it, they flooded the historical community. When I was there people, same thing as in Flint, they're talking about, Oh, there's this pipeline they want to do. We should really do something about that. And then the next year, both of those things exploded.Honestly, it did feel strange because my whole identity as a photographer and as a person is like, I'm going to focus on my corner. I didn't like the idea of being some journalist that has no stake in the stories that they're telling and all that. I rejected that whole concept, but this felt legitimate because when I was building this story. I was telling the story of my place basically through all of these other places and looking for these commonalities. I feel like I inadvertently put my finger on this kind of live wire.
 


You reference that you're traveling to a lot of these places by train or by bus. Can you talk a little bit about that and the choice to do that?The second trip I did, in 2016 or the end of 2015, was by Greyhound. I went from Calexico, California, on the border to Maine and back.That's a long journey on a bus.It was very long. I was utterly tired of driving after that first trip, and then [the bus] just felt like the proper place to be sitting. A lot of the material that has to do with the bus and [being] so uncomfortable that one trip. It's so limiting though, on a bus. Buses have really changed in America, I learned.How so?Well, you don't have bus stations anymore. On the East Coast, you do, but in the rest of the country, you don't. So a bus station will be like, the parking lot of a convenience store, oftentimes next to the highway. One example, this is the second or third stop on that trip was in Gallup, New Mexico, in the middle of winter. It was January, and I got dropped off at the bus stop. It's 6 miles to town. Advertisement  
 


That's what this whole thing is talking about. Just the grinding wheels of America on top of people who take the bus, on top of people who don't have money. Basically I just got a huge dose of that on that trip, and I'm glad I did it. I had to go back to driving for the other ones, but there's something so powerful about that bus trip.At some point, I'm not sure if it made it into the book or not, but in one of the notebook entries I had dealt with trying to wash your clothes without a car and without a laundry machine, without like just going to the laundromat and back. It's all day, right? By the time you get over there and the machine's broken and eats your quarters and you know — there's the saying, I didn't coin it, but there's this saying is, “It's expensive to be poor.” And it's expensive in time too. Everything takes multiple steps, multiple trips. One misstep and you're completely shattered, right? Broken taillight. There's a $300 ticket that you can't afford. And there goes your car. All those kinds of things. Advertisement  What do you want to make sure that viewers see when they look at this book?I'm trying to show that the country actually is from the ground level. It's not something that was invented. This was: You get in the car, you drive, you don't just go to the usual locations. You actually cover the ground. This is what you see.I went into this with the idea that I would have to look, that this would be difficult to find. It's not. It's not difficult to find these stories. I think it's back to this idea of how we regard poverty in this country. We still cling to these ideas of the land of opportunity, bootstraps, all these things, and they are not applicable. It does not work anymore — and the people are the victims, who walk around and live their lives feeling as if their circumstance is their fault, an example of their own personal failings. So I want to challenge the entire ideology. It's not accurate. It's not based on the actual reality of this country.
 


Have things changed in the Central Valley over the course of your reporting there?It depends on how you define change. It still remains one of the poorest regions in the country. There have been improvements. A lot of those improvements were the result of these social movements, hand in hand with photography and journalism. Just down from where I live is farmworker housing that was built back in the ‘30s. Eleanor Roosevelt came to the ribbon cutting, and it was built in direct response to the pictures of Dorothea Lange and the other FSA people that were coming here at that time.People got tired of seeing those pictures of people living on the side of roads, and that's what drove the public will. There's other examples of things like that — does that mean that everybody here now has great housing? No, but it does mean that some do. Bathrooms are now required in the fields, shade, and drinking water for people who are working in the fields. That was not the case before the farm workers union, and they worked hand in hand with reporters and photographers to push those changes.We've gotten so cynical now about the role of documentary, which I understand. I fell completely out of love with how journalism is practiced in this country. However, that does not mean that these roles of communication about social issues are not crucially important because if they are, that's how change actually occurs. Advertisement     What's next?I'm not going anywhere. I'm back in the Central Valley, and I'm starting to reconnect with stories here, focusing locally again. I'm not going to rule out the idea that I'm going to begin traveling again, but for right now, I want to still maintain these roots. It's just what feels right. That makes sense.Any final things about this book that I didn't talk about that you want to address?There's a history of poverty that I really want to convey, and I want to make it clear that this does not occur kind of in a vacuum. And it does not occur by someone coming in from outside. This is coming from someone who's been on the inside of these communities for a long time. I kind of dedicated my life to doing that here.This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.
"
427,"The former Disney Channel actor has spent the past few decades unpacking the trauma of being a child star. Now, with a new confessional YouTube channel, she’s cashing in.","


The Christy Carlson Romano who greeted me at the door of her Austin home wasn’t the Disney Channel teen whom millions of millennials grew up watching in the early 2000s. She also wasn’t the YouTuber who has gone viral multiple times over the past several months for oddly compelling walking confessional videos where the 37-year-old, clad in tight athleisure, spills her unfiltered thoughts on heavy topics like child stardom, abusive stage parents, and her history with alcoholism and an eating disorder.The Romano I met looked like an average suburban mom. Wearing a Mickey Mouse sweatshirt and jeans, she let me into her house from a porch filled with Halloween decorations. We walked past the living room, where there was a huge dry-erase calendar filled with the schedules for her two daughters, Isabella and Sophia. A black cat winded its way through my legs as Romano offered me seltzer from her fridge.We were a long way from Hollywood, where Romano found fame starring in Even Stevens and Kim Possible, and from New York City, where she got her start acting on Broadway and once played Belle in Beauty and the Beast. But Romano has never felt so balanced. “I’m happy to be here,” she said of her new hometown. “I’m so grateful to be in a place that I feel like is neutral and I don’t have to think about.”She had been posting on YouTube since 2019, but her new videos have vaulted her from relative obscurity to almost-weekly coverage in the tabloids. In “How Stage Moms Destroy Childhoods,” she talks about seeing her fellow child stars being mistreated and even abused by their parents. In “How I Lost All My Money,” she reveals that she wasted all of the millions of dollars she had made as a child actor and had to start basically from scratch financially as an adult. In “How Psychics Scammed Me Out of $60,000,” she tells the story about how she, well, got scammed out of $60,000 by psychics.Now, though, Romano seems to be thriving. She and her husband, Brendan Rooney, moved to Austin from Orange County, California, in 2020. Here, she feels free from the stress of show business, that all-consuming desperate sense that if she wasn’t hustling for her next big break, she was failing.“If I’m in California, I’m wondering if I’m going to get an audition,” Romano said as we sat on her back deck. “I’m like, OK, I’m here. Do I need to meet with my agent? What do I need to do?”Romano started working as an actor when she was 6 years old and continued throughout most of her childhood, commuting from Connecticut to New York City for auditions throughout elementary and middle school and skipping high school for Even Stevens and Kim Possible.
 


As an adolescent, she yearned to be your basic, average girl but got even more famous instead. Now Romano has a chance to finally live her life on her own terms, making the content she wants to make without having to play by the rules of “the industry,” as she calls it. Romano has found a niche in mining her own notoriety, opening up about her experiences and sharing them with the masses — even the unflattering parts.“It’s a fine line between cashing in and selling out,” she acknowledged.In the process, she’s working through and addressing what growing up in the public eye did to her mental health and raising awareness for what being a child star is really like. “Time is ticking,” she said. “I’ve waited for too long.” YouTube allows her to get to know her audience extremely well, down to what content they really want. “I know so much about my analytics, and I’m learning so much about the community out there. And so it’s cool how connected you can actually be.”Her goal? Stacking cash, to give her girls the thing she desperately craved for years: stability.“This is giving me the freedom to enjoy my life with my girls. If I had to be on a set all day and I was there for 12 hours a day, I would literally lose their childhood,” she said. “I wouldn’t be able to be there for them. The way that I want to be is sort of like this working stay-at-home mom. And so I’m kind of getting the best of both worlds.”
 


One of the first things Romano brought up as we settled into our conversation wasn’t YouTube, or the Disney Channel, or her headline-making revelations. It was dance.Specifically, dance classes for children. Romano is starting to sign up her daughters, ages 2 and 4, for activities, including nursery school and swim class. Inevitably for little girls in suburban America, dance is one of them.It’s a seemingly simple decision, but Romano agonized over it, describing the process as “triggering.” Dance classes were how she eventually became a child star. One minute, it seemed, she was tagging along to her older sisters’ dance competitions, and then, suddenly, she was on Broadway.“I was like, ‘Am I going to do this? Like, is the train leaving the station?’” she told me.In 1998, the New York Daily News wrote a feature highlighting her life as a teen Broadway star. Romano, then 14, had been playing Mary Phagan, a murder victim, in the Lincoln Center musical Parade. The Daily News painted her as a precocious ingenue with a Hannah Montana–esque lifestyle, dazzling audiences nightly before racing back home to suburban Connecticut to attend high school as a first-year student. Advertisement  “I’ve been maintaining a 95 average, too,” the newspaper quoted Romano as saying, “proudly.”According to Romano, this characterization was a facade. In reality, Romano said she never was a normal kid.She told me that her mother had tried to get all of her children into performing, but none of Romano’s three older siblings, who were teenagers when they dabbled in the business, really had much success or enthusiasm for it. Only Romano, driven and eager to please, took to the industry from an early age. At age 6, she was appearing in Annie at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta and soon after booked small roles in television shows and movies (she played a trick-or-treater in Woody Allen’s 1996 movie Everyone Says I Love You).
 


It didn’t hit Romano how young she had really been when she started her career until her own daughters were born. As her oldest, Isabella, has gotten closer to the age at which Romano started seriously pursuing acting, she has realized how little control she had over the decision to become a child star, which had a domino effect on her entire life.“It’s crazy to think of a child’s childhood essentially being completely derailed,” she told me.In one of her videos, Romano said she only believes parents should seek out acting opportunities if it is an “organic” dream of their children. Was she one of those children? She seems unsure. Instead, Romano remembers her biggest motivator being a desire to please the adults around her. She enjoyed performing, but what was most gratifying was attending auditions and getting immediate positive feedback.“The thing that I remember the most is making people smile,” she said.As her career began to take off, Romano attended the Professional Children’s School in Manhattan. A distinct childhood memory is the extensive time she spent on trains with her mother, making the two-hour trip between school and home in Milford, Connecticut. Romano said this left her with a lifelong feeling of being transient, with no place where she truly belonged. In hindsight, she said, that had a real effect on her young psyche.“I wasn’t good with change, but I was pushed into change my whole life,” she said. “And so that’s why I was always craving normalcy.”At school with her fellow child actors, Romano dealt with the all-consuming drive to be famous and compete with her peers. When she returned home to the suburbs, she wanted to fit in with her three siblings, who were living relatively average lives, and, she speculates, had a hard time dealing with the fact they were not enjoying the same level of acting success. She also wanted to form real, lasting friendships back home. So that first year at a public high school was everything for her, including a chance to finally put down roots.“I cherish that year so much because I begged my mom to let me go to a normal high school,” she said.That taste of a normal life was fleeting. Parade closed due to budgetary issues, and Romano said her agent asked her to come out to Los Angeles to audition for pilot season. Soon after, she got the news every child star hopes for: She had landed the leading role in a Disney Channel series, Even Stevens. Romano, at 16, would be playing Ren Stevens, a popular and high-achieving eighth-grader who deals with hijinks from her younger, goofy brother Louis, played by a then-unknown Shia LaBeouf. (In 2021, his former girlfriend FKA Twigs sued LaBeouf, accusing him of sexual battery and assault. In response to a New York Times article about the suit and allegations that other women have made against him, LaBeouf claimed that “many of these allegations aren’t true” but said he owed the women “the opportunity to air their statements publicly and accept accountability for those things I have done.”)
 


After landing the role of a lifetime, Romano was devastated. She had finally begun to carve out a space for herself in Connecticut, was dating a boy she was excited about, and was “super sad” about leaving her entire family behind. Her life had seemed like it was starting, and now it was all being taken away.“I’ve never really unpacked how that must have felt, but I know that it was very traumatizing,” she said.If she was so unhappy, though, why didn’t she just quit? Sure, her mom always told her if it wasn’t fun anymore she could stop, but Romano said she felt deep down it wasn’t that simple. (I reached out to Romano’s mother for comment both directly and through Romano’s publicist. I was told that her mother was unable to speak to me about what she recalls from this time period.)“My mom and I became a team ... and so I felt like I couldn’t let my teammate down,” she said. “And that might actually not have been the true case. I think my mom would have been just fine if I had stopped doing this. … I didn’t really know whether or not stopping was a true thing to do, but it felt like I’d be letting her down.” Advertisement  So she went, moving across the country with her mother to Los Angeles. When she arrived, she became part of Disney’s stable of teenage actors who would go on to become some of the most recognizable of the early 2000s: Hilary Duff, Raven-Symoné, and of course, LaBeouf. And while being on Disney Channel was nothing like being a normal high school student, some aspects of it felt like jockeying for a seat at the popular table.Lizzie McGuire premiered the year after Even Stevens, and soon became a huge hit.“We did have to compete a little bit with the Lizzie McGuire show,” she said.Even Stevens never reached the success of Lizzie McGuire, although Romano’s next project, the animated Kim Possible, got better ratings. Romano’s profile also rose when she appeared alongside Duff in the 2002 Disney Channel original movie, Cadet Kelly, which has since developed a cult following.
 


Still, Romano describes herself as somewhat of an outsider. As their shows took off, Duff and other Disney stars like Lindsay Lohan became more famous, releasing albums and gracing the covers of magazines and gossip columns. “I wasn’t trying to be a pop star right off the bat,” she said. “Hilary and Lindsay, and even Raven, I think they had a lot of big plans and I had no big plans. I was really just trying to go to college.”For many teens from that generation, the lives of Disney stars became, as Romano put it, almost like a reality show. But Romano was never really in the tabloids.“I wasn’t invited to the party,” she said. “I don’t have a problem with it, but I legitimately at the time felt like I must not be interesting because [there just wasn’t] anything dramatic going on in my life.”
 


As Romano tells it, she hung around with some of her Even Stevens castmates but didn’t form any deep, lasting friendships.Her most popular confessional video, “Why I Don’t Talk to Shia LaBeouf,” has 1.8 million views, but doesn’t really divulge any gossip, mainly because, it seems, Romano and LaBeouf never had more than a surface-level relationship.Romano didn’t want to talk about the allegations against LaBeouf to me, saying she has avoided speaking publicly on it because she just wanted to address “how I knew him.” She said, though, that she knew he had a bad home life, that was worse than even most child stars. “I didn’t see it firsthand, but I knew it was happening and I could hear it happening and I could sense it happening,” she said. But, she added, she had her “own shit going on.” In the video, Romano says that while they were more coworkers than friends, she regrets not giving LaBeouf “a little more time and energy and love,” as she reflects on what he was dealing with behind the scenes.When Even Stevens wrapped, Romano had a choice to make. She had landed a role in a pilot on a network show, and she had also been accepted to Barnard College in New York. When the pilot ultimately didn’t work out, Romano made a decision that her agent questioned at the time: She decided to go to school. The choice felt like a revelation, something that she had chosen to do on her own, without worrying about what people in the industry thought.“If there’s one thing I hate is waiting around for Hollywood to decide what to do with you,” she said. “It’s a killer of life.”For years her life had been dictated by her career. She learned how to ride a bike for a commercial, not on her block for pleasure. If she wanted to try any extreme sports, like skiing or snowboarding, she told me she had to get clearance from the production. If she injured her face or broke a bone, she could create headaches for a whole team of people. Her body wasn’t her own.“There’s all these considerations, but not for your well-being — they’re for the well-being of the industry,” she said. “It’s basically, almost like you’re in the military, your body belongs to Hollywood, and … that never sat well with me.”Now, she said, her body and her life would finally belong to her.
 


Still, Romano said her initial college experience didn’t go so well. She felt so desperate to be normal, she dove right into what she thought she was supposed to do, living in the Barnard dorms. She dated a star athlete for a few months, but when they broke up, she felt “targeted” by others in his social circle. She speculates that most young women would have been able to navigate that situation, but she felt rocked by it.“I was pretty traumatized from school social hierarchy stuff, that’s pretty normal, but it would [have been] more normal if I had been in high school and dealt with it,” she said. “In college, it didn’t help me learn. I was super distracted.”When she had the opportunity to audition for Belle in Beauty and the Beast on Broadway, she jumped at it. She got the part in 2004 and dropped out of school. After the show wrapped, she spent about five years trying to get back into acting, taking parts in made-for-television movies and voice-acting work, and even working as a traveling acting coach.
 


It was a turbulent time. At 21, she said, she told her mom, who had worked closely with her on her career up until that point, they could no longer work together, and the two didn’t speak for a year. She felt directionless and was more focused on partying and dating than figuring out what she wanted to do with her life. She wasted her hard-earned money and drank too much. When she went to auditions, she felt angry and entitled. How could she still be grinding so hard to make a living when she had sacrificed so much for this career? She described the period as a sort of “narcissistic purgatory.”“I think I started to kind of hate this business of acting,” she said.So at 26, she parted ways with her agents and went back to school at Columbia University. There she met her husband. Rooney was also a later-in-life student, attending college on the GI Bill after having served in the military. She said he had no idea who she was when they met. Their lives couldn’t have been more different, but their experiences — child stardom and military service — were surprisingly congruent. Advertisement  
 


“Our baggage matched each other’s baggage,” she said. “We could blend our baggage set together and just roll along with each other to the next stop.”Still, even after getting her degree in film, with an eye to directing and producing, Romano struggled to figure out how to work in the industry on her own terms. She moved back to California with Rooney, so he could attend the American Film Institute, and “tried a lot of different things.” She even tried interning at ABC Studios, Disney’s parent company, which led to some awkward encounters.“I was literally sitting at the receptionist desk and the ABC studio executives would come by and they’d be like … ‘Aren’t you that girl?’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah,’” she said, describing it as “so fucking weird.”Despite the awkwardness, Romano found the experience empowering. She learned aspects of the business she had never understood when she was a child actor and felt like she was working toward something.“I felt really proud of myself, in a weird way, to show them that I was still alive,” she said. “Yeah, I was at the receptionist desk, but I’m still here. It was a quiet … ‘fuck you’ to them. I’m still here. You’re not going to forget me.”As much as Romano speaks out online about the bad parts of Hollywood and works outside the industry, she still seems to want to be part of it. She has nothing but good things to say about Disney as a company and tells me she’s nervous she would come off as bitter or a “whistleblower” in this piece. “I still believe in the wholesomeness of what Disney represents, and I don’t think that I would ever speak negatively about Disney or even Disney Channel,” she said. She added that she would jump at the chance to do an Even Stevens or Kim Possible reboot if the project felt right: “I’m always willing to do the work and work hard for Disney,” she says.But Romano couldn’t just wait around for Disney to notice her. As her 30s approached, she began to consider other ways to make money, and she found Comic-Con. It turned out that a lot of nostalgic millennials were curious about what stars like her were up to now. It was an easy and fulfilling way to make money, and also a revelation. She and Rooney discussed how she could tap into this fanbase that she hadn’t realized she had been leaving on the table.“We would sit there like, This seems to be an overwhelming amount of people wondering what I’m up to,” she said.
 


The answer to how to tap into that fan interest was obvious: social media. Prior to 2016, Romano’s Instagram account had mainly consisted of photos of herself on set for her various projects, and she didn’t have that many followers. Once she got pregnant with Isabella that year, though, she started to wonder if she had an opportunity to make money off her personal brand. Slowly but surely, she said, she began to understand the algorithm and “started to see what being a part of the influencer game meant.” She shared more of her family, got better at her photo game, and began to think about who her demographic could be. She started treating her social media as a business and soon got her first deal with a baby brand.“Because of that, I was able to move from a small condo in West Hollywood and into a house in Orange County,” she said. “And I was ready to have my first baby because of this endorsement.”For the first time in a long time, Romano felt financially secure. It was, she said, a “super cool” feeling.“When your whole life, you’re white-knuckling what the next chapter of your life is going to be ... it’s just kind of a not fun existence,” she said. “That’s why people tell people not to act.”Now though, with content creation? “The sky’s the limit,” she said.Romano officially launched her YouTube channel in June 2019 with a series called “Christy’s Kitchen Throwback.” Shortly before launching, she wrote an essay in Teen Vogue, titled “Christy Carlson Romano: My Private Breakdown,” describing many of the struggles she has since shared on YouTube, reintroducing herself to fans after a decade out of the spotlight, and promoting her channel as her comeback.“The beauty of the entertainment industry today is that you can create what you want to, a privilege that we didn’t have when I was coming up,” she wrote at the time. “With YouTube and the other social media platforms, smart, savvy people with talent can do it all themselves.”
 


The series took a formula Romano knew had potential from her Comic-Con days — catching up with child Disney channel stars — and married it with her own enjoyment of cooking. She had some viral hits; one video, where she made a recipe from Kim Possible with her former costar Will Friedle and dished on the series, got more than 2.5 million views. However, subsequent videos failed to match its success, even though they featured Disney favorites like Jason Earles from Hannah Montana and Sabrina Bryan from The Cheetah Girls. Romano seemed particularly bummed that a video re-creating the scene featuring “We Went to the Moon in 1969” from Even Stevens didn’t perform either.By this point, Rooney had graduated from the American Film Institute with an MFA in screenwriting, and he began to work closely with Romano on her YouTube channel. Romano credited Rooney as much of the brains behind her content, saying he has a great mind for “forecasting trends.”The couple dabbled in all types of content. They did challenge videos, and Romano shared her makeup routine and lifestyle tips. They tried family vlogging, and Romano set up verified Instagram accounts for her daughters (she eventually grew uncomfortable with them being public and made them private). She and Rooney even spent a lot of money on videos where they just gave cash to random people (“I Gave a Fan as Much Cash as They Could Catch,” “I Gave $5000 to Whoever Recognized Me From Disney Channel), for little return. Advertisement  After the family moved to Austin in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic (for the slower pace of life and to escape wildfire season), it became difficult to film the kitchen series with guests. At one point, Rooney and Romano discussed abandoning YouTube altogether, to focus on Instagram and TikTok, where it is easier to grow an audience. But they decided to press on. She had been finding success with mental health– and advice-themed TikToks and speculated that her audience liked the “vulnerability” of that content.“And so Brendan had an idea,” she said. “We fused together the concept of this ‘big sister in mental health,’ ‘Christy’s talking about her life’ thing. Memoir.”In August, she posted the first of these videos, “The Truth About the Disney Channel,” in a style that would become her signature. She walks on the trails near her home, speaking directly to the camera about her life in a seemingly stream of consciousness, off-the-cuff manner (Romano insisted to me that “99% of the time,” the videos are not scripted but her publicist declined to let me observe her film one). This first one got more than 400,000 views. Since then, she has found a large amount of success, getting written up frequently in the tabloids for her revelations and getting hundreds of thousands of views on her channel (her video about LaBeouf has the highest number, with more than 1.8 million). Advertisement     Finally, Romano was squarely back in the public eye. But she was gaining success by mining her own life and trauma, and by playing into some of the more cringe aspects of YouTube culture, like headlines that are clearly clickbait (“How Katy Perry Got My Record Deal” oversells the real story a bit).Romano shrugs about that aspect. Her attitude seems to be: Don’t hate the player, hate the game.“That’s the only way to get noticed,” she said, then corrected herself. “It’s not the only way to get noticed, but it’s the quickest way to get noticed.”The reactions to her videos generate more complicated feelings. She sees the tweets poking fun at her revelations, and some of them make her feel “shitty.” After living without public scrutiny for so long, being back in the conversation can feel triggering at times, but she’s learning to live with it. Advertisement     “You just have to kind of put your blinders on and just focus on the success of what you’re doing,” she said. “It’s teaching me a lot. So while it is triggering, I think it’s also an exercise in acceptance.”She also noted that, this time, it’s what she has chosen.“I had to check in with myself and say, ‘Is this worth it?’” she said. “And it is worth it because what I never did before was have an authentic point of view, and it’s what I regret probably most in my career. ... Now I’ve got a story. And so in giving that story a platform ... I can start again.”
 


Obviously, Romano eventually will run out of childhood stories to mine, although she told me she has many more ideas in the bag. (Shortly after our chat, she released two back-to-back: “What Donald Trump Is Really Like” and “What Bill Clinton Is Really Like.”) Advertisement     But after her story well runs dry, what’s next for Romano and her channel? She said her goal is to get to a million YouTube subscribers and to continue to grow her audience. The hope is that while people may go to her social media accounts for the nostalgia videos or confessionals, eventually they will stay for her. Leaning into being a lifestyle influencer, what Romano called the “Chrissy Teigen part of my life,” has been fun and fulfilling.“When I get to do that, I actually feel like, my gosh, I am performing again, like, I’m having fun putting these clothes on and putting this image out there,” she said. “For now that’s ... that’s good.”She also said she isn’t done with Hollywood, per se, but she wants to do things on her own terms. Rooney is saving up to start his own agency for social media and trend forecasting, and the plan is for it to eventually have a film arm. The couple would love to make their own feature films, and Romano would love to direct or produce (she’s especially interested in family films). She hasn’t completely ruled out acting again, although, she noted, “I can’t say that people are going to come to me to be in their films.”
 


“I used to love acting,” she said. “I do love acting. I don’t love the business of getting a job in acting. I think it’s just a racket.”For now, Romano is focused on simple things. She and Rooney are getting to the place now where, she said, “their front door is about as big as their back door,” meaning that they are bringing in about as much money as they are spending. They are leasing their current Austin home, but they are hoping to save up enough to be able to build their own house further from the city. Romano said she now has a great relationship with her mother, who recently moved to Austin to be closer to them and helps out with the girls.There’s one burning question I can’t get out of my head. There’s no way she would ever let her daughters become child actors, right?Her answer surprised me. Romano doesn’t want her kids to act, but it’s complicated because she knows that it could be something they want to do. She could use her connections, get Isabella or Sophia an agent, and start booking them work. It’s not what she wants, and the thought terrifies her. But if it’s their dream? Maybe she couldn’t say no.“I don’t really want it for them, and I will tell them that,” she said, sighing.She said that when she looks at her girls, with their blonde hair and huge blue eyes, she realizes how successful they probably would be in the industry. That’s what makes it so hard and so scary. She’s not ready for one of her daughters to tell her they want to be just like her. “I’m not ready for that conversation and that concept,” she said. “If I’m not ready, how can I be a good support system for her? … The last thing I want is to put her in a business and then feel trepidatious or cautious ... I wouldn’t want to do that to her.”“Maybe it will never come!” I suggested. “Maybe she just will want to do soccer?”“That’d be great,” Romano said, laughing, “because mostly I just don’t want to have to relive this experience. I just want to move on, you know. I want to figure out how to bottle the joy that I have right now, making content that makes people happy … I know that I have goals, but like ... if I could be here in five years, I’d be happy for that too.” ●
"
428,"Following weeks of speculation, Kim and Pete appeared to confirm that they’re dating with some PDA days after he flew to LA to celebrate his birthday with her and her family.","It seems a lot like Kanye West should start ~keeping up~ with Kim Kardashian’s dating life, because things just got a little complicated. After weeks of mounting speculation, Kim and Pete Davidson appear to have confirmed once and for all that, yes, they really are a thing. So, in case you need a reminder of what brings us here, buckle up and let’s go back to the start. As you may remember, Kim hosted Saturday Night Live back in October, which is — we assume — how she wound up getting friendly with Pete, who is a regular cast member on the show. Pete, as you may have heard, has a bit of a reputation for seemingly dating some of Hollywood’s most sought after women — Ariana Grande, Kaia Gerber, Kate Beckinsale, and Phoebe Dynevor, just to name a few. And so, when Kim and Pete shared a kiss in character as Jasmine and Aladdin during a sketch on the show, fans began to get excited about the prospect of connection between the two. Which is why fans went pretty wild a few weeks later when photographs of Pete and Kim holding hands at a theme park surfaced online on Oct. 30. From that moment on, fans quickly latched onto the idea of Kim and Pete becoming this year’s breakout celeb couple, with fans growing more and more excited in the following weeks after they were spotted out on dates in both Kim’s hometown of Los Angeles and Pete’s native New York. And despite conflicting reports that they’re simply “just friends,” things stepped up a level this week when Pete, who lives in NYC, came to LA to celebrate his birthday with Kim on Nov. 16. So, while it’s not out of the question that two “friends” might celebrate a birthday together, fans had reason to believe things might be more serious than they had first seemed when it was reported that the festivities took place in Palm Springs at the home of none other than Kris Jenner, Kim’s mom. And if the family affair by itself wasn’t enough, Kim, Pete, and Kris were all dressed in matching Skims pajamas from Kim’s new collection. If matching loungewear with the in-laws doesn’t scream long-term commitment, what does? Which brings us to now, and, at long last, we finally have the ~Kete~ (or Pim?) confirmation that we’ve been waiting for. Seemingly putting speculation to rest, Kim and Pete were photographed on Wednesday with beaming smiles as they walked hand in hand in Palm Springs. In the new pics, Pete appeared to be sporting the same Skims pajamas he had been photographed in on his birthday, while Kim opted for an uncharacteristically low-key ensemble consisting of gray sweatpants and a white bodysuit as they made a trip to a convenience store near Kris’s home. Later in the day, Pete was snapped — still in his Skims PJ’s, no less — boarding a flight back to New York, while Kim stayed put in Palm Springs. Putting aside the fact that this whole thing slightly seems like it could also be a carefully orchestrated advert for the Skims holiday collection, E! News reported yesterday that Kim and Pete are officially an item, and apparently they couldn’t be happier. “They are really happy and seeing where it goes,” a source close to the new couple revealed. “Pete has told her he doesn't want to see anyone else,"" the insider went on, before adding that Kim apparently feels the same. “Kim is smitten over him and it's very exciting to her.” “She is telling some people they aren't super serious, but she isn't seeing anyone else,” they continued. “She's trying to not make a big deal about it but is super into him.” The source also described Pete’s invite to Kris’s Palm Springs home as a “huge deal,” adding that “everyone is happy for her.” So, now that we’re up to speed with Kim and Pete, let’s bring Kanye into the equation. In the unlikely event that you aren’t aware, Kanye and Kim used to be married. And while she did file for divorce back in February, let’s just say that their split hasn’t exactly been clear-cut. With their wedding dress reunion at one of Kanye’s Donda listening parties, his cryptic lyrics about still being in love with her, and their numerous dinner dates, fans had plenty of reasons to speculate that Kim and Kanye’s split might have changed its course in recent months. However, sources close to the family have maintained that the divorce is still on, stating that Kim and Kanye are not getting back together but instead are “privately working on rebuilding the foundation of their relationship” to ensure a “healthy and sturdy foundation of love and support” for their four children, North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm. And so, with that, and Kim’s new SNL love interest, fans had pretty much ruled out the possibility of a Kimye reunion any time soon — when along came Kanye. In case you missed it, Kanye spoke out about his divorce from Kim for the very first time earlier this month, and let’s just say, we weren’t quite expecting ~this~. Speaking candidly on a now-viral episode of the Drink Champs podcast on Nov. 5, Kanye began by insisting that Kim is “still [his] wife” before revealing that he has “never even seen” any divorce paperwork. And after months of rife speculation, Kanye went on to confirm once and for all that he hopes to rekindle things with Kim and explained that their four children want to see them get back together, too. “My kids want they parents to stay together. …I want us to be together,” he said, before hinting that “the media” is preventing him and Kim from making things work. “But if you look at the media, that’s not what they promoting. That’s not what they want. They want it to be a new wedding, a new episode, a new TV show,” he said, perhaps alluding to past conflict about Kim’s reality show lifestyle. Interestingly, Kanye even went on to imply that their divorce was encouraged by Kim’s publicist, who he claimed was influencing decisions in their marriage. “And then they have people all around in my wife’s ear,” he said of Kim’s team. “That publicist that’s next to her, I don’t fuck with her.” So, while he didn’t directly address Kim’s links to Pete, it has been reported elsewhere that the rapper isn’t happy about the new romance. Earlier this month, sources close to Kanye claimed that he did not like the initial photos of Kim and Pete holding hands in October and alleged that he asked Kim to “please refrain” from showing PDA until their divorce is finalized. “Kanye was really put off by Kim holding hands with Pete and he did not like it at all,” a source close to the family revealed. “He asked Kim to ‘please refrain’ from showing public displays of affection with anyone until their divorced is finalized.” They continued, “He told her that it doesn’t look good for their family and it doesn’t look good for her, or in the ‘eyes of God.’” Well, if those quotes are anything to go by, it seems like Kanye probably won’t be happy about Kim and Pete’s most recent hand-holding escapade. And to add yet ~another~ layer of complication, it’s also been widely reported that Kanye is seeing someone new as well. In case you haven’t heard, Kanye is reportedly dating a 22-year-old model named Vinetria. And while we don’t know all that much about her or the alleged relationship, it appears that she and Kanye aren’t hiding anything given that they were photographed sitting courtside at a basketball game a few weeks ago. Page Six also reported that Vinetria was present in Miami for Kanye’s appearance on the Drink Champs podcast where he said he wanted to get back together with Kim, which only prompts more questions about the nature of her relationship with the rapper. So, with all that in mind, what initially appeared to be a love triangle between Kim, Kanye, and Pete now might actually be more of a love... square? And while we wait patiently for Kanye’s thoughts on Kim and Pete’s new relationship status, I think we can probably rule out the possibility of a double date."
429,"It’s a major step for President Biden’s signature legislation, but passage through the Senate is far from a sure thing.","


WASHINGTON — After months of negotiations, the House of Representatives has passed the Build Back Better Act, the Democrats’ far-ranging social program and climate change bill. But the bill could be significantly altered in the Senate, where it faces major hurdles.The House passed the Build Back Better Act in a near party-line vote of 220–213. Every Republican voted against the bill, while every Democrat supported it except for Maine Rep. Jared Golden.It’s a major leap forward for a package that includes practically every major social and environmental action Democrats plan to pass this year. It includes universal prekindergarten, four weeks of paid family leave, $3,600 per year child tax credits, and hundreds of billions of dollars toward combating climate change. Advertisement     “The Build Back Better agenda creates jobs, secures tax cuts for the middle class, lowers costs for families while making the wealthiest pay their fair share,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shortly before the vote.The bill now goes to the Senate, where passage is far from a sure thing.The House was supposed to hold just 20 minutes of debate on the bill Thursday evening, but Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy launched an eight-and-a-half hour speech railing against it. It is believed to be the longest speech in the history of the chamber, breaking Pelosi’s previous record of around eight hours. McCarthy finished after 5 a.m. Friday, pushing the vote to later that morning. Despite McCarthy’s history-making performance, the ultimate results were the same.The House vote came after the Congressional Budget Office estimated the Democrats’ efforts to tax the rich will not be enough to fully pay for the bill’s almost $2 trillion of spending over the next decade.The CBO found that the bill as currently written would add $160 billion to the national debt over 10 years. But that gap between costs and revenues was close enough that centrist Democrats agreed to vote to move the package forward.All sides anticipate further changes will be made to the bill. Progressives expect Sens. Bernie Sanders, Jon Tester, Bob Menendez, and others to scale back federal deductions for state and local taxes, known as SALT. As currently written, the SALT provisions disproportionately benefit wealthy earners. The issue has split progressives, who are mortified that their bill may result in a tax cut for many millionaires, and certain Democrats from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California who are trying to lower their constituents’ tax bills.“It’s bullshit that we would even think about any kind of tax cut for the wealthy in this,” Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan said. ""The whole program here is to put money in the pockets of working people.""Progressive priorities in the bill — paid family leave in particular — may also soon be on the chopping block in the Senate, due to resistance from Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. The party’s 50–50 majority in that chamber (Vice President Kamala Harris holds the tie-breaking vote) means any single senator can force changes to the bill by threatening not to support it. Advertisement     Democrats have had to continually rewrite the bill as members fought for or against certain items. The original plan to raise income and capital gains taxes on the rich, as well as the corporate tax rate for large businesses, was blocked by Sinema. The party rebounded by drafting a tax surcharge on people making more than $10 million in income per year.Some Democrats had pushed for a “billionaire’s tax” on capital gains growth because the ultrawealthy frequently grow their fortunes through stocks and assets while drawing little salary. That proposal never got off the ground.Manchin has repeatedly expressed concerns that the size of the package may contribute to inflation. While he has offered vague support for the framework of the bill, he notably has not agreed to support a new paid family leave program.Any changes the Senate makes would eventually need to be agreed to by the House. Getting everyone on the same page could take weeks.The bill also expands Affordable Care Act subsidies to help more people to purchase health insurance. The CBO projects this measure would lead to 1.4 million more people being covered. It also expands Medicare to cover hearing and allows Medicare to directly negotiate the prices of some drugs. The CBO projects these negotiations will save the government $79 billion over the next decade.Democrats are using a special congressional process known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill through the Senate without any Republican votes. Normally, bills are vulnerable to a filibuster unless 60 senators vote to override. Under reconciliation, a bill can be passed with a simple majority but faces other constraints in how it must be designed.

430,"Adele is — finally — back with a new album, and this time she’s fully in control.","


Less than 30 seconds into Adele’s 73 Questions, a popular Vogue video series, the singer makes the reason for the interview crystal clear. “How is Adele doing these days?” Joe Sabia, the interviewer and creator of the series, asks. “I’m great. I’m really great. I’m excited. I’m about to put my new album out,” Adele says. “And I’d assume that’s the thing you’re most excited about in life right now,” Sabia adds — but before the statement completely leaves his lips, Adele quickly interjects: ""It is. And that's why you're here."" Her face sports an expression that seems to say Why else would I be doing this? before immediately returning to a bright, warm smile.Now that 30 — the best work of her career thus far — is out Friday, it’s easy to understand why Adele, a reluctant celebrity, has been on such a concentrated media blitz. In early October, she became the first person to grace the covers of both American and British Vogue in the same month, with accompanying profiles from two different writers and exquisite photo shoots by veteran photographers Alasdair McLellan and Steven Meisel. Then followed a Rolling Stone cover story and Adele’s first-ever Instagram Live; she took questions from fans about her new music and then sent everyone into a frenzy when she played a snippet of her brand-new single “Easy on Me” before its mid-October release date. Advertisement     But the event that truly heralded her highly anticipated return was Sunday night’s CBS special, titled Adele: One Night Only. Ten million people tuned in to watch the singer give a tell-all interview to none other than Oprah. The program alternated between intimate moments in Oprah’s rose garden and a prerecorded live performance at Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. The singer was outfitted in a custom black Schiaparelli haute couture dress, and the special was complete with stunning views of the city as late evening transitioned into night. A slate of A-list celebrities in attendance, including Lizzo, Drake, Tracee Ellis Ross, and Melissa McCarthy. During the interview, Adele opened up about her divorce from Simon Konecki, the toll the split took on their son, 9-year-old Angelo, her changing physical appearance, and, of course, the new music.A promotional tour isn’t a novel undertaking for a celebrity by any means, but the way Adele has chosen to conduct her public reemergence says a lot. “I mean, I have to sort of gear myself up to be famous again, which famously I don’t really like being,” Adele told British Vogue. In just one sentence, the typically publicity-shy singer epitomizes her approach to the celebrity machine. She understands that it’s an act, a performance — one she doesn’t like doing and yet excels at. “I’ve got the upper hand on everything. I love it,” she says in that same interview, chatting about how she likes to toy with the press. Adele was already relatable, but as she’s gotten further into her career, she has mastered the art of providing the public with just enough information to satisfy the demands of being a star without compromising herself or her craft in the process. Impressively, with 30, a revelatory and emotionally exposed album, she has managed to toe the line between accessibility and mystery, all while keeping people’s attention about what matters most: her talent.
 


When “Easy on Me,” the lead single from 30, debuted, I admit I was unimpressed. This Adele seemed much more restrained than past iterations. The song lacked a memorable melody, and after waiting six years for new music, I was dissatisfied. A big, soaring song like “Hello” is what I’d been emotionally longing for, something I could dramatize while tipsy at a karaoke outing. But the decision to go against fans’ expectations was deliberate. “That song catapulted me in fame to another level that I don’t want to happen again,” Adele told American Vogue. “I’m not saying I’ve got ‘Hello’s in my pocket. I was just conscious that I didn’t want my story on this album to sound like that.” In an Apple Music interview with Zane Lowe, she talked about making music for “the 30- and 40-year-olds that are all committing to themselves and doing therapy.” She added, “That’s my vibe.” Adele knows herself. She doesn’t need a gimmick for her music to reach people, and she’s acutely aware, especially at this point in her life, of what she does and does not want. It’s this fearless dedication to herself and her own happiness that’s led her to somehow outdo herself with 30, which is lyrically devastating and sonically more interesting than anything she has ever done.Take “Strangers by Nature,” which opens the 12-track album. It’s a dreamlike song, with gorgeous strings that seduce the ears like a lullaby, reminiscent of something you might hear in a 1960s Disney musical. Produced by Ludwig Göransson, it’s actually an homage to Judy Garland. There’s a feeling of majesty and poignancy, with lyrics like “I'll be taking flowers to the cemetery of my heart / For all of my lovers, in the present and in the dark.” (Adele told Rolling Stone that the track is her way of conceding that she can sometimes be a “hot mess.”) The song ends with a signal that she’s prepared to bare her soul. “Alright then,” she says. “I’m ready.”From there, we're off to “Easy on Me,” which has grown on me since her performance of it during the One Night Only special. In interviews, Adele has described how hard it was to muster the strength to divorce her husband, and how she was afraid of what others might’ve thought. Between this, and the album’s musical and lyrical context, this song really resonates. The album doesn’t let up, going right into “My Little Love,” which is dedicated to her son. It slants more R&B than the other tracks and includes intimate voice notes. “I wanted you to have everything I never had / I'm so sorry if what I've done makes you feel sad,” she sings. A brilliant chorus that reflects the weight of her decision: “I'm holdin' on (Baby) / Mama's got a lot to learn (It's heavy).”
 


“Cry Your Heart Out,” a thumping banger with incisive lyrics written by Adele and record producer Greg Kurstin, whom she worked with on 2015’s “Hello,” is reminiscent of “Right as Rain” from 19. “I created this storm / It’s only fair I have to sit in its rain,” she sings, a line that captures the all-too-real feeling of wallowing in the misery of one’s own making. It’s followed by “Oh My God,” an upbeat ditty cowritten with Kurstin in which Adele expresses the complications of her newer romantic connections. It’s a fun song, one where she conveys both sensuality and recklessness: “But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall / Boy, you give good love, I won't lie / It's what keeps me comin' back even though I'm terrified.”Adele stretches herself in ways that feel incredibly refreshing, like on the Max Martin and Shellback bop “Can I Get It,” one of the album’s many standout tracks. Others include “All Night Parking,” featuring a piano sample from the late jazz composer Erroll Garner, an evocative number about rediscovering what it’s like to fall for someone again: “Every time that you text I want to get on the next flight home / And dream next to you all night long.” Just like the feeling of falling in love, the song, the shortest on the album, leaves you wanting more. The final three tracks are superb too. “Hold On,” which she debuted during Sunday’s special, has a hauntingly gorgeous chorus. “To Be Loved,” which Adele posted to her on Twitter on Wednesday, is terrific. She’s never sounded better or pushed herself further (wait until you hear the ending), and it’s hard to imagine getting through the ballad without shedding a few tears. The album closes with “Love Is a Game,” an instant classic befitting of a great romantic love story — with one’s self.There are no bad songs on the album, but a few, like “I Drink Wine” and “Woman Like Me,” have failed to make a significant impression. Narratively the tracks make sense. The former is “about shedding one’s ego,” she told Rolling Stone; the latter takes digs at an ex-lover. Although the two songs weren’t immediate favorites for me musically, what I did love were the lyrics; they really nail 30’s themes of searching and redefinition. “Why am I obsessin' about the things I can't control? / Why am I seekin' approval from people I don't even know?” she sings on “I Drink Wine.”There’s something special about entering your 30s; it’s a time when you really consider how you want the rest of your life to look and put to bed old and useless notions of how it’s purportedly supposed to be. Adele sincerely opens up about her own life and conflicts during this defining decade, spotlighting a range of emotions — sadness, anger, hope — while consistently playing by her own rules. “I feel like this album is self-destruction, then self-reflection, and then sort of self-redemption,” she said recently. “But I feel ready. I really want people to hear my side of the story this time.” ●

431,The Times said it would immediately challenge the “unconstitutional” order.,"


WASHINGTON — A judge in New York on Thursday took the rare step of temporarily blocking the New York Times from publishing certain documents about the right-wing activist group Project Veritas.The Times planned to immediately challenge the order from Westchester Supreme Court Justice Charles Wood, arguing that it was “prior restraint” that violated decades of First Amendment protections for the press, according to a statement from executive editor Dean Baquet. Advertisement     ""This ruling is unconstitutional and sets a dangerous precedent. When a court silences journalism, it fails its citizens and undermines their right to know. The Supreme Court made that clear in the Pentagon Papers case, a landmark ruling against prior restraint blocking the publication of newsworthy journalism. That principle clearly applies here. We are seeking an immediate review of this decision,” Baquet said.Thursday’s order was styled as a temporary prohibition in advance of a potentially even more explosive First Amendment showdown: Wood halted the Times from publishing the documents at issue while he considers not only a longer-term prohibition, but also whether to order the Times to take down information from a Nov. 11 article.Project Veritas petitioned Wood to step in after the Times published an article on Nov. 11 based on a set of memos the news outlet obtained that were written by a lawyer for Project Veritas, Benjamin Barr. A year ago, Project Veritas had sued the Times for defamation over a separate article about the group’s work. Barr is representing Project Veritas in that litigation, which remains pending, and the group accused the Times of “improperly” trying to get privileged attorney–client communications and then publishing them to “harm and embarrass a litigation adversary.”Wood’s order bars the Times from publishing “any of Project Veritas’ privileged materials” until he rules; he scheduled a hearing for Nov. 23.In a brief initial response to Project Veritas’s request, lawyers for the Times wrote that the group hadn’t presented any evidence that the reporters involved in the story “improperly” obtained the memos, and asked the judge to give the outlet a chance to fully respond before imposing “such a draconian and disfavored restriction.” Advertisement     Project Veritas’s lead attorney Libby Locke disputed in an email to BuzzFeed News that Thursday’s order was an act of prior restraint — “Nonsense,” she wrote — since the Times previously had published a link to the memos. According to an affidavit that Locke filed in court, the link was no longer active.“Here, The Times already published Veritas’ attorney-client privileged communications, and the interim order and more permanent relief sought are narrowly tailored to that misconduct,” Locke wrote in an email to BuzzFeed News.A spokesperson for the Times confirmed in an email to BuzzFeed News that before the story published, “a selection of the documents, which we did not intend to publish, was inadvertently published due to a technical issue and then unpublished.”Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said in a statement that this was the first prior restraint order entered against the Times since the Pentagon Papers case, and called it ""an outrageous affront to the First Amendment.""""Prior restraints — which are orders not to publish — are among the most serious threats to press freedom. The trial court should have never entered this order. If it doesn’t immediately vacate the prior restraint, an appellate court must step in and do so,"" Brown said.

432,"""Because I’m polyamorous, my decision to get on birth control had to go through an unusual chain of command.""","


Desire can make you do strange things, like bike 4 miles in the rain to a cute boy’s doorstep and lie that you were already in the neighborhood; or blow off your responsibilities to follow the same boy home at 3 a.m. because he says you might “get better Lyft app reception” from his bedroom, and you fall for it; or decide to have unprotected sex, in spite of all the sexual health podcasts you’ve ever listened to, you big nerd.Last summer, this was me. A couple months into dating Sam, an indie musician–slash–dog walker with soulful brown eyes, I got that itch — the one that fills your brain with hormones and urges you to forget to wear a condom. I know for some couples who consider themselves perfectly responsible people, this decision can be as simple as having a talk about sexual exclusivity, getting tested, and then getting down to it. Not so for us — because we’re polyamorous, our decision had to go through an unusual chain of command first. Specifically, I had to talk to my partner Charlie, whom I lived with and had been dating for four years, and Daniel, my boyfriend of two years. Sam’s other girlfriend wanted to know how it would affect her, too. Our intimate, personal choice had quickly become something squeamishly bureaucratic. Advertisement  If you think you need a chart just to keep track of this, à la Alice from The L Word, then you're probably not used to hanging around polyamorous people. Polyamory is one popular term for when you date multiple people at the same time, you’re honest about it with everyone, and you think you could fall in love with any or all of them, too. This network of connections dictates almost everything we do together in some way, whether it's a matter of who's having sex with whom, who gets the bigger bedroom on date night, or how the heck you share your time and process your feelings when all of your friends are sleeping with each other.Often, it's not even about sex. You should hear a group of poly people try to divvy up the rights to something as mundane as watching a popular TV show. It’s like, Yes, of course you can have sex with my wife in our bed while I'm out with my girlfriend this evening, but could you please not stream the next episode of Game of Thrones without me there? If you want to do it with one person, it has the potential to affect what you do with everyone else. The same goes for unprotected sex.Polyamorists call the decision to stop using condoms “fluid-bonding.” The act gets a special term because the health consequences of barrier-free sex, particularly intercourse, are certainly higher than, say, simply making out with someone you just met at a party. And many polyamorists think it's common sense to keep a strict limit on whom you're doing it raw with. Advertisement  Some use their fluid-bond status to protect their relationships as much as their health, regarding it as a symbol of status or a marker that they are special. I was a slut, not a romantic, and I didn't want it to be so significant. My loves knew this, but still, they knew I had never done this with someone before, and they had questions.For Charlie, a quiet introvert who relishes his alone time and practiced impeccable, unwavering safer sex (if you can get him talking, he’ll brag about how much fun he can have with a latex glove), the decision to put my sexual health in the hands of a man I’d only known for a few months called into question my sense of self-preservation. And Daniel, my best friend and confidante in all matters since we’d fallen in love a year ago, wanted to know why I had never asked to go barrier-free with him. I thought the answer was obvious: He and his other girlfriend had been fluid-bonding since before I even met them, so the option had never seemed real. Her needs and preferences usually came first, and I didn’t want to step on her toes or let myself be disappointed.And besides, I was frankly never that excited about letting someone come in me, anyway. I was deterred by the logistical headaches of having unprotected sex within a network of other polyamorists, turned off by some of the nitty-gritty physics of it, and reluctant to alter my body with birth control. Until now. Something had changed, and Daniel and Charlie wanted to know what was up with me — the same way they wanted to know where I kept disappearing to at odd hours. Advertisement  It’s easy to forget is that we're always changing — even in relationships; people's desires and preferences are always evolving. When we're lucky we grow together, but it's just as likely that we'll grow apart. When you're polyamorous, you can watch your partner change right in front of you, and you may see them try things they swore they’d never do, with someone new. It can be hard to keep up, and harder still not to get jealous of that new person for connecting with this hidden, undiscovered part of your lover whom you already thought you knew inside and out.This is why perfectly content mono people cheat on their partners. As renowned psychotherapist Esther Perel noted in the Atlantic last year: To make a long-term relationship work, each partner must be given the space to explore their changing self. As much as we crave closeness and comfort from our committed loves, we also need mystery, novelty, and unpredictability to keep the spark alive. These elements of surprise help us grow and rediscover who we are. In choosing to fluid-bond with Sam, I was choosing to be a different person than the woman Daniel and Charlie expected me to be. In my mind, I didn't choose him over them. I loved them more than ever. I was choosing myself, an individual separate from the couples I normally defined myself by.For monogamous couples, it can be especially hard to keep choosing yourself, to see yourself as a separate and whole being apart from the couple. Polyamory encourages you to practice retaining this individuality over years, because you're not just one half of one couple. You'll have nights when you're cuddling on the couch with six or seven people, and you feel surrounded by love. And you’ll have nights when you're coming home late from a first date, to a dark, empty apartment because everyone else is out for a date night too, and it’s like you’re single again. If I were monogamous, I wouldn't have to explain my sex life with Sam to anyone if I didn’t want to. But again, I had this network of lovers to answer to. And they weren’t convinced I had thought this one through. Advertisement  Sam was newly polyamorous, a term some sensitive artists use to mean “doing whatever I want.” And he had already made some questionable safer sex choices, such as sometimes forgoing condoms with a casual hookup. He also had a little bit of a bad-boy vibe going — tattoos, cigarettes, a thing for staying out til 5 a.m. — and was nothing like anyone I’d been with before. But in spite of some yellow flags, I wanted him, the same way I suddenly wanted to put my day-to-day obligations and responsibilities on hold; to let it get late; to walk around my neighborhood in the middle of the night and look at how the sunflowers catch the amber street light. Maybe you can see where this is going — I had a crush, and after spending years playing by my boyfriends’ rules, I wanted to be a little bit bad, too.No surprise, my doctor marked me down as “high risk” when I went in for my STI test and a birth control consultation. She asked me if my boyfriend had recently had any unprotected sex and I said, “Which one?” She knew that Charlie had a vasectomy, so I patiently explained that it wasn’t him I was getting the IUD for, but another man. “Well, is he currently having unprotected sex with other people right now?” She asked. “I honestly have no clue,” I replied. Charlie came back with me for my IUD appointment, only confusing the doctor more.It’s not unusual for women to bring their boyfriends when they go in for a ParaGard IUD. The procedure is known to be quick but painful, and it can be helpful to have moral support. I fully expected to be going it alone, but to my shock, Charlie and Daniel both offered to take me. It’s no fun to watch your girlfriend writhe with discomfort on an exam table, and furthermore, it's not like they had anything to “gain” from my experience. There’s no less-ugly way to say it — I wanted to protect myself from getting pregnant while raw-dogging someone else. They were uncomfortable, turned off even, and yet, they were still game. If that's not love, I thought as I made the appointment, I don't know what is. Advertisement  I opted to bring Charlie, who already frequently played the roles of “bad cop” and “no fun dad” in my life. He held my clenched hand while the doctor tried and failed to insert the IUD over and over again. She explained that she needed to stretch my vagina open with the speculum, clamp my cervix in place, and stick a metal rod deep inside me, past my cervix. But each time she got into position and dilated my cervical opening enough to fit the IUD, my body would clench up. So she repeated the process again and again. The pain was sharp and terrifying, and as the procedure wore on I panicked that I had put everyone through so many uncomfortable conversations for nothing. In comparison, Charlie’s scalpel-free, Xanax-fueled vasectomy sounded like a trip to Six Flags.After 10 minutes of this, the doctor told me we might want to stop. “You don’t understand,” I wanted to say. “He’s a musician. He has these tattoos and puppy dog eyes. I need birth control now, before I do something stupid.” This was when we realized my IUD insertion was not going to be easy or normal, but I wasn’t ready to give up. I asked my doctor to try one more time, and she finally shoved it in, just a centimeter short of where it apparently needed to land inside my battered uterus. After my doctor popped out the speculum, she scheduled me for an ultrasound and told me not to get my hopes up that the IUD would shift into place, while I clutched my cramping gut and sobbed.“Can you imagine if they made men go through this?” my doctor asked as we left her office. I couldn’t. But, not wanting to make Charlie bear the entire burden of my discomfort or gender inequality, I spent the rest of the day on Daniel’s couch, aching and scared. Advertisement  The next morning, an ultrasound revealed what I already knew — my extreme cramps were not normal, the IUD was malpositioned, my uterus and I were fucked until further notice. Daniel offered to drive me back to the doctor later that afternoon so it could come out — the longer it stayed in, the more I risked puncturing my uterus. And he held my hand while the doctor fished for the strings inside of me and noted that I was so clenched up, she couldn't even find my cervix at first.“Would you ever consider getting a vasectomy?” she asked Daniel, casually. We both stared blankly at her like deer in front of a semi, too tired to explain that no, this man wasn't the one I was barebacking with, either. Daniel was annoyed, but I tried to reason with him after we left the office: Sure, there was an undeniable intimacy to my decision to have unprotected sex with the manic pixie dog musician. But what about watching a doctor yank a metal rod out of my body, along with a blood clot so big that Daniel said, ""I think it winked at me”? That’s some intimacy right there.So what was my lucky guy doing during this whole ordeal? Walking dogs. Recording music. Eating chips and salsa with his roommates. I honestly had no clue. It would have been nice if he had been a little more attentive during my IUD insertion from hell, but I never wanted him to come to my rescue or feel responsible for my decision or for taking care of me. I didn’t get an IUD for him. We had feelings for each other, but we were mostly having fun. Advertisement  With Daniel and Charlie, we had fun and we had pain and we had love. The kind of love that once put me by Charlie’s side when he needed an emergency surgery a few years back, changing his bandages during his monthlong recovery, helping him pee in a cup. The kind of love that had me offering to help pay for Daniel’s car repairs without a second thought. They were the people I wanted by my side when I was struggling. That may not exactly sound like the most romantic thing I could say, but isn’t it? They were my team, my support system, my home — just like I had been for them so many times before. And this time, they were helping me explore the mystery in something strange, painful, and unknown.Now, almost a year has passed since I fell for Sam and asked my other partners and loves to adjust. The relationship with Sam didn’t make it through spring — those bad-boy vibes, while fun at first, turned out to be the early warning signs of some serious lifestyle incompatibilities. Thankfully, Charlie and Daniel are still around, streaming HBO shows with me and talking about birth control — although the terms of our relationships continue to evolve and change. Daniel and I are currently still involved, and Charlie and I have transitioned to being platonic roommates. Most importantly — yes, more important than the sex, even — we’re all learning not to resent the changes that come, but to go with them. ●

433,"“They’ve proven to you the alt-right is the alt-right. They’re racists, they’re antisemites...You knew that when you walked in here,” said a defense attorney in closing arguments.","


From a podium facing the jury, plaintiffs’ attorney Karen Dunn began her closing arguments in the landmark civil trial against neo-Nazis and other white supremacists by referencing defendant Richard Spencer.“Spencer said you should find for the plaintiffs because we are ‘on the side of the angels.’ That is not true,” Dunn said. “We are asking for you to find for us because if you consider the law and the evidence ... you will find for the plaintiffs.” Advertisement     Then, for an hour and a half, she methodically broke down for the jury the nature of what she alleged was a conspiracy to commit racially motivated violence, including how it was planned and executed on Aug. 11 and 12, 2017, ultimately leading to the murder of antiracist activist Heather Heyer and a weekend in Charlottesville that would shake the nation.The defendants maintain that there was no conspiracy and attempted to argue that the violence was provoked by antiracist counterprotesters.After more than three weeks of witness testimonies, jurors heard closing arguments Thursday in the trial against the white supremacist organizers of the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville four years ago.The federal lawsuit, filed by civil rights nonprofit Integrity First for America on behalf of nine people who were mentally or physically injured during the rally, alleges that 24 white nationalist figures and organizations conspired ahead of the event to commit racially motivated violence. Advertisement     
 


The plaintiffs spent more than two weeks building their case through what was often devastating testimony from victims of the violence at the Friday night torch march and the deadly car attack the following day that killed Heyer. Mountains of digital evidence include communications between the defendants in which they coordinated their movements during the rally and discussed bringing weapons to the event. In many instances, the conversations between the white supremacists included language about using violence to advance their racist agenda and even fomenting a “race war.”Underscoring the defendants’ own words, Dunn argued Thursday that the group of white nationalists had invited violent actors to Charlottesville and “built an army” of far-right extremists “to cause racially motivated violence at the 'Battle of Charlottesville.’”Dunn also spelled out for the jury what, according to the law, it means to be part of a conspiracy. For instance, she said, the defendants can be part of the conspiracy without knowing all coconspirators and all details of the plan.“A single act can be enough to draw a member into the conspiracy,” she said. “You don’t have to cause the violence yourself; the violence just has to be reasonably foreseeable to you.”Roberta Kaplan, her colead attorney, then spoke about the racist hatred that motivated the defendants, by using their own testimonies, social media posts, and manifestos against them.She asked for $7 million to $10 million in damages for the plaintiffs’ physical injuries and $3 million to $5 million for their pain and suffering.“You can also award punitive damages,” Kaplan said, adding that the amount would be purely up to the jury. “What would it take to ensure that defendants and their co-conspirators never ever do anything like this again?”Some of the defendants had used racist slurs and even name-checked Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf in their bizarre opening statements, but their closing arguments were more restrained.
 


James Kolenich, attorney for defendants Jason Kessler, Nathan Damigo, and the organization Identity Evropa, told the jury that the injuries the plaintiffs suffered and evidence of racism on social media doesn’t prove a conspiracy.“They’ve proven to you the alt-right is the alt-right. They’re racists, they’re antisemites,” Kolenich said. “You knew that when you walked in here. But what does that do to prove a conspiracy?”Kolenich argued that the defendants “didn’t agree to attack anybody offensively, and there is no evidence that they did.” Rather, he said, the defendants conspired only to provoke “antifa” into violence so that there would be “an actual legal reason” to fight in Charlottesville.David Campbell, attorney for defendant James Fields, who was previously convicted of murdering Heyer, used his time predominantly to argue about the cost of potential damages. Fields, who is in prison for life, doesn’t need to be financially punished to deter him from committing any more violent acts, he said.Spencer, arguing on his own behalf, told the jury in his closing arguments he was “grateful” to be able to defend extreme rhetoric.“White nationalism is about family. It's about us. It's about being a part of something bigger than yourself,” Spencer said. “It’s something I’m willing to risk quite a bit for.”The defendants took only two days to present their case, which boiled down to trying to show that not all of them knew one another and that those who did had had limited contact. They claimed the racist and violent communication that they posted on social media and sent each other in the weeks and days leading up to “Unite the Right” was merely rhetoric and speech protected by the First Amendment. And in a desperate attempt to get the case dismissed altogether, two of them filed a motion with the judge to throw it out. In response, the judge told them he believed there was sufficient evidence presented to prove the conspiracy allegation.The defendants’ direct examinations of witnesses were at times disjointed and rambling. Two of them, alt-right leader Spencer and neo-Nazi podcaster Christopher Cantwell, are defending themselves in court; the former because he couldn’t afford attorneys, and the latter because his outbursts scared off his legal counsel. Their questioning of one another, as well as that of the lead defendant and white nationalist Kessler, became an opportunity to air their grievances about each other, and their desires to lead the rally, in front of the jury. Advertisement     In one instance, Cantwell failed to show that Natalie Romero, who was badly injured during the riot, was a member of or sympathetic toward antifa — a decentralized collective of antiracists who protest against the far right. In doing so, he introduced evidence that showed him attacking a peaceful group of counterprotesters that included Romero and raised the question of whether he had hit her.Unlike a criminal trial, in which the jury must find guilt “beyond a reasonable doubt,” in this case, Judge Norman Moon said Wednesday, jurors need only to find that there is a “preponderance of evidence,” or a 50.1% possibility of the claim being true.The jury will begin deliberations Friday.

435,The most potent instrument Swift plays on Red (Taylor’s Version) is our knowledge of her past.,"


There is near consensus that the most devastating couplet Taylor Swift has ever penned comes from “All Too Well,” the crowning jewel of her fourth album, 2012’s Red. At the crescendo of the song, Swift delivers the line, “You call me up again just to break me like a promise / So casually cruel in the name of being honest.” It’s vintage Swift: unconvoluted imagery paired with a vividly emotional landscape. It’s also perfectly suited to the song, which captures a young woman’s devastation in the aftermath of a doomed, unequal relationship. The line shows up in Instagram captions and heart tattoos. It’s a really good line.But earlier this year, when Swift rereleased her second album, 2008’s Fearless, she tipped her hand with one of the bonus songs “from the vault,” i.e., songs she recorded during this period but never released. “Hello, Mr. ‘Casually cruel,’” she sings with feigned cheer on “Mr. ‘Perfectly fine.’” Apparently, the concept of casual cruelty had been ricocheting around Swift’s mind for years before it morphed into that perfect lyric. Advertisement     I bring this up because being a Swift fan is a lot like that meme of Charlie Day gesturing insistently at a board riddled with thumbtacks connected by string. This is how I often feel, wild-eyed and high-pitched, trying to explain the intertextual references Swift is making all the time, in every moment. We are a few days into the promotional cycle of her latest drop, and you can see why it has been a difficult time for Swift haters, and possibly even a trying time for those who are ambivalent about her.Swift is everywhere, and her fans are out door-knocking, trying to explain why you should let her into your heart. “See, the significance of the scarf is...,” they start. Honestly, I’m not sure why I’m saying “they.” I did this all day today. I will do it again tomorrow. I’m just trying to help you get it.In the last 15 months, Swift has set a new bar for pop star ubiquity: She released two No. 1 albums, 2020’s pair Folklore and Evermore, the former winning Album of the Year at the Grammys earlier this year. In the spring, she released a rerecording of her breakout album, 2008’s Fearless, and it promptly went to No. 1. And just this past weekend, she released another rerecording, this time of Red, and in the process she smashed multiple records, including most streamed album in a day by a woman and most streamed woman in one day in Spotify history.It’s been widely reported that Swift is rerecording her early work in order to gain financial and legal control of her own material. But the decision is also proving to be a brilliant business move. Red (Taylor’s Version) is projected to more than double the first-week sales of Fearless (Taylor’s Version) — in fact, it’s on track to have the second-best first-week sales of 2021 so far, after Drake’s Certified Lover Boy (a stat that’s unlikely to hold after Adele releases 30 on Friday). To say nothing of the overwhelming response to the pair of music videos she released over the weekend, and her performance of a 10-minute song on Saturday Night Live. Grab a scarf. It’s cardigan season. See, the significance of the cardigan is— Advertisement     Though Swift’s media savvy makes it look impossibly easy — inevitable, even — for Red (Taylor’s Version) to have become a juggernaut, the success of the rerelease has hinged on a different superpower: her extraordinary talent for transforming herself and her life into the main text fans are engaging with. On the rerecord, there’s plenty to be said about how her voice has changed or how her perspective has deepened. But the most potent instrument Swift plays on Red (Taylor’s Version) is our knowledge of her past and our familiarity with her as a public story.
 


Coming after three albums firmly rooted in country music, and following the entirely self-written feat that was 2010’s Speak Now, Red was the first time Swift intentionally opted for precarious ground genre-wise, signaling her intentions to move toward pop while still trying hard to maintain the fans she had developed as a country artist.You can hear this tension in the record. Explosive pop monuments like “I Knew You Were Trouble” and “We Are Never Getting Back Together” sit next to country-oriented songs like “I Almost Do” and “Begin Again.” The range was reflected in the producers and writers she worked with, like Nathan Chapman, who handled her first three albums, but also pop heavyweights like Max Martin and Shellback. Advertisement     
 


Though some critics found the genre-blending incoherent, Red was ultimately a success. It sold more than a million copies in the first week and spent seven weeks at the top of the charts. Swift became the first artist since the Beatles to have three consecutive albums each spend more than six weeks at No. 1. Red was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Country Album at the Grammys, losing the former to Daft Punk and the latter to Kacey Musgraves. In liner notes and interviews, she made it clear that she was trying to take an exit ramp from her previous country sound so she could transition to pop.Even within the context of an artist as inclined toward the diaristic as Swift is, narrative is central to Red — both in the straightforward sense of placing key elements of her story in the album, but also in the meta sense that the record had a job to do: Red needed to transform her superstardom narrative.Swift became famous inside a country music paradigm; as the New York Times noted in the wake of Red, it’s a genre that “demands morals in a way pop doesn’t.” In order to keep the fans she had earned, Swift had to carefully lead listeners away from country morality without shocking them. She leaned on her innocence as the device to tell this story, both its preservation (see: “Begin Again”) and its loss (see: “All Too Well”). On Red, Swift telegraphs that she is moving beyond the boundaries of what country music can accommodate.All of this makes Red (Taylor’s Version) a particularly compelling document because you already know she stuck the landing. After her jump to full-fledged pop superstardom, listening to Red (Taylor’s Version) is a fun exercise in pretending to forget you know the ending — gosh, I hope this kid can make it.But knowing the ending is both a benefit and a liability for Red (Taylor’s Version). A benefit: The songs that were already great got better. The drums on “State of Grace” sound deeper, the guitars crisper and more shimmery, because she’s learned how that song bounces off the walls of stadiums; “Holy Ground” has also fully grown as a mega anthem. The rerecord also delivers justice to some of her relatively overlooked work. The gorgeous “Treacherous” is carried to new heights by Swift’s more mature delivery. She is capable of rendering a deeper pain in her voice on the 2021 version of “Sad Beautiful Tragic.” And it’s a delight to hear her full of tenderness for her younger self on “Stay Stay Stay.” As the song ends, Swift lets out a little laugh. “That’s so fun,” she says, a re-creation of how the original ends. But in Taylor’s Version, she sounds wistful, as though she’s strolling down memory lane.A liability, though: The weaker songs can’t keep up with the gems. No amount of time and growth as an artist can rescue “Girl at Home” from mediocrity. Disappointingly, the big pop numbers lose their urgency. “I Knew You Were Trouble” and “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” certainly come across as sure-footed. Perhaps this is because, spoiler, these songs were big hits. But the OG versions of both had a desperation about them, a bombastic delivery born of Swift’s need for this pop gamble to work.But the album’s profound gift is in the vault tracks, which were all written for Red at the time but didn’t make the final cut. From an original 22 songs, Red (Taylor’s Version) has now swelled to 30. The additions include her first studio recording of “Better Man,” a song Swift wrote but that Little Big Town released (they also won Song of the Year at the Country Music Association Awards with it), but also tracks we’re hearing for the first time, like the country taunt “I Bet You Think About Me” featuring Chris Stapleton.The best of the new offerings is “Nothing New,” which also ends a long-running frustration for fans who have been keeping track of the fact that while Swift has collaborated with plenty of women (Haim, the Chicks), none has ever sung a verse on one of her songs. Here, this ache is soothed as Swift heir Phoebe Bridgers steps up to share the mic.“Nothing New” is an anxious song. “Lord, what will become of me / Once I’ve lost my novelty,” she wonders. But it’s the bridge that offers the most fascinating insight into what she was thinking at the time. She imagines what it would be like to meet the next It girl, the next big thing, and plays out the encounter: “She’ll know the way and she’ll say she got the map from me / I’ll say I’m happy for her, then I’ll cry myself to sleep.” Though penned for Red, these words take on a new meaning when you consider that when Olivia Rodrigo made her mark this year, she not only credited Swift as her North Star but literally had to give her writing credits on her debut album. Nine years ago, Swift was worried about whoever would take her place. Present-day Swift quotes her own mother in endorsing Rodrigo: “I say that’s my baby and I’m really proud.”The most talked-about song from the vault is the new version of “All Too Well.” For almost a decade, the fandom has carefully uplifted the song, carrying it to mythic heights. It has become the Swift song. Rumors had existed of more verses, a longer version, perhaps even a 20-minute version. Red (Taylor’s Version) finally delivered the promised artifact, “All Too Well (10 Minute Version).” And it is spectacular.Back to that perfect line — in the OG, the “casually cruel” couplet anchors the song’s bridge and delivers an emotional wallop. It’s part of what makes “All Too Well” so beloved. Swift locates the universal within her specific pain. It arrives as we near the end, hurtling toward resolution. But in the 10-minute iteration, it arrives somewhere in the middle. Where do we go from here? What’s there left to say?
 


The longer “All Too Well” then suspends the graceful universality she achieved in the original and trades it for deadly specificity. The unnamed lover, long rumored to be Jake Gyllenhaal, is brought to life in colorful detail: the way he belittles Swift’s age (“You said if we had been closer in age / Maybe it would’ve been fine”), his emotional coldness (“The idea you had of me / Who was she?”), his betrayal on a birthday that ends with her dad comforting her (“He watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come / And he said, ‘It’s supposed to be fun turning 21’”). The song is seething, teeming with rage. She added to the hype when she released “Sad Girl Autumn version” earlier this week — a quieter, piano-forward version recorded with her Folklore collaborators Aaron Dessner and Jon Low. “One of the saddest songs I’ve ever written just got sadder,” she announced.Second-year students in Swift studies will recognize the birthday party incident from “The Moment I Knew.” But the existence of the 10-minute “All Too Well” fundamentally alters the reading of Red, casting it as an album mostly about a specific relationship rather than the eclectic mix it was initially perceived as. And even though she left the excoriating “Better Man” off the 2012 album, presumably because it would’ve committed her more deeply to country music, it’s clearly about the same relationship — another piece originally left out of the puzzle.Musical appraisal of Swift often gives way to light biography. To assess her music is to read and reread the text of her life. Swift is, of course, aware of this dynamic and uses it to her advantage. She has filled her social media feeds and liner notes with Easter eggs and constant invitations to decode the lyrics, music, and visuals in order to interpret the context that birthed them. This method has been on overdrive during the release of Red (Taylor’s Version), especially in the short film Swift released for the 10-minute “All Too Well,” starring a Gyllenhaalesque Dylan O’Brien and Swiftian Sadie Sink. Written and directed by Swift herself, it portrays the collapse of a brief relationship and has already invited lengthy breakdowns of all the secret codes it could contain. Did you know the car in the short film was manufactured in 1989? Do you think it means 1989 (Taylor’s Version) is next?There’s been plenty of discourse about whether Gyllenhaal and Swift’s short-lived relationship warrants all of this. Leaving aside that I am not in the business of assigning proportionality to how a relationship ought to be mourned, that enticing and gossipy dimension of the story is the engine that helped push Red (Taylor’s Version) to its massive success.
 


The 10-minute “All Too Well” also contains a line we hadn’t heard before: “You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath.” That is a bar. If a lesser writer wrote those words, you would probably never hear the end of it. If I wrote that, I would tell everyone I knew. Swift wrote that and left it on the cutting-room floor.Songwriter Liz Rose, who collaborated with Swift on “All Too Well” and some of the brightest spots of her early work, said in a 2014 interview that she acted more like an editor. The OG “All Too Well” is better for the editing: focused, sturdy, sublime.I was anxious that the 10-minute “All Too Well” would be bloated. Self-editing is generally a good idea. It always pays off. The risk of Red (Taylor’s Version) was playing with the legacy of an album and a song that became larger than life. Here are some drafts is a move few writers can get away with. But now we are hearing these drafts, it’s still on Swift’s terms, in accordance with the careful ways she has turned her life into text. The fictional version of Swift in the short film is an author. At the end, we see her at her own book launch, and no other framing could be so apt or telling. With the rerelease of this pivotal record, Swift has once again made a complicated story her own. ●

436,“The idea of making a chronicle of such violence to the earth set the course for much of my future work.”,"


David Maisel started out studying architecture, but a chance encounter with a photobook vendor on the streets of New York changed the course of his career forever. His topographical images of landscapes going through violent environmental changes look abstract from a distance, and then once you get a little bit closer, the toll on the landscape is impossible to unsee. When he began taking aerial photographs from helicopters of open pit mining sites and extensive logging in the American West in the 1980s, many people, from the art world to the Environmental Protection Agency, were struggling with taking the rising threats to the environment seriously.Now, Maisel's work feels more prescient and urgent than ever. On the heels of COP26, the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow that has been criticized for failing to produce tangible, effective promises to limit greenhouse gases, these photos are undeniable proof of how much irretrievable damage we have already done to the planet. Maisel's show at the Edwynn Houk Gallery runs through November 20. We spoke with him over email about his travels, COP26, and Mars. Advertisement  
 


When did you first realize that you wanted to photograph the environment and landscape?Because of my work in architecture, I was already concerned with how the human-made world fit into and pushed against the natural world. In the summer of 1983, I accompanied Emmet Gowin on a photographic expedition to the volcano Mount St. Helens. Witnessing the aftermath of the so-called natural disaster of the volcano was fascinating, but what I found most compelling was seeing the scale with which the logging industry was clear-cutting the area. The violence of that activity was deeply disturbing, and the idea of making a chronicle of such violence to the earth set the course for much of my future work.Simultaneously: The preeminent photo historian Peter Bunnell was teaching at Princeton, and through his classes I was able to explore original prints of photographers I found relevant and inspiring, from that of the New Topographics image makers, to that of the exploratory photographers of the 19th century, who showed processes of industrialization in the American West (and notions of Manifest Destiny taking form in the land) and sites of imperialism globally. That work spoke to me both formally and in terms of the politics inherent in these images of human-wrought change to the natural world. Advertisement  In the decades you've been working on this series, how many countries/states in the US have you traveled to?I’ve concentrated my work on many of the western states, and throughout the Rocky Mountain region — Montana, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, California, Arizona, and Alaska. I’ve also made work on clear-cutting in northern Maine. I’ve made extensive projects in Spain, Iceland, and most recently, Chile’s Atacama Desert, where vast lithium and copper mines are impacting this highly sensitive eco-region. What I have felt has been surprise, yes, but also: horror, confusion, despair, revulsion.
 


How has your awareness of the environment changed over the years?In the mid-1980s, when I first began making aerial photographs of open pit mining sites in the American West, there was not much discourse on issues of the environment, especially within the art world. It was almost seen as a throwback — hey, didn’t we cover all this during the 60s with the Ecology Movement? What’s left to discuss? Advertisement  Over time, we’ve collectively come to understand that we are in a precarious place with regards to the environment, and that our own collective actions are responsible for climate change, natural resource depletion, and all the effects that ripple outward from those actions. In terms of my own awareness: when I began making this work in the 1980s, I focused entirely on making pictures within the United States. It was natural for me to start by working in my country of birth, but I also felt hesitant to critique countries where I wasn’t from and hadn’t lived. As time has passed, I feel that it makes sense to consider the global impact of human-wrought change; the challenges we are facing are indeed global. And my work is never intended solely as a criticism of a particular nation; these environmental issues transcend national boundaries.
 


What do you want people to take away from these photographs?We are all complicit in making these damaged sites. I hope the pictures encourage viewers to become more active in placing a higher priority on issues of the environment. Especially living in San Francisco, the effects of climate change over the last few years seems so intense.What are your hopes for the future?Climate change is definitely not an abstract thing “out there.” It is happening at my doorstep. The firestorms in California and throughout the West in the past few years have occurred at an unprecedented scale within recent human history. My hopes for the future are that governments and citizens alike, activists and consumers alike, can embrace the idea of tackling climate change head-on. What does this mean on a personal level? How can we pull back from our usual patterns of consumption? We need to be smarter, we need architects and designers and scientists and artists and philosophers and legislators to build a path forward, and we need new patterns of behavior.That being said, I write this as COP26, the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, is drawing to a close without meeting the necessary goals for substantive change; it’s hard to be hopeful in light of this, but where will we be without hope? Advertisement  What more do you want to do with your work in the future?Mars seems ripe for exploration! On a more earthly realm…since the start of the pandemic, I have been making paintings again, and I’m deeply satisfied by this process. It’s somewhat like working in the darkroom — a series of alchemical explorations, both mysterious and controlled.The paintings are, not surprisingly, abstracted images of landscapes having to do with both memory and environmental degradation — the fires and drought we are experiencing here in the West, especially. In terms of photography…I hope to be able to continue to bear witness and make records of environmental transformation and degradation. I’d like to follow the development of lithium mines around the globe, and to picture the impact that these mines have on their environments. We have embraced lithium as an alternative to fossil fuels and as a way to power our electric cars, our iPhones, etc., but its extraction comes at a terrible cost.

437,"“The equal sentiment [we both share] is just that when you really love and care about somebody, some moments or things, you wish were your own.”","By now, I’m sure you’re well aware that Tom Holland and Zendaya are basically the internet’s favorite couple. From their Instagram interactions to their red carpet appearances, pretty much everything they do sends fans into an absolute frenzy of love and adoration — and can we be blamed? Long before they appeared to confirm their romantic relationship back in September, all eyes were already on the costars as they shared the screen portraying one of Marvel’s most beloved fictional duos. And now, opening up about their relationship for the first time ever in a shared interview, Tom and Zendaya got brutally honest about the “downsides” of being one of young Hollywood’s most-talked-about power couples. But first, in case you need a reminder of how Tom and Zendaya came to be — allow me to give a brief rundown of how they went from costars to couple. Whispers of a romantic relationship between the two began when filming for Spider-Man: Homecoming first started back in 2016, with Zendaya and Tom debuting their respective roles as MJ and Spider-Man/Peter Parker. And if you’ve been a longtime fan of the Spider-Man cinematic universe, it’ll come as no surprise that the pair were very quickly bundled up in romance rumors. Seemingly following in the footsteps of previous MJ/Spider-Man iterations who actually went on to pursue offscreen relationships — yes, we’re talking about you, Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. So, after months of constantly appearing on each other's social media accounts, hitting red carpets together, and even sharing magazine covers, People magazine finally gave fans what they wanted to hear, and at long last, it was reported in 2017 that Tom and Zendaya were officially dating — yay! But sadly things weren’t quite that simple, and Tom and Zendaya basically laughed the whole thing off and insisted that they’re simply just ""best friends"" and nothing more...for now. So a year goes by, and just as we’d finally come to accept that maybe the celeb romance of our dreams just wasn’t meant to be, Tom threw fans a real curveball in 2018 by hopping onto Instagram to share a tribute post for Zendaya’s Met Gala look. “All hail the queen,” he wrote, before proceeding to sprinkle a bit of we’re-just-friends coolness by adding, “killing it mate” — “mate” being the key word here. Years passed and our hopes began to fade — that was until Page Six gave fans their biggest piece of evidence yet. Which brings us to ~those~ viral kissing photos. So, in case you were absent from social media at all in early July, the internet basically exploded this summer when photographs of Tom and Zendaya kissing in a parked car surfaced online. Given their PDA, many took these snaps to be pretty solid confirmation that, at long last, Tom and Zendaya were finally an item. However, at this point in their rumored romance, neither Tom nor Zendaya had had the chance to confirm the relationship on their own terms, which as Tom explained to GQ this week, was pretty upsetting for them both. “One of the downsides of our fame is that privacy isn’t really in our control anymore,” Tom said, seemingly addressing the leaked images for the very first time. “And a moment that you think is between two people that love each other very much is now a moment that is shared with the entire world.” It wasn’t until two months after the viral kissing photos were leaked that Tom and Zendaya were able to reclaim their control on the situation and seemingly confirm the relationship themselves. Much to fans’ delight, Tom marked Zendaya’s birthday on Sept. 1 by sharing a sweet selfie of the duo cozied up on the Spider-Man set, which he captioned: “My MJ, have the happiest of birthdays. Gimme a call when your up.” Opening up about the whole thing now, Tom said that he and Zendaya felt they had been “robbed” of their privacy after the images surfaced online, before explaining that they had not been intending to go public with their relationship at that stage in the romance. “I’ve always been really adamant to keep my private life private, because I share so much of my life with the world anyway,” he said. “We sort of felt robbed of our privacy.” In response, the interviewer hinted that maybe Tom and Zendaya had not been ready to share their relationship with fans — perhaps in light of the years of intense speculation about their closeness — to which the actor responded: “I don’t think it’s about not being ready. It’s just that we didn’t want to.” And it’s no secret that, with the next installment of the Spider-Man franchise just around the corner, Tom and Zendaya’s relationship is about to find itself under the gaze of millions as they embark on a highly publicized global press tour — something which Tom seemed to consider with his next statement. “It’s not a conversation that I can have without her,” he said of their relationship. “You know, I respect her too much to say…this isn’t my story. It’s our story. And we’ll talk about what it is when we’re ready to talk about it together.” Speaking of whom, the lady herself later joined in on the conversation by phone to give her perspective on the public fascination that surrounds their relationship. Also speaking out about the romance for the first time, Zendaya said she found the whole thing — perhaps, more specifically the leaked kissing photographs — “confusing and invasive.” “It was quite strange and weird and confusing and invasive,” the Dune actor said, before going on to address their lack of privacy in a little more detail. “The equal sentiment [we both share] is just that when you really love and care about somebody, some moments or things, you wish were your own...” Zendaya added. She continued: “I think loving someone is a sacred thing and a special thing and something that you want to deal with and go through and experience and enjoy amongst the two people that love each other.” Interestingly, their joint interview comes just several months after the Euphoria star hinted that her dating life is something that she hopes to keep to herself. Gracing the cover of British Vogue’s September issue, the young star opened up about her refusal to have her first kiss onscreen in her days as a Disney Channel star. “I remember being on Shake It Up and being like, ‘I’m not gonna do this. I’m going to kiss him on the cheek because I haven’t been kissed yet so I don’t want the kiss to be on camera,” the former child-star explained. The sentiment behind her childhood story could perhaps be applied to the invasion of privacy she was later faced with when photographs of her and Tom kissing were leaked to the public — which, we now know, happened just the day after her Vogue interview took place in July. So, while their sweet Instagram interactions might have initially given the impression that Tom and Zendaya were ready to take their romance to the main stage, their recent comments seem to indicate that they’re taking things slow for now. However, in the meantime, we can look forward to hopefully seeing this beloved duo grace the red carpet together sometime in the near future to celebrate the release of Spider-Man: No Way Home next month."
438,"A lawsuit by Mamie Mitchell, a script supervisor on Rust, says “there was nothing in the script” requiring the use of a firearm in the upcoming scene.","


A new lawsuit filed by a Rust crew member on Wednesday alleges that Alec Baldwin discharged the gun that accidentally killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins last month despite the fact that the script for the scene to be filmed that day did not call for a gun to be fired.Mamie Mitchell, a script supervisor on Rust who was standing four feet away from Baldwin when he fired the loaded gun on Oct. 21, is suing Baldwin and the movie's producers, alleging that their actions were ""reckless"" and caused her ""severe emotional distress."" Mitchell was the person who called 911 after Hutchins and director Joel Souza were shot. Advertisement     ""Alec Baldwin intentionally, without just cause or excuse, cocked and fired the loaded gun even though the upcoming scene to be filmed did not call for the cocking and firing of a firearm,"" the lawsuit states. ""Mr. Baldwin chose to play Russian Roulette with a loaded gun without checking it and without having the Armorer do so.""Authorities have said that Baldwin discharged the prop gun while rehearsing for a scene in the Western indie movie inside a church in New Mexico. At the time, the Santa Fe sheriff's office said that a “scene being filmed involved a prop firearm when it was discharged.""But Mitchell alleges in her lawsuit that no rehearsal had been called and the crew had not begun filming at the time Baldwin fired the prop gun.
 


According to the lawsuit, Mitchell, Hutchins, and Souza discussed three upcoming camera shots to be used in the next scene when filming resumed after the lunch break on Oct. 21. One shot focused on Baldwin's eyes, another on a bloodstain on his shoulder, and a third on his torso ""as he reached down to his holster and removed the gun,"" the lawsuit said.""There was nothing in the script about the gun being discharged"" by Baldwin or anyone else, the lawsuit states.Had the scene called for a gun to be discharged, Mitchell — according to the lawsuit — would have been required to stand outside the church to view Baldwin's actions on exterior monitors.The lawsuit also names Rust's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, as a defendant, alleging that there were multiple violations of industrywide safety protocols for the use of firearms on movie sets.Reed previously told investigators that she had checked to make sure that no ""hot"" or live ammunition rounds were in the gun that was eventually handed to Baldwin by assistant director Dave Halls, who picked it up from a rolling cart and yelled out that it was a ""cold gun,"" indicating that it was safe to use.The lawsuit accuses Baldwin, an industry veteran, of relying on Hall's assurance that the gun was not loaded instead of checking it himself.Representatives for Reed, Baldwin, and the producers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""The fact that live ammunition was allowed on a movie set, that guns and ammunition were left unattended on a cart and allowed to be handled by those who had no business handling them, the fact that safety bulletins were not promulgated or ignored makes this a case where injury or death was much more than just a possibility; it was a likely result,"" Gloria Allred, Mitchell's attorney, said in a statement at a press conference Wednesday.As BuzzFeed News previously reported, two of the filmmakers involved in the making of Rust own a company known for working in unsafe conditions.On the day of the shooting, several Rust camera operators and their assistants had walked off the job to protest payment and housing issues, according to the lawsuit and court documents.
 


During Wednesday's press conference, a tearful Mitchell recalled the sequence of events that led to the death of Hutchins, whom she described as a ""great collaborator"" and ""my new friend.""Mitchell said that after lunch, she went inside the church with other crew members to get ready for camera setup.

When Mitchell returned home, she was told that Hutchins had died of the gunshot wound to her chest.""I stood in my driveway screaming,"" Mitchell said, adding that the shooting had left her depressed and feeling unsafe.Mitchell has been working as a script supervisor for 40 years, she said.""I have never before seen anything like what happened on Oct. 21, and I never want to see what happened on that date happen again,"" she said.

439,"Paul Gosar’s “creative” team, who made the violent meme, just earned him an official condemnation from the House of Representatives.","


WASHINGTON — House Democrats voted to censure Rep. Paul Gosar and remove him from two committees after he posted an anime video of him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joe Biden.The resolution passed Wednesday with the support of all Democrats and just two Republicans. David Joyce, a Republican from Ohio, voted present. The censure — a rarely used rebuke — publicly condemns Gosar and strips him of his seats on the Natural Resources and Oversight and Reform committees. Advertisement     Gosar defended himself on the House floor ahead of the vote but spent much of the time talking about illegal immigration.""It was not my purpose to make anyone upset,” he said, insisting that the cartoon was just a statement about differences over immigration policy. “There is no threat in the cartoon other than the threat immigration poses to our country.""Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pushed back directly against Speaker Nancy Pelosi and pointed to comments made by Democratic members during Black Lives Matter protests and about the Kyle Rittenhouse trial.The resolution to censure Gosar highlights both the increasing threats of violence that members of Congress have faced and the tension between Democrats and Republicans since the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.""This is not about me,” Ocasio-Cortez said on the House floor. “This is not about Rep. Gosar, but this is about what we are willing to accept. Not just the Republican leader, but I have seen other members of this party advance the argument, including Rep. Gosar himself, the illusion that this was just a joke. That what we say and what we do does not matter so long as we claim a lack of meaning."" Advertisement     The vote to censure Gosar comes after he posted on social media an altered clip from Attack on Titan, a popular anime show. The minute and a half video showed an animated character with Gosar’s face attacking what looked like Ocasio-Cortez. Seconds later, Gosar’s character flies through the air and attacks a Biden-like character with two swords. His accompanying text on Twitter read: “The creativity of my team is off the hook.”At the start of the vote, Gosar remained in the back of the room talking to Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Darrell Issa. Reps. Andy Biggs, Lauren Boebert, and Bob Good joined them for brief periods before Gosar slipped into the cloakroom.Rep. Jackie Speier, with other members, led the effort in introducing the resolution last week. Rep. Ted Deutch introduced the amendment to take away Gosar’s committee assignments. The resolution also criticized House leadership for not publicly condemning him.“The depictions of violence can foment actual violence and jeopardize the safety of elected officials, as witnessed in this chamber on January 6, 2021,” the text of the resolution reads. It goes on to note that violence against women in politics is “meant to silence women and discourage them from seeking positions of authority and participating in public life” and that women of color are disproportionately impacted by the issue.Rep. Ted Lieu, one of the first members to condemn the video on social media, told BuzzFeed News that the House would expel Gosar if Republicans joined them.“In any other workplace in America, if a coworker made a snuff film about murdering another coworker, that person would be fired,” Lieu said. “The least we can do is remove him from all these committees, which we intend to do today.”Republican Reps. Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney, two GOP members who currently serve on the House committee investigating the attack on the Capitol, publicly stated they’d support the censure a day ahead of the vote. They voted in favor. Advertisement     “We have to hold Members accountable who incite or glorify violence, who spread and perpetuate dangerous conspiracies,” Kinzinger wrote in a Twitter post. “The failure to do so will take us one step closer to this fantasized violence becoming real.”After widespread criticism from Democrats, Gosar doubled down with a second meme. In it, one crying character says, “Your cartoon anime scares me,” and another character responds, “It’s a cartoon. Relax.” The same day, Gosar released a formal statement defending the video; he said he didn’t mean to “espouse violence” and suggested the fighting symbolizes policy disputes in Congress.“This video is truly a symbolic portrayal of a fight over immigration policy,” he said in the statement. He went on to attack Ocasio-Cortez’s stance on the issue.Twitter flagged the post as hateful content, and Gosar later deleted the video.He is the second Republican to be stripped of committee assignments this year after the House voted to remove Greene from her assignments after her past social media posts, including a photoshopped picture of her holding a gun next to Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive members, resurfaced shortly after she was sworn into Congress.Gosar, a six-term member of Congress, had recently come under fire from Democrats after his name appeared on a fundraising flyer with Nick Fuentes, a known white nationalist. Gosar denied any participation in the event but had teamed up with Fuentes months earlier at an America First Political Action Conference.During his 2018 reelection bid, six of his nine siblings released an ad supporting his Democratic opponent. After the anime video was posted, one sister told Alisyn Camerota during a CNN interview, “Does he have to act on it himself before we believe that he is an absolute, he's a sociopath?”Gosar is now part of a small club of representatives. Twenty-three members have been censured with the earliest dating back to 1832, according to the Congressional Research Service. The last censure of a House member was in 2010, when Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel of New York was censured for making improper financial disclosures, failing to pay taxes, and improper solicitation of funds.

Chloe Gong is the New York Times bestselling author of the YA historical fantasy novel These Violent Delights, the first book in her duology, which concludes with Our Violent Ends. First-time readers will not only be immersed in Gong's impressive worldbuilding (the series is set in 1920s Shanghai), but they'll also find all the things that make up a great fantasy novel: enemies-to-lovers, forbidden love, heart-pounding action sequences, race-against-the-clock stakes, surprising villains, and so much yearning and tension. Gong's books are long (the last one clocking nearly 500 pages), but they're intriguing — political and thoughtful — and keep readers hungry for more. I recently had the opportunity to chat with Chloe, where we discussed the strange parallels of the pandemic and this series, writing these books while attending university, and how she'll continue to expand this world in future novels.
 


Hi Chloe! This is Farrah with BuzzFeed! Thanks so much for taking the time to chat with me today. I’m so excited we could make this happen! How are you doing?Hi Farrah!! It’s an honor to be chatting with you. I’m very delighted hehe. I’m good! How are you?I’m great, thank you! I’m such a fan of both of these books, and I have so many questions I am dying to ask you. Let’s dive right in!Our Violent Ends is the finale of your duology that began with These Violent Delights, which is set in 1920s Shanghai and inspired by Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. What inspired you to create this story told within this world? And why the 1920s?
 


SO excited for the questions, and I will try very hard not to typo all over the place or slip into my usual lower-case-everywhere habits. I first got the idea for a Romeo and Juliet meets 1920s Shanghai story because I wanted to write about two families caught in a blood feud and the inherent tension that comes with trying to fight against that. I LOVE angst, and I had grown up reading angsty YA, and the stories that I was most obsessed with always involved love and hate and familial drama. But I also wanted to see myself represented in the type of angsty heroines who got to star in those fantastical stories, so the immediate setting that came to mind for mine was 1920s Shanghai, since I had grown up hearing about this golden age era from the cool stories my parents pass on from *their* parents and relatives. I’ve always adored the Roaring '20s aesthetic, but there was something especially delicious about Shanghai at this time — the good, the bad, and the ugly where the streets were soaked in debauchery, but it was efforts of foreign colonialism that caused the sense of party in the city…so it was just a perfect setting for me to really sink into and explore!I, too, love books filled with angst! It’s so interesting to hear that stories passed down from your family helped shape your own novels. You paint the setting so well. And speaking of angsty heroines, Juliette is this fierce, protective total badass. What sparked the idea to create her as your main character?I truly never would have been as drawn to Shanghai as I was and as I still am if it weren’t for my family’s stories! Juliette is so close to my heart. When I set out to create her I wanted to fully embrace the “overpowered” archetype: the girl who is going to stab anyone who upsets her… but still allow her to be flawed enough to be upset and messy and unreasonable. I had grown up reading about the Celaena Sardothiens and Isabelle Lightwoods and I thought, you know, it’s high time we get a Chinese diaspora character in YA fantasy who fits into this archetype too. A thing that was really important to me, too, was that Juliette embraces her femininity whilst being powerful. We kind of went through an era in YA where female main characters could either be feminine or they could be strong — ditching the dresses for the knives — but I wanted Juliette to be both, where she was fierce and liked wearing pretty things and maybe wearing those pretty things also gave her a certain power to navigate her society.I love everything about this. It’s very true that those certain archetypes existed within YA, and I love that Juliette is strong and powerful while still embracing her femininity. You can be both!
 


I don’t want to step into spoiler-y territory for Our Violent Ends, but I’m curious about this: Did you know how this book would end from the very beginning?Oooooh, very good question! I both did and I didn’t. And by that I mean These Violent Delights and Our Violent Ends used to be one big manuscript, but in that original format there was still so much of the story that I could flesh out, such as Roma and Juliette swapping into each other’s shoes (which is how we open Our Violent Ends: Juliette now being the one keeping secrets from Roma while Roma was the one keeping secrets in the first book) or such as the side characters like Benedikt and Marshall. So when my editor suggested a duology instead, I of course jumped at that idea and started the process of splitting them up. Our Violent Ends has the original climax from the original manuscript, so I’ve always known the course that the sequel would take and how each character would move around. But! The final chapters of Our Violent Ends are now drastically different from the original ending I set out with from the very beginning! I think once I had the chance to expand the world, more of the characters’ goals and desires revealed themselves to me, which also informed the ultimate ending and altered it. I do love this new ending much, much more.This is so fascinating! I am certainly grateful your editor had the brilliant idea of making this a duology in order for you to more thoroughly explore this world and these characters, because I really loved getting so many of these characters' perspectives. It’s so rich and layered!Editors are brilliant!That is a fact!OK, so you sold the book in early 2019, but it came out at the end of last year, so you had no idea how oddly topical some of the themes would be in 2020–21. What was your reaction to this? And what’s been the reaction of your readers?WOW, yes, the topical nature of These Violent Delights was a shock when 2020 happened! I was honestly a little worried. When COVID started there was, of course, intense Sinophobia going through the States and anti-Asian hate crimes, and outside of my own personal safety, I was also trying to debut a book that was, well… very Chinese. From January through March, I was still in final edits, and it was bizarre reading through my own fictional passages about how the foreigners in 1920s Shanghai believed the “madness” to be a locals-only thing, and they didn’t care about it until it hit them…all while the US wasn’t doing lockdown and calling it a “Chinese virus” until suddenly the numbers started spiking here. I don’t think I’m a modern-day Cassandra or anything; I guess human nature and Western imperialist ideas just haven’t really changed much, because even though the monster and the madness in These Violent Delights was invented, the attitudes of the foreigners in the book very much were not. Readers have picked up on it for sure, and I’m really glad to offer a book that incites discussion relevant to current events, whether it’s among friends or in classrooms, since this is aimed at young adults! I’ve gotten people sending me pictures of the page in These Violent Delights where it just says “GET VACCINATED!” asking if I wrote it after COVID, and every time I’ve had to be like, “Nope, wrote it wayyyyy before; getting vaccinated is just always a good call!""I can only imagine how bizarre that must have been, reading the manuscript back during a time when things had changed so drastically. But you’re right, it does allow young readers to have their own discussions about the world through fiction. And yes, getting vaccinated is, as you said, always a good idea.Once readers get to the end of this series, they’re going to want to know what’s next from you. (Myself included.) Is there anything you can tell us about your third book, which is also set within this same world? Specifically, are you able to say which character we will primarily follow in the next one? 👀
 


Hehehe, sadly I can’t reveal that yet, but once Our Violent Ends comes out there will be much more information so that we’re not spoiling the original duology! All I can say now is that my third book, Foul Lady Fortune, is a spinoff set a few years after the events of Our Violent Ends, and while we will be primarily following one character we’ve already met, there are also other familiar characters in the main cast, and I LOVE expanding on existing worlds, so it’s been such a fun experience to push these characters farther now that they get their time in the limelight. I’ve been pitching Foul Lady Fortune as a political C-drama meets a Marvel movie because it’s about fake-married undercover spies who are assigned a mission to fight Japanese imperialism in China, so there’s also a bit of a tone shift from These Violent Delights and Our Violent Ends as far as genre goes, but I think readers who are familiar with my usual angst mixed with dramatics will also be eager to tune in. ;)Haha, I had to try and ask! But I am SO ready for this. It sounds incredible!I’d love to talk about YOU for a second. I read that you began writing at 13, sharpened your skills by writing on Wattpad for many years, and finished writing These Violent Delights when you were 19 — and while still in college. AND These Violent Delights debuted on the NYT bestseller list! It’s all incredibly impressive. What was the most difficult part? Was it tough navigating both your college course load and your publishing deadlines?It was super tough! It got harder as I aged up, because back when I was 13, writing was a fun little hobby that I did when I had finished all my homework, and I didn’t think of it as anything except an enjoyment to kill time. It took a lot of pressure off of me while I was learning craft since there was never an end goal of publication or making something of the stories; I was just writing because I loved telling stories so much. Once I got an agent with These Violent Delights and started looking at it professionally, balancing the hustling with academia was a task! There were times where I needed to be strict with myself: I often couldn’t treat a Friday/the weekends like a regular college student because I would be on deadline, and I knew I needed to sit at my desk to make progress. Or if I had an assignment and a manuscript draft due on the same day, I would be planning my schedule months in advance instead of a few days before because otherwise I wouldn’t be able to stay on top of it. I wouldn’t have had it any other way, and I enjoyed my college experience as a dual student/author, but it really did test my calendar planning abilities, haha!That definitely sounds like a challenge, and it’s so encouraging to see that it paid off! What advice do you have for young writers who look up to you and your career trajectory?To keep writing! And I know that just sounds like the most “well, duh” advice ever, but I think it’s really worth its weight in gold — when it comes to being a writer, there are no tricks to learn, and there are no hidden secrets. There’s only working and working on your craft until it’s at a level that you can convey your stories and ideas and thoughts with, and then whether the next step is traditional publishing or non-traditional publishing, the world is truly your oyster. Adjacent to the advice of just keep going, for young writers especially, you also need to stay confident and believe in yourself, because at the end of the day most people break into the industry when they’re older, and there aren’t that many of us here, and we’re going to get talked over and told that we’re not ready by people who don’t know us. Every writer knows their own craft the most — if you’re ready to tackle writing stories and publishing them, then you’re ready, and you should do it.I love this! OK, it’s no secret that you’re a master at using social media to market yourself and your book. Coming from someone who’s been in the digital media space for some time, it seems that when users feel like they're being sold something, or they find something inauthentic, they instantly want to scroll on. A certain creative balance has to be met. Do you have a specific approach to social media? Were you surprised at the growth of your audience?Aw, shucks, I’m just on social media a lot, but I certainly won’t complain about being called a master at it, hahaha! I absolutely agree: People hate inauthentic content! My approach is generally to be as genuine as possible, which doesn’t necessarily mean that I’m putting all of myself onto the internet, but that I’m cultivating the parts of me that I’m happy for people to see and sharing what I’m comfortable with to make jokes and funny content that might also attract people to follow along my platform and check out my books. I was definitely shocked that my audience grew large, especially on TikTok! I do think a part of the growth is that I came from this audience to begin with — I was making fan blogs and running fan accounts before I became an author — and it’s very instinctual to me what might get people buzzing and what people wouldn’t really care that much about. Still, I’m always pleasantly surprised when it works!Totally! Fun question for you: What are five things you need by your side when you sit down to write?Oooooh, this one is hard because I’m always lounging around in the weirdest places to write LOL. I would say…a comfy pillow, a good light, maybe a chocolate bar, my water bottle, and my Spotify playlist just hovering in the airwaves.I don’t want to take too much of your day, so I’ll end on this question! How would you describe both of these books using just three emojis?I simply LOVE any emoji question. After careful deliberation, I would say that the These Violent Delights and Our Violent Ends duology is 🥀⚔️🔥Amazing! Chloe, it has been SO fun chatting with you this afternoon, and I am so excited for Our Violent Ends to be out in the world soon! Thank you so much.Thank you for taking the time to chat with me!! It’s been so fun, and I’m VERY excited for the finale to be out in the world, hehe. 🥰

441,"“The issue was photographed and printed prior to the tragic events in Houston,” a spokesperson for W told BuzzFeed News.","Travis Scott has been named in a $750 million lawsuit filed on Tuesday on behalf of 125 Astroworld victims, including the family of one man who died at the festival. Ten people were killed and hundreds of others injured during a deadly crowd surge that took place during Scott’s performance on Nov. 5 at NRG Park, in the rapper’s hometown of Houston. The annual festival was headlined and produced by Scott, and is named after his 2018 album. Sources close to the rapper maintain that he didn’t realize the severity of what was happening in the crowd as he continued to play on for a reported 37 minutes after the show had been declared a mass casualty incident at 9:38 p.m. The new legal complaint was filed in Houston by attorney Tony Buzbee, and follows hundreds of other lawsuits filed by the families of victims and concertgoers alleging ""negligence"" in the wake of the disaster. Among the plaintiffs in Tuesday’s suit is the family of 21-year-old Axel Acosta, who was one of ten attendees who died from injuries sustained during Scott’s headlining performance, when concertgoers were seemingly crushed, suffocated, and trampled by one another as they surged toward the stage. In the complaint, Buzbee alleges that Acosta went into cardiac arrest from being crushed in the crowd “with such force that he could no longer breathe.” An additional member of Buzbee’s legal team also said that Acosta’s death “was needless, and was the result of gross negligence.” The lawsuit states: “When Axel collapsed, he was trampled by those fighting to prevent themselves from being crushed. As he lay there under a mass of humanity, dying, the music played and streamed on — for almost forty minutes.” “Axel Acosta loved and adored Travis Scott and the other performers at Astroworld — the feeling was not mutual,” the legal complaint says. “Certainly, neither Travis Scott nor his exclusive partners, streaming service, record labels, handlers, entourage, managers, agents, hangers on, promoters, organizers, or sponsors cared enough about Axel Acosta and the other concertgoers to make an even minimal effort to keep them safe,” the suit continues. And like many other lawsuits filed against the rapper in the aftermath of the concert, the complaint details alleged past behavior by Scott which they claimed “glorifies violence and other dangerous behaviors,” including his social media activity. The legal suit also states that the $750 million sum is to cover the cost of both physical and mental damage sustained by the victims and families — however, Buzbee emphasized that “no amount of money” will compensate for what they have experienced. “No amount of money will ever make these Plaintiffs whole; no amount of money can restore human life,” the attorney said. “But, the damages sought in this case attempts to fix, help, or make up for the harms and losses suffered by these Plaintiffs — nothing more and nothing less.” Other defendants named in the suit include Apple Music, Epic Records, Scott's Cactus Jack Records, Tri Star Sports and Entertainment Group, and Live Nation — the company responsible for organizing the event. In a statement provided to BuzzFeed News, Buzbee's team explained that his firm “believes, based on its ongoing investigation, that Apple Music, Epic Records and many other corporations that stood to profit from Astroworld will share legal blame in a court of law, in front of a Texas jury.” Also named in the lawsuit is the artist Drake, who joined Scott onstage as a surprise guest. Fan footage from the music festival shows the rapper performing with Scott after an emergency vehicle had already entered the crowd to aid concertgoers who were suffering from injuries. The complaint claims that while Drake does not have such a prolific history of inciting chaos as Scott, he has still “greatly benefitted from [Scott's] ‘sicko’ legacy” and is therefore partly to blame for the disaster. “When [Drake] accepted [Scott's] invitation to perform at Astroworld 2021, [Drake] was well aware of the damage [Scott] had caused at his shows in the past,” Buzbee writes in the suit. “[Drake] was also well aware of the anticipated size and volatility of the crowd, and the likelihood of incitement.” In a statement issued on Nov. 6, Scott said he was “absolutely devastated” by the events that took place at Astroworld and pledged his commitment to “heal and support the families in need.” A spokesperson for Scott also said on Friday that while the rapper felt “he was not responsible” for the tragedy, “he wants to be responsible for the solution.” Scott has since announced that he intends to cover the costs of both the funerals for those who died at the concert, as well as therapy treatment for survivors. On Monday, it was announced by Nike that they have postponed the release of their latest sneaker collaboration with Scott, “out of respect for everyone impacted by the tragic events at the Astroworld Festival.” And now, following suit, W Magazine has decided against digitally promoting an upcoming edition that features Scott, and his partner, Kylie Jenner, on the cover. In a statement provided to BuzzFeed News, a representative for W Magazine confirmed that the Scott–Jenner cover — which also included a new interview with the pair — was shot and printed before the Astroworld incident and would no longer be posted online by the outlet. ""The issue was photographed and printed prior to the tragic events in Houston,"" the spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. ""W will not be posting the cover."" Like Scott, Jenner also found herself at the center of criticism in the wake of the tragedy. Jenner — who is currently expecting her second child with Scott — was in attendance at the fatal concert, and, according to fan footage, was safely situated at the rear of the audience in a VIP section with her sister, Kendall Jenner, as well as her and Scott’s 3-year-old daughter, Stormi. Both Jenner sisters were met with backlash in the days after the festival for sharing Instagram stories of Scott's performance that were then left on their accounts even after news of the mass casualties emerged. One video, which was shared by Kylie, showed an ambulance in the crowd. The video remained live on her account for several hours after the news broke of the fatalities before it was finally deleted. On Nov. 7, Jenner issued a statement on Instagram, emphasizing that she and Scott had not been aware of the fatalities until the news surfaced after the show. “Travis and I are broken and devastated. My thoughts and prayers are with all who lost their lives, were injured or affected in anyway by yesterday's events. And also for Travis who I know cares deeply for his fans and the Houston community,” the billionaire wrote. “I want to make it clear we weren't aware of any fatalities until the news came out after the show and in no world would have continued filming or performing,” she continued. “I am sending my deepest condolences to all the families during this difficult time and will be praying for the healing of everyone who has been impacted,” her statement concluded. According to reports, Scott and Jenner have been staying put at the rapper’s home in Houston since the incident occurred nearly two weeks ago."
442,"“You have a misunderstanding, I’m afraid, of what conspiracy is,” a federal judge told white nationalists Richard Spencer and Christopher Cantwell.","


It was a legal Hail Mary attempt that failed spectacularly.Two white supremacists defending themselves in the Charlottesville federal court on Tuesday had their motions to dismiss a lawsuit against them due to lack of evidence shot down by a judge, who said the plaintiffs had shown proof that they had conspired to commit racially motivated violence at the deadly “Unite the Right” rally in 2017. Advertisement     After the plaintiffs rested their case following three weeks of powerful and often heart-wrenching testimony, notorious alt-right leader Richard Spencer and neo-Nazi podcaster Christopher Cantwell told Judge Norman Moon they hadn’t seen any evidence to suggest they were part of any conspiracy, nor any to prove they had been violent. In fact, they claimed, they had been victims of targeted violence from left-wing “antifa” counterprotesters at the rally they organized to promote “white rights” and an “ethno-state.”The request made by Spencer and Cantwell allows a judge to dismiss a case if they deem there was not enough evidence presented in court to support a guilty verdict.But Moon told the white supremacists there had been plenty of evidence, and that the court was required to view it all in “light most favorable to the plaintiffs.”
 


“How this looks from the standpoint of the law is that in the days leading up to ‘Unite the Right’ you exchanged text messages with defendant Spencer in which you stated, ‘I’m willing to risk a lot for our cause, including violence and incarceration. Many in my audience would follow me there, but I want to coordinate and make sure it’s worth it for our cause,’” Moon told the defendants, reading their own messages to each other back to them in court. “Then Mr. Spencer responded, ‘It’s worth it, at least to me.’”That exchange alone, Moon said, could be enough for a jury to reasonably decide whether the men conspired to commit racially motivated violence. But he presented several other examples of the men speaking with each other about their plans to commit acts of violence in Charlottesville four years ago, including Cantwell discussing the several firearms he had brought with him to the rally.Moon, a straight-shooting 84-year-old with a thick Virginia accent, reminded Spencer and Cantwell how a conspiracy is determined.“You don’t have to do very much. You just get in there, be there, go along with it, support it. You're part of the conspiracy,” Moon told them. “You have a misunderstanding, I’m afraid, of what conspiracy is. It’s a long instruction, but I read it several times [in court].”Moon dismissed the motions and told the defendants to proceed with their cases.Spencer and Cantwell, both without lawyers, spent most of Tuesday afternoon conducting direct examinations of themselves that often veered into the bizarre.Spencer tried to read a lengthy, racist manifesto before Moon scolded him and ordered him to just summarize it. Spencer — who became famous for a 2016 video in which he told a crowd of neo-Nazis “Hail Trump!” — told the jury he was trying to show them that he was “flawed” but not violent.“I am not claiming to you that I have somehow seen the light, and I am now going to speak out against antiracism,” he said. “I am still, no doubt, an ideological radical.”
 


For his defense, Cantwell played a series of shaky videos from the “Unite the Right” torch march on Aug. 11, 2017. He also spouted conspiracy theories about counterprotesters who had allegedly followed him to a Walmart parking lot targeting him for violence.In two especially surreal moments, Cantwell asked himself a question in court and then answered his own question.Before the court adjourned Tuesday, the two sides agreed with Moon to set closing arguments for Thursday. The plaintiffs will get two and a half hours to present their final remarks to the jury, while the defense will get three and a half hours. Moon said he would like to see the jury have all of Friday to deliberate and hopefully come to a decision before the weekend.The lawsuit, brought by the civil rights nonprofit Integrity First for America on behalf of nine plaintiffs, is using the 150-year-old Ku Klux Klan Act to try to hold 24 neo-Nazis and other white supremacists who organized the “Unite the Right” event accountable for what they claim was a conspiracy to commit racially motivated violence. The suit seeks unspecified damages for the mental and physical trauma the plaintiffs experienced four years ago.

443,“I want it to be understood that I’m not scorned. I’m not sad because I didn’t get him as a boyfriend.”,"


Jenny (not her real name), 35, said that a man approached her and said hi while she was walking on the beach with her 9-year-old daughter last September. “He had a mask on, so I didn’t really pay much attention,” she told me. He walked away and then circled back and pulled down his mask. She recognized the actor immediately. David (a pseudonym) was down-to-earth, handsome, and charming. “He started asking me more personal questions about myself and ended up giving me his phone number. I was kind of in disbelief, and I didn’t really know what he wanted,” she said.She said they began DM’ing after she tweeted at him later that day. “He was really nice at first, and he did seem interested in me as a person,” she said. She said she told him about her past experience with abuse and how she had experienced PTSD. “I felt that by doing that, I was letting him know that I wasn’t in a position to be objectified,” she said.About two days later, she recalled, the messages changed in tone. “It was abrupt. It [went] from talking about normal life … and then [he] started requesting very sexual, and — now that I look back at it — very embarrassing things,” she said. She told me he asked for nude photos and explicit videos, which she sent and basked in his attention via Snapchat, phone calls, FaceTime, and texts. Advertisement  They discussed meeting again in real life, but he said he wasn’t interested in a relationship. He said “he [had] just gotten out of one, that he couldn’t be there emotionally,” she told me. “I was OK with that.” But Jenny felt that he was sending mixed messages. “He was insisting he didn’t want a relationship while asking for things you would ask for in a relationship, like exclusivity,” she said. She told him she wasn’t dating anyone else, but he didn’t offer the same on his end. He also asked her not to tell any of her friends about what they were doing. “He [said] he was a really private person and he values his privacy, which I understand because he’s a public figure. But it was also a level of secrecy that made me feel uncomfortable,” she said.Then, she recalled, he asked for something new. “He wanted to do this whole dom-sub thing,” which she said he had never stated outright but implied through his actions. He told her to refer to him as “sir” and to answer his questions with a “yes, sir.” When she had an orgasm over video chat, she had to say his name and then say “thank you” when she was done.Later, she said, he started pestering her for increasingly explicit photos and videos. If she had raised any concerns, she said, rather than address how he was making her feel, he would say things like, “You [said] you were OK with it.” “It really, really messed with my head the whole time because he kept insisting he didn’t want a relationship, but he kept contacting me for months.” She said she stayed in touch with him for nearly a year, assuming that the actor was seeing other women — he was a movie star, after all — but also feeling pressured into doing things she didn’t want to do. Advertisement  Stories like Jenny’s are emblematic of the messy post-#MeToo debates swirling around sex, power, and agency — especially in celebrity–civilian encounters. More and more stories are popping up on social media about these interactions and the complicated feelings women have about them — particularly around expectations of honesty. And perhaps most crucially, women now feel more comfortable uniting with each other to call out the power imbalances. But not everyone agrees on the most effective way to do it or how best to untangle the thorny questions that arise.
 


This summer, Jenny began following Deuxmoi, a crowdsourced celebrity gossip Instagram account. Deuxmoi, which declined to comment for this story, publishes unverified and uncorroborated reader-submitted comments about celebrities, including anything from sightings to purported leaks of information. The account's bio reads, “statements made on this account have not been independently confirmed. this account does not claim any information published is based in fact.” Advertisement  Rebecca Ortiz, an assistant professor at Syracuse University who studies the #MeToo movement and social media, said that accounts like Deuxmoi are useful for women precisely because they can’t be verified. “Somebody with power [is] going to be able to use that power against anybody who is accusing them. … To gain any power back, you have to sometimes go into these anonymous ‘unverified spaces’ because you’re not being heard anywhere else,” Ortiz said. But sharing stories anonymously can lead to backlash. “Voicing those stories in a space that isn’t verified plays into that tendency we have already to question victims and survivors. But it’s not the space itself doing that, it’s our culture. ”It’s possible that untrue accusations of sexual assault could be shared on sites like Deuxmoi; the account has posted tips that later turned out to be false. But a fear of being accused of lying has led many women to keep quiet about assault, Ortiz said. That’s why some are more comfortable sharing their stories anonymously, particularly after the #MeToo movement led them to recognize they weren’t alone, she added.Jenny saw a series of posts about a famous fortysomething actor from an early aughts TV show cavorting around New York City with different women. (We’ll call him John.) The posts featured reader-submitted sightings: John at a downtown hot spot with his arm around a woman, or at a famed restaurant with another woman. Advertisement  These posts contained unverified information from unidentified sources but still inspired passionate conversations. Some readers reveled in the drama of John’s paramours finding out about each other, while others claimed to be the women from the posts, tweeting about being surprised or jokingly suggesting they all meet up because there were so many of them.With claims like these proliferating on the internet, many of them impossible to authenticate, discussing celebrity activities with such fervor might seem trivial or unjustified. But Hilde Van den Bulck, a professor of communication studies at Drexel University, doesn’t think so. “When we talk about celebrities, we’re talking about ourselves,” she said. She has analyzed reader reactions to celebrity sex scandals and found that even though most people begin discussions with comments about the celebrity, they move on to more general issues.
 


Dissecting a famous person’s sex life allows people to “talk about things that are difficult to talk about,” she said. “Even in 2021, talking about sex is still not that [easy]. It may be more easy to talk about [sex] through celebrities.” These conversations allow people to ask, Where do we stand as a society? Should we rethink our norms?One of the women who said she met John over the summer was 24-year-old Casey. She attended an exclusive early aughts–themed party on New York City’s Lower East Side with her 23-year-old friend. John stood out among the sea of beautiful twentysomethings. He approached the pair and asked for Casey’s friend’s number.A few weeks later, Casey said, she ran into the actor at a bar in Brooklyn and he hit on her. “I don’t even think he remembered meeting me when I was with my friend. I think he’s just probably hooked up with a lot of young girls that it probably doesn’t even register,” she said. She turned him down.I asked Casey about the group of Deuxmoi readers who had called John out. While she thought it was weird for someone in his 40s to hang out with people in their 20s, she said women shouldn’t be complaining. “You can’t be like, ‘I’m being taken advantage of,’ because you’re not a child. You’re an adult. You clearly want to date someone with more money.” And she said the power differential works both ways. For example, some women might have wanted to have sex with him because they were Instagram influencers. “Once they find out he’s wealthy and has been on TV, that’s a motivating factor [for them],” she said. “On one [hand], these women are clearly using him for clout. And on the other hand, he’s clearly using them because they’re hot and young, so it’s on both ends a little messed up.”It’s not a new story: women trading youth and beauty for social status, and men using wealth and fame for access to youth and beauty. “Youth and attractiveness is a different type of power,” said Justin Lehmiller, a research fellow who studies the psychology of sex at the Kinsey Institute. “There’s this tendency for the job and the money to be the sole focus of these power conversations, and I don’t think that’s the full picture.”Meanwhile, Deuxmoi began publishing posts from women who were sleeping with other celebrities, and even more stories about the stars flooded in.Jenny was inspired by what she read on Deuxmoi and wondered if other women had had exploitative experiences with David.She tapped out a DM to the account asking if she could connect with other women who’d had encounters with David, which it reposted. Like Deuxmoi’s other Instagram stories, it stayed up for 24 hours before disappearing. She waited by her phone, curious whether anyone would reach out.
 


Celebrities are sexy precisely because they have power and fame; some of their fans crave proximity to that. “The idea of sleeping with a celebrity is a really popular sexual fantasy and one that most people will never have the opportunity to act out,” said Lehmiller. In a comprehensive survey of sexual fantasies published in his book Tell Me What You Want, Lehmiller found that 63% of heterosexual women claimed to have had that desire.Some who do get to interact with celebrities no longer just tell their closest friends about it; they share their stories on social media. In May, a 19-year-old celebrity assistant shared on TikTok a screencap purportedly from her FaceTime call with then–51-year-old actor Matthew Perry after they matched on the dating app Raya, which she thought was “innocent” at the time. She later told Page Six: “It’s not really OK for these older guys to be talking to such young girls.” (Perry did not respond to a BuzzFeed News request for comment.)One impact of the #MeToo movement has been women alleging on social media negative and even abusive experiences they’ve had with celebrities. In some cases, the celebrities have faced consequences. Recent sexual abuse accusations lodged on Twitter against comedian Chris D’Elia led to a lawsuit, his manager dropping him, and him being recast in a movie. (D’Elia denied the allegations.) A former employee of Andrew Cuomo, then the New York governor, made accusations of sexual harassment on Twitter. The governor was investigated by New York’s attorney general and has since resigned. (Cuomo denied the allegations.) Armie Hammer was accused of rape in March by a woman running the Instagram account @houseofeffie. Other women then contacted her, saying Hammer had abused or manipulated them, and she posted screenshots of alleged texts between Hammer and some of these women. (Hammer denied the allegations.) Advertisement  But while most public #MeToo allegations are related to potential crimes, many of the claims surfaced by Deuxmoi neither rise to the level of criminality nor become anything more than an uninvestigated Instagram blip. As one woman who said she was involved with David told me, “This is not a #metoo case, but it is a callout and condemnation for disrespect toward women.”Some readers thought that Deuxmoi’s posts were intrusive. “Why should the general public need to know if any actor sleeps around if they’re doing so legally and consensually? Millions of non famous men do that every day, are we gonna ‘expose’ them too?” one person wrote on a Deuxmoi subreddit (not officially associated with Deuxmoi). Another user chimed in: “Is it a cultural revolution to do the male version of slut-shaming?”Recently, a New York Post article, inspired by Deuxmoi’s posts purportedly about the dating life of Succession actor Nicholas Braun, was called out on Twitter and Reddit for relying on unverified accounts and for dissecting the actor’s alleged liaisons. ""Lol, what’s the story? Pleasant, personable male celebrity has no shortage of women interested in him? If he’s abusive or violent, expose him by all means, but that doesn’t seem to be the case by all accounts, so who cares?” one person wrote on the r/SuccessionTV subreddit. (Braun did not respond to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News.) Advertisement  Lehmiller said that criticizing someone who’s dating several people isn’t necessarily slut-shaming unless the focus is the “sheer number of sexual partners.” If a person isn’t transparent about having many partners, they could be criticized for practicing “unethical nonmonogamy … because the people involved are not consenting to what’s going on. And so then it becomes this violation of trust when they actually find out what’s happening.” But it depends on the circumstances; miscommunication can be a factor in people’s expectations of a romantic connection. “In a lot of relationships, monogamy is just assumed rather than being negotiated and defined,” he said.
 


After Deuxmoi posted her message, Jenny said it wasn’t long before her phone started blowing up. “There were women in the double digits contacting me,” she said. “It was constant.” So she started a group text where the women could compare notes about their experiences with David. One of those women was Madison (whose name has been changed for privacy). The 34-year-old said she met David in fall 2018 while she was working as a marketing and events manager at a private social house in LA and doing sketch comedy on the side. “We genuinely connected over talking about comedy,” she told me. “I was telling someone, ‘I feel like he’s going to mentor me.’”Madison said they started exchanging emails in which he would tell her to have a beautiful day or call her lovely. She recalled that one day he came into the club with his girlfriend and awkwardly introduced them to each other. The girlfriend seemed cold. But the emails continued. “It was all incredibly flattering. … And I was like, OK, maybe he’s not with his girlfriend anymore.”
 


She suggested that they move to texting. But as soon as that started, she claimed, he began acting like a different person. “It felt very Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde.” He began asking for explicit pictures, she recalled, and she asked if he still had a girlfriend. According to her, he said he did but that she was OK with him having this sort of connection with other women. Madison said she declined to send photos but claimed that he kept trying to push their communications into a sexual realm. “I kept either avoiding it or not acknowledging it or [saying,] ‘Hey, I just want to be friends,’” she said. She said she wasn’t sure about his motives. She thought, Is this person still interested in my career? Do they want to help me?She said she eventually stopped communicating with him. Several months later, a new TV show he’d worked on aired. She watched the early episodes and noticed there was a character with her name. “At first I was flattered, but it also just felt kind of messed up because this is someone who has so much power and has an authority over my career — not directly, but it felt like this person was taking everything they could from me, even when I didn't want to give it to them. And then, at the end of it all, he took my name.”When she saw Jenny’s post on Deuxmoi, she decided to get in touch “to see if it maybe would be healing or therapeutic in some way,” she said. What she found disturbed her.
 


In the group chat, Madison discovered that her story about David was actually tame compared to others’. Many of the women said they had experienced manipulation and pressure to have sex with him and make sexual videos for him. They said he continued to ask them to perform sexual acts and record these videos even after they’d refused, and that he had sent messages to many of them for months, persuading them that the more videos they sent, the more extreme the sex acts, the more he would like them. When they’d told David they weren’t comfortable with something sexually, he would talk them out of their hesitancy, they said. “Some men … believe that to get a ‘yes,’ they have to go through a couple ‘no’s first. But is that really a yes? Is that really consent? No, it’s not consent. It’s coercion,” said Rebecca Ortiz, the Syracuse professor.“If you have to talk the woman into doing something she originally says she didn’t want to, that’s pretty messed up,” Jenny said. Some of the women in the group chat claimed that he’d lied to them about being monogamous, possibly putting their sexual health in jeopardy because he’d said he didn’t want to use condoms.“It was pretty overwhelming for all of us,” Jenny said, particularly because some of the women believed that they were dating the actor. Those women “were heartbroken” to find out that there were dozens of others, she said. But the group was cathartic. “Every woman was like, ‘Oh, my gosh, I have clarity I haven’t had, and I’ve been just suffering. I’ve talked to friends, to family, and nobody can give me that clarity, because nobody knows what it’s like, especially to have gone through it with the same person,’” she said. “In sharing our experiences, we really felt validated. … It was so relieving for all of us, like, we’re not crazy. We’re not being too emotional.” Advertisement  Not all the women in the group shared negative comments about David. Jenny recalled that one person said she’d had “a pleasant experience” but was respectful of the others. “They were still very supportive of validating and listening to the ones that did have different experiences,” Jenny said. “Nobody was like, ‘Oh, well, that’s not what I had. He’s just a nice guy.’ It was like, ‘I’m so sorry that that happened.’”Jenny and Madison believe David’s behavior with them was coercive. Andrew Pari, a counselor and expert on sexual trauma, said some of the behavior outlined by the women I spoke to could fall within what some psychologists refer to as a “gray area” of consent — and that men are usually aware when a woman doesn’t completely consent. For instance, Pari said, a man asking for explicit pictures and videos after a woman said no, even if she eventually agreed, could be construed as coercive.But according to legal experts, that doesn’t amount to assault. “Verbal ‘coercion’ just by constant pleading or persuasion isn’t enough for rape or any other crime,” Stephen J. Schulhofer, an New York University law professor who studies rape and consent law, told me in an email. “Only if the verbal coercion is a threat of physical injury, then it’s rape.” Advertisement     Susan Estrich, a law professor at the University of Southern California, gave this hypothetical. “If he finally said, ‘I’ll kill you if you don’t do it,’ [then that’s assault],” she said. But if he said, “‘Can I ask one more time?’ And she said, ‘Oh, alright,’ that’s known as persuasion.”Still, Pari said, the cultural conversation around #MeToo hasn’t caught up to the nuances of coercion, exploitation, and abuse. He said a person would be acting ethically if they explained that they were not interested in a relationship and acted accordingly. “But if he’s seriously dating and acting like there’s a deep relationship forming when there isn’t, then that’s abusive and coercive,” Pari said. “Most predators will use the least invasive method of getting what they want so that they can create the false impression in the mind of their victim that they were consenting and complicit,” he said.The conversation about consent has come a long way. “I used to fight with people literally about whether no meant yes,” Estrich said. “Now, I think everybody agrees that no means no.” But, Estrich said, both conduct and context matter. “The fact that sex may be inappropriate doesn’t mean it’s unlawful ... unless it’s nonconsensual. And traditionally the law required force or threat of force.” However, she cautioned, “I don’t think we want to infantilize women. We don’t want to assume that we’re not capable of acting as autonomous people.” Advertisement     
 


Madison was troubled not just by the claims in the group chat but also by how the other women felt about David’s alleged actions. “Women seem really upset and afraid of him, and afraid about talking about it or going forward or doing anything with it,” she said. So she and Jenny decided to take action. “I don’t want him to keep doing this to women,” she said. “I kind of feel like I have a responsibility to try to do something or share this information.” Madison and Jenny drafted a statement on behalf of the group:[David] is an extremely manipulative person whose actions have caused emotional distress, trauma and fear to many of the women with whom he has engaged with. He has even put some of these women’s physical wellbeing into question. He has used sexual coercion and fame to take advantage of women and satisfy his own desires, with little or no regard to the emotional and at times physical safety of his partners. Advertisement     They hoped to post it on Deuxmoi, but the account declined. One woman who told me she had a sexual relationship with David claimed that he “has herpes and did not disclose that to [her] or any women he was romantically involved with.” She added, “This is not just bad behavior, it’s also a crime in California.” (Under California law, knowingly passing on a sexually transmitted infection is a misdemeanor. Schulhofer, the NYU law professor, said that transmitting an STD can be considered a crime; however, in California and most states, “the defendant has to INTEND to transmit the STD,” he wrote in an email.) She also said that David is aware of the group chat “and he tried to turn the women in this group against one another (unsuccessfully of course).”Jenny is aware that they could be dismissed as a group of women motivated by heartache and revenge. But they wanted to highlight the real-life experiences of unequal sexual relationships. “I want it to be understood that I’m not scorned. I’m not sad because I didn’t get him as a boyfriend,” she said.They also aren’t interested in ruining his career. “I just don’t really want women to be treated this way,” Madison said. “I feel like there needs to be an education in our society that just because someone isn’t raping women doesn’t mean what they’re doing is OK.” Advertisement     These kinds of stories have allowed women who are grappling with questions about power and sexual agency to realize that their experiences are not unusual. “The #MeToo movement has emboldened [these] women to say, ‘Yes, we can group together and be a force,’” Van den Bulck said. But that doesn’t necessarily make it any easier to untangle the dynamics of a celebrity–civilian relationship.The way we think about celebrity–civilian relationships has shifted dramatically over the past decade. Tasha R. Howe, a psychology professor at Humboldt State University who studied rock groupies from the 1980s, found in a 2014 study that most of the ’80s heavy metal groupies she surveyed did not regret having sex with rock stars. Seventy-eight percent of respondents did not feel that band members had “used them.” One former groupie told the researchers: “We all knew what we were doing. … We had no strings attached; everyone kind of used each other. … Everyone was young, having fun. … I never felt used or even disrespected.”The 1980s were “a very different time in terms of acceptance of casual sex,” Lehmiller said.“There’s a lot more expectation of accountability for bad sexual behavior [now], even if it’s not in the realm of sexual assault, but [rather] somebody who is engaging in behavior that feels exploitative or manipulative in some way,” he said. “I think people today are much more inclined to want to see that person held accountable for their actions than they were in the past. And I think that’s partially a product of #MeToo and these conversations we’ve been having lately around sexual consent.” Advertisement     “When a guy that’s powerful in Hollywood promises a model or actress to help her get a part in the film and she sleeps with them, what do you call that?” Estrich asked. “How far do we want to go in saying that sexuality cannot be an element of a bargain? And at what point does pressure of one sort or another make sex nonconsensual? … We do need to talk about these gray areas. They’re legitimate questions. And right now people are afraid to discuss them.”Madison hopes these stories expand the scope of what behavior we deem unacceptable from celebrities. “Our culture at large does not really recognize [this kind of behavior] as abusive,” she said. “I really want some kind of spotlight to be put on predatory behavior in celebrities and people in powerful positions. And I know that the #MeToo movement has brought a lot of that, but it’s not enough. I just think that we’re still so far behind understanding these dynamics of manipulation and coercion and abuse and how nuanced they can be.”“What I want to see [from the collective],” Jenny said, “is a floodgate of women just being like, ‘Here’s my experience, and I’m finally free from this. I can finally speak my truth and be believed and be heard.’” Advertisement     After starting the group chat, Jenny said she called off her relationship with David via text and told him how harmful his behavior was. In his response, she said, he claimed he’d never wanted to hurt her and acknowledged her pain, but added that she was being harsh in how she was judging his actions. Then, she said, he followed up with another message, offering to have a video call to clear things up. He tried to video call her, she said; she did not respond. ●

445,“Can you guys conceal carry? I don’t want to scare antifa off from throwing the first punch… I want them to start something.”,"


CHARLOTTESVILLE, Virginia — As the plaintiffs in the landmark federal lawsuit against two dozen neo-Nazis and other white supremacists who organized the “Unite the Right” rally called their final witnesses, they zeroed in on the alleged calls for violence in the run-up to the event, presenting organizers’ own message threads as evidence.Plaintiffs’ attorney Karen Dunn on Tuesday called to the stand Jason Kessler, a white nationalist, member of the Proud Boys, and one of the primary “Unite the Right” organizers. The attorney spent hours Tuesday confirming and walking Kessler through his extensive communications with other white nationalists and neo-Nazis in the months, weeks, and days leading up to Aug. 11 and 12, 2017. Those communications — over social messaging platforms including Facebook and Discord, as well as by phone and text message — made clear that Kessler was looking to draw like-minded people from across the US to Charlottesville. In one post, he promised it would be “the biggest Alt-Right event of the year.” Advertisement     He also referred to the rally in fighting terms, saying it would go down in history as “the Battle of Charlottesville.” Many of his messages discussed violence and provoking antiracist counterprotesters as a means to not only foment a race war, but also get media attention.“We need a new way to tip off antifa when we want them to show up somewhere,” read one message that Kessler wrote to other white nationalists. “We definitely want to play these people into our hands Saturday in Charlottesville.”In that same online discussion, Kessler spoke about the need to hide weapons while in public and his expectation that at least some attendees would be packing firearms.“Can you guys conceal carry? I don’t want to scare antifa off from throwing the first punch. Big scary guns...will keep Antifa away. I want them to start something,” Kessler wrote. “Lots of armed military vets in attendance so we aren’t going to be lacking for firepower.” Advertisement     The planning of violence is key to the case of nine plaintiffs, who are suing for damages to compensate for the injuries they sustained in August 2017 as well as to punish the rally organizers. Brought on the plaintiffs’ behalf by the civil rights nonprofit Integrity First for America, the lawsuit is using the 150-year-old Ku Klux Klan Act to try to hold some or all of 24 of the most notorious white nationalist figures and organizations in the US accountable for alleged racially motivated violence.Over the course of three weeks, the plaintiffs have laid out their case that the rally planning amounted to a conspiracy; they have testified about the physical and psychological injuries they experienced and still struggle with; and they have used a mountain of digital evidence to show the extent to which the group of white supremacists went to allegedly get the fight they were after.The jury is expected to hear from defense witnesses as early as Tuesday. So far, defense statements at trial have ranged from bizarre rants to hate speech. Unable to afford lawyers, some of the white supremacists are representing themselves, using their time in court to broadcast their extremist ideologies as well as grievances with their fellow defendants.
 


Neo-Nazi podcaster Christopher Cantwell, who is defending himself in the trial, also took the stand Monday. The plaintiffs played episodes of his podcast that aired before “Unite the Right,” including one in which he interviewed Andrew ""Weev"" Auernheimer of the neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer. In the interview, Auernheimer calls for a race war and praises neo-Nazi mass murderer Dylann Roof. Advertisement     “I fucking like you… You’re awesome,"" Cantwell tells Weev after listening to him rant.Social media posts by Cantwell in which he used racist and violent language were also shown to the jury. One read, “America won’t be free until the last kike is strangled with the entrails of the last Democrat.”The plaintiffs also played a clip from a Vice News interview in 2017, in which Cantwell shows off the arsenal of firearms he had brought to “Unite the Right.”In the process of presenting their case, the plaintiffs have also indirectly exposed how the ties among the white nationalists have frayed since the lawsuit was filed against them. During cross-examinations when some of the pro se defendants — those who are representing themselves — have interrogated their codefendants, things have turned heated.In one testy exchange Monday, white nationalist Richard Spencer asked Kessler on the stand about Kessler’s public criticism of him.“So when did you determine that I was a sociopathic narcissist?"" Spencer asked Kessler, a term the latter had used in a 2019 tweet.“You were just despicable to everyone you ever came in contact with... You were like a robot, like a serial killer,” Kessler answered.Kessler, his voice raised at Spencer, continued, saying that Spencer had accused him “of being a Jew because I wouldn’t ‘Sieg Heil’ with you,” referring to the Nazi salute.Spencer, glancing nervously at the jury and then down at his notes, responded before ending his questioning a moment later: “That’s — that's enough, Jason.”

447,"It’s not merely Pete Davidson’s New York, it’s Pete Davidson’s America — and we’re all just living in it.","



 


On paper, Pete Davidson is a comedian. He performs stand-up, appears on Comedy Central roasts, and shows up periodically on Saturday Night Live, where he shivers his way through “Weekend Update” monologues that are mostly about how much Staten Island hates him. I like Pete as a comedian, sure; his last movie was pretty good, and he remains a good counterbalance to Michael Che, whose anti-trans jokes are as boring as they are unfunny. But the context where he really thrives — this specter-like Dennis the Menace, this hipster Babadook, this sexy, slouching, shapeless tuft of sea salt mist — is as a strange yet perfect celebrity oddity.The last time I wrote about Pete, it was the summer of 2018. We were innocent then: Davidson was a relatively new name in our collective celebrity consciousness, his then-girlfriend Ariana Grande kept looking at him as if he were a Dum Dums sucker that she wanted to crack in half with her wisdom teeth, and it seemed everyone had an opinion on the exciting if perplexing energy radiating from his narrow pelvic girdle. But now, god, we are so old: Pete and Ariana are no more (who could’ve imagined that a woodland nymph and the boy from your eighth-grade class who turned apples into bongs at lunch would not last), Pete’s relationships have remained high profile if less frequently Instagrammed (Phoebe Dynevor, Kate Beckinsale, Margaret Qualley), and he’s been sloughing off all those glorious tattoos that make him look like the underside of a driver’s ed desk. He’s becoming serious, I guess — more movie roles and less personal drama. Honestly, it’s a shame: Hollywood has enough funny-but-sad actors, but what we really need is a straight-up weirdo.But then he gave us a gift over Halloween weekend. There he was, holding hands with Kim Kardashian West, our generation’s Cher (do with that what you will), in photos that they must have known would soon become public. I had a lot of hopes and dreams for 2021, especially after over a year of worrying about the future, feeling increasingly certain that I would never experience raw, unbridled joy again. What I did not have on my vision board was Kimberly Kardashian West and Peter Michael Davidson perhaps taking each other to a sexy catacomb to boneyard it up while we all watched, unsure whether we wanted this or not. (Turns out, we did. We did.)Look, I am very sick, and I love Pete’s whole creepy-crawly vibe. I don’t know why! I’m just as disturbed by it as you are! But I cannot possibly be alone. Maybe it’s time for all of us to accept the truth — that the best version of Pete’s celebrity is so messy and bizarre that you can’t help but root for him. I’ll watch him as he becomes a prestigious dramedy actor, which somehow already feels inevitable, but the more he grows up, the more I will miss his romantic anarchy. At least he still looks like a Gen Z Edward Scissorhands who I would pay to just splice me into pieces. Advertisement     I don’t actually think these two are dating. I think they’re two of the most shrewd attention-getters in modern American culture, which I offer as a profound compliment. They’re likely connected not just through Kim’s recent SNL appearance, but also through the emo ghouls Pete hangs out with — Machine Gun Kelly, who is friends with Travis Barker, who is now engaged to Least Interesting To Look At Kardashian Sister™ Kourtney. This probably isn’t an earnest love connection, but rather the linking of two geniuses who know that a tremendous amount of harmless, delightful, free press will come their way if they just hold hands. Even once.It only took a few photos at a haunted house for Page Six to breathlessly report that Kim was recently in “Pete Davidson’s native NYC,” as if that’s the only thing New York could possibly offer. The city should change its tourism slogan. “I ❤️ NYC” had a good run, but by the spring, I hope to see stalls in Times Square selling shirts that say “A RAT TOUCHED MY BARE LEG IN PETE DAVIDSON’S NEW YORK CITY!”But just because I don’t think they’re dating doesn’t mean that I don’t desperately want the rumors to be true, with every fiber of my being.It’s just such a bad idea, this pairing, sure to be a loud, public, ugly disaster. They are a perfect awful couple, just like Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox, or Kourtney and Travis. It would be two people who do not seem to operate in the real world whatsoever, dating like mere mortals. You want that too, even if you can’t admit it. You’re not above this, you’re not better than this, and you’re not too cool to derive pleasure from the most aggressively lawless celebrity pairing since Pete and Ariana. (She released a song that was just...his name! Then she broke up with him!!! IT’S PRACTICALLY CAMP.)It’s just too good to not engage with, even while being patently absurd. Imagine Kim’s cavernous, empty, macabre all-taupe bedroom (ideally with those awful blanched pumpkins she puts out for Halloween) where a shirtless Pete Davidson in a Supreme beanie is hunched over, connecting a Nintendo Switch so he can teach Kim how to fight as Incineroar in Super Smash Bros. Meanwhile, Kim is swanning around wearing Skims, chin to toe, sucking on a raspberry-avocado smoothie, digging seeds out of her teeth with a gold-plated AMEX. (It’s vegan! So is the smoothie.) Advertisement     It’s perfect because it’s nuts. Only Pete could give us such a gift — and this close to Diwali too!Such is the pleasure of watching Pete Davidson’s life choices, which are part chaos, part exacting precision. Dating Kim would be bananas, but it would also be an incredible power move in literally every way possible. He seems to understand the machinations of celebrity almost as well as she does, a comprehension where nothing matters, everything is stupid, and even ill-fated decisions remain absolutely delectable. And unexpected though it is, it appears that I’m bound to spend my 30s feeling sexually disoriented over a man who looks like what would happen if The Crow were a documentary.I don’t want much in this life, just an opportunity to sit and hand-feed him children’s multivitamin gummies to keep his energy up. (Does he eat? I don’t know — can ghosts eat, even if only for the sheer hedonism of it all?)The world is too hot for us to survive it much longer. The country can’t agree to all just shut up and get a free lifesaving vaccine. I’m once again thinking too much about Yolanda Hadid, which forces me to think about her clear fridge. Nothing matters; everything is pain. At least Pete Davidson is doing the heavy lifting of bringing us all a little mess, a little stupid drama, a thick little nugget of absurdity. I hope he lives forever, and considering the fact that he looks like the too-tall lead in a zombie Tuck Everlasting, he absolutely will. ●

448,"Ezra Blount, believed to be the Astroworld tragedy’s youngest victim, was at the festival with his dad.","


Ezra Blount, a 9-year-old who is believed to be the youngest victim of the Astroworld tragedy, has died following injuries he sustained at the music festival.His death was confirmed in a statement by attorney Ben Crump, who had initially filed a million-dollar lawsuit on behalf of the Blount family against rapper Travis Scott and organizer Live Nation alleging ""grossly negligent conduct"" at the event. Advertisement     ""The Blount family tonight is grieving the incomprehensible loss of their precious young son,” Crump said. “This should not have been the outcome of taking their son to a concert, what should have been a joyful celebration. Ezra’s death is absolutely heartbreaking.""Nine other concertgoers, including a 14-year-old and a 16-year-old, died after a crowd surged toward the stage on Nov. 5, the first day of the two-day festival.
 


Ezra and his father, Treston Blount, were among a crowd of 50,000 who attended the sold-out Astroworld festival, which ended in tragedy after a crowd surge crushed concertgoers as Scott performed.The boy sustained severe damage to his brain, kidney, and liver after being ""kicked, stepped on, and trampled, and nearly crushed to death,"" according to the lawsuit filed by his family.In a GoFundMe created to cover Ezra’s medical bills, Treston recalled his final moments with his son.“I had my son on my shoulders awaiting Drake's stage appearance,” he wrote. “I began to be crushed until I couldn’t breathe. I passed out and I woke up and my son was gone.”Ezra was discovered at a hospital in Houston where he had been admitted as a John Doe, according to Rolling Stone.
 


His injuries included severe swelling in the back of his brain and severe organ damage.“I am saddened to learn of Ezra’s death this evening. Our city tonight prays for his mom, dad, grandparents, other family members and classmates at this time,” Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said in a statement.Astroworld promoter Live Nation said, “We are heartbroken by this news and our deepest sympathies go out to the family and friends,” in a statement to BuzzFeed News.Travis Scott did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

449,Buckingham Palace announced that Queen Elizabeth II sprained her back and was unable to attend a ceremony honoring fallen veterans for Remembrance Day.,"


After weeks of resting at the advice of her doctors, Queen Elizabeth II has sprained her back, Buckingham Palace told the BBC on Sunday.The injury was announced just hours before what would have been her first public event since being hospitalized last month. The Queen had planned to attend a ceremony for Remembrance Day, a day that commemorates fallen members of the armed services, much like Memorial Day in the US. Advertisement     The 95-year-old royal, who joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service during World War II, was reportedly ""disappointed"" to miss it. The Remembrance Day ceremony has consistently been part of her schedule, and a royal biographer told the Associated Press she considers it one of her most important events every year.In her place, Prince Charles laid a wreath on her behalf at the Cenotaph in London.
 


In recent weeks, the Queen's health has been the subject of concern.Last month, she was reportedly hospitalized for medical tests and ""reluctantly"" canceled a planned trip to Northern Ireland after doctors advised her to rest. She also did not travel to the UN Climate Change Conference, COP26, in Scotland, appearing instead by video message to urge leaders to act now for future generations.In a press conference Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he saw the Queen on Wednesday and ""wanted to reassure everybody"" that she was ""very well.""Next year, the Queen will mark her Platinum Jubilee for an unprecedented 70 years on the British throne.

450,"Ming Smith took photos of New York culture for decades. Now, she’s getting her due.","


Ming Smith is an artist, photographer, and model who has been working since the 1970s. Born in Detroit to artistic parents, she began modeling at a young age and first came to New York on a go-see, where she met members of the acclaimed Kamoinge Workshop. “I heard photographers debating over whether photography was an art form, or whether it was nostalgia,” she said. “That was my first introduction to Kamoinge, and my introduction to photography as an art form.”Smith’s work, which was inducted into the Museum of Modern Art when she was in her 20s, has in recent years gained much wider name recognition. Last year, her monograph was recognized as one of the best photo books of the year, and her work is currently being shown at Nicola Vassell Gallery in Chelsea, one of the rare art galleries in New York owned by a Black woman. “[Nicola and I] had a love affair with one another immediately, our energies clicked,” Smith said. “This was a vision that she had before, and I was just waiting for her to do it. I wanted to give her the utmost support besides loving her.” Advertisement  “Ming is a legend; it's very simple,” Nicola Vassell said. “She is a symbol of everything that has been shrouded over the years that needs to be revealed. In a way she is a sage, and all of her perspectives are important for this moment.”Smith is one of two gallery artists at Nicola Vassell and is working on her upcoming book, August Moon.
 


How did you discover photography?My father worked as a pharmacist during the day and lived as an artist at night up until when I was 11 years old. He pretty much stopped photography when he started working double shifts seven days a week. Photography surrounded me: my father's dark room in the basement; uncles and friends talking shop about light meters, exposures, or camera formats; or outings to Joe Modes Camera in downtown Columbus, where I grew up. There were six Black students in my kindergarten class, and I photographed them on my first day of school with a Brownie camera that I borrowed from my mother. I took photos on school outings and special occasions. Remember, there were no cellphones — the only other times I experienced being or seeing anyone take photos was for class photos by the local commercial photo studios.In the early 1970s, I moved to New York City. The Museum of Modern Art had an open call, so I dropped my portfolio off. John Szarkowski, the iconic photography curator, recognized my talent and wanted to purchase two [pieces] for their permanent collection. I was in my 20s, I wore jeans, a dark brown bomber jacket, and lived and looked like the West Village. I was coming out of the Black Power movement, the mother of the Black Arts movement, so the energy and commitment was strong. When I gave my name to pick up my portfolio, the receptionist who initially had mistaken me for a messenger smiled and with utmost RESPECT (Aretha Franklin) asked me to have a seat. Advertisement  Susan Kismaric, a curator in the department of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, came out and escorted me to their office and told me how amazing, talented, and exceptionally unbelievable my work was. There were perhaps seven selections laid out on the table, and they said they could only buy two and asked me which ones would I like them to have in their permanent collection. I chose one Black image — a Black jazz musician — and another which to me represented true beauty and masterly quality work that anyone could relate to, like a poem.When she quoted a price, I naively felt betrayed, for it was barely enough to pay for my supplies, and this was MoMA. She explained artists try to give them work and their works are refused. I still said no, then [she] asked me if she could keep the two pieces over the weekend and for me to think about it. I told my then-husband and he said go get that money.
 


Did your career change at all after that point, being in the collection at the MoMA?Not really. I never really told anyone. Who was there to tell? Maybe a few friends or family who soon became not friends. But there was one major change for me — validation. Being accepted by a renowned curator and the MoMa staff and having been acknowledged for my talent. That validation as an artist gave me conviction, fortitude, and meaning to continue my path. I was aware of the struggle, but now, with that validation, it meant a lot.What was it like being involved with Kamoinge?Kamoinge came out of the Black Power movement. I was one of the younger photographers, and the only woman. Roy DeCarava started the group, but he wasn't active when I joined. We spent a lot of time looking at images and critiquing, trying to change them, and to have another point of view from what the media was showing us. Now, with cellphone and iPhone photography, it's easier. But then, there weren't that many images of us, and they were mostly negative images. They didn't show the love and humanity of our people, despite the poverty. [I] never saw images of our great culture anywhere, anywhere. Advertisement  Kamoinge wanted to take control of our image, and that led me to really want to photograph not only our own people but other artists. I have a huge catalog of artists who are great contributors to the culture of America.
 


This was the community in New York at the time.Yes, exactly. I loved and photographed Katherine Dunham, Lavinia Williams, Alvin Ailey, [Romare] Bearden, Elizabeth Catlett, Pharoah Sanders, Betty Carter, [James] Baldwin, Henry LeTang, Gordon Parks, Mert Simpson, the Negro Ensemble, Steve Cannon, on and on and on. I now feel it was a spiritual calling. I wasn't taking these photographs to sell them; they were just part of my life and my culture because these were beautiful people.What was something that you knew you wanted to accomplish with your photography?Well, I'm working on a book titled August Moon inspired by the characters [of] August Wilson, a playwright. His characters spoke to my heart and soul and brought memories of my childhood — a certain place in time. My grandparents and parents would tell stories or recite poems like [those by] Paul Laurence Dunbar; it’s my most cherished memory. In New York, I discovered the book Sweet Flypaper of Life, a collaboration between Roy DeCarava and Langston Hughes. I wanted to do a similar collaboration.I took a Greyhound bus to the Hill District of Pittsburgh, which is where Wilson was from. I met his sister — this was in the ’90s — and I asked her where his dreaming place was. I went all around with her. I took pictures, and different references, and he talks about Aunt Esther, who was a spiritual medicine doctor. I photographed characters who I thought might be these characters in his plays. Advertisement  
 


The whole time you were photographing, how were you supporting yourself?Once in a while, I'd have small gigs. I worked for Encore magazine, Ida Lewis — she was trying to start a Black Newsweek. But I mainly [made money] through my modeling. I would get a gig, and then I could live off that one gig for six months, or sometimes a year. I did a hair commercial and it ran on Soul Train — that paid my rent for a long, long time. And I had all of that other time to do my photography work. Almost all of my money, and I mean all of my money, went to basics, and printing paper, supplies, or films. Advertisement  When has there been a time when you felt like you've made it?Sometimes I look at my bank account or I receive a check. But the truth of it is, both my mother and father have passed since I've had some success, and it really saddens me. Now I think, Was I doing this because I wanted to, or did I want to make my mother happy and proud and make them feel like their sacrifice meant something? When she died, she saw me as a struggling artist, and I'm unhappy about that. It was always a childhood dream to be really successful. I understood the struggle and the sacrifice they gave, so the success now is bittersweet. It was just a little bit sad that it was too late. I'm grateful that I have a son who understands and supports and is there for me. If it wasn't for him, I don't know if I would have this much success.Wow. What do you think of the next generation, the young Black artists whose work is being recognized now?I always say stay in the art; keep doing the work, following the vision. Staying in the art will be a way of surviving life's many ups and downs — a lifesaver. You can dream; there are courses and universities and institutions that can help you achieve your desires and dreams. There’s a support system there; we didn’t really have a support system at such a young age; it's a new day. I recently saw a documentary on Gordon Parks called Choice of Weapons. I am proud and happy for the young and new generation of Black artists; they are serious and committed to change for the betterment of humanity. Advertisement

451,"Britney Spears may be free of her conservatorship, but our investigation revealed she isn’t an isolated story. ","
All three nightmares share a common cause: These people had been placed under the care — and control — of legal guardians. America’s guardianship system was designed as a last resort to be used only in the rare and drastic event that someone is totally incapacitated by mental or physical disability. In those cases, conscientious guardians can provide vital support, often in complex and distressing circumstances. But an investigation by BuzzFeed News has found that the system has grown into a vast, lucrative, and poorly regulated industry that has subsumed more than a million people, many of whom insist they are capable of making their own decisions, and placed them at risk of abuse, theft, and even death.
The #FreeBritney movement has drawn international attention to the case of Britney Spears, and wrongdoing by individual guardians has surfaced in the past, but our investigation reveals the systemic failings behind these isolated stories.

452,I thought I was ashamed of my body because the straight world told me to be. But it wasn’t that simple.,"


The first time I wore a crop top was at the 2016 Toronto Dyke March. I’d found the tube of rosy pink sequins at a thrift shop, and I wore it with a pair of jorts hiked up to my waist, gold glitter smeared across my cheeks.I marched down the street with the strip of my stomach that had never before been touched by the sun fully bared. The only thing separating that outfit from any other I might have worn was three or four measly inches of exposed skin — but you have to understand the weight of those inches. Advertisement  I don’t have a body that’s supposed to wear crop tops. Your body shouldn’t limit your fashion choices, of course, but I’m sure you know exactly what I mean.I’m fat. Like, in a size 22 kind of way. Over the years, my relationship with my body — along with my weight and how I take care of myself — has had its ups and downs. Either I was a curvy goddess or absolutely everything a woman wasn’t supposed to be. Fat women aren’t allowed to be neutral about our bodies. We embrace or belittle, eat or starve — and everyone knows what the general societal preference is in that dichotomy.So, for me, crop tops are political. They’re rebellion, liberation. A pale and pudgy fuck-you to the beauty standards I’m exhausted of being exhausted by. And it’s only at the Dyke March that I felt okay to do it. Advertisement  
 


I came out at 23 after years of shame surrounding my feelings about women. I’d spent those years dating men, experiencing the sort of body shame only heteronormative romance can bring. Was I skinny enough to date? Did he only like me because he has a fat girl fetish?When I stopped feeling ashamed of my queerness, I thought I would stop feeling ashamed of my body at the same time. Part of if it was my sudden freedom from the male gaze. In her new self-released comedy special, Rape Jokes, Cameron Esposito talks about coming out and realizing that being gay meant upending the whole way women are valued.When you are raised female, when you are cultured female, the thing that you are valued for, the thing that you are taught you are valued for is your fuckability. That’s it.So I was also realizing that the whole system, the system set up to evaluate whether or not I have value, I was going to be opting out of for the rest of my life, because of the person that I was.She concludes that it’s a confusing thing to manage, especially when you’re young and isolated in your queerness. And that’s true — but it’s also freeing. That system is a piece of shit and you get to turn your back on it. You get to define your value. It’s one of the many gifts queerness brought me.So there I was, a fresh baby gay, convinced that I’d evolved beyond hating my body just because the straight world told me to. But I was wrong.
 


When I first started having sex with women, one of the first things that hit me — other than that I should’ve done this sooner, because wow — was how obsessed I was with other women’s bodies.All women are, to some extent, aren’t we? But it’s different when you’re up close and intimate, when you can run your hands up and down every curve and plane. The easy vulnerability of a naked woman lounging on a tousled bed next to you after sex is beautiful in a way I had no idea to expect.The first few women I was with had bodies like mine — large and fleshy and luxurious. Being with them, as close as you can be physically with another person, gave me a new appreciation of my own body. If I could look at and touch these women with fondness and attraction and lust, then I believed they could do the same with me.There’s something magical in that — being two women whose bodies are considered too much, too undisciplined, too far outside the accepted norm, pleasuring one another for the sake of pleasure itself. That’s a revolution in a bed, as far as I’m concerned.Then, I met Amanda.Amanda messaged me first on OkCupid four years ago. Now, she says she doesn’t remember who bit the bullet, but I know it was her, because I would have never dared. Advertisement  
 


Amanda was hot the way the hottest girl in your high school class was hot. One of her profile pictures was her in a bodysuit for a Lara Croft Halloween costume. I thought she’d made a mistake or was a bot, but no — she messaged me, and she wanted to get dinner.She was a few minutes late to our first date, and it felt like hell. The horrible thought that ran through my mind was that she’d reviewed my photos again and changed her mind. But then she arrived.It was a good date. A great date, even. We got tipsy on cocktails and Amaro aperitifs, and when we said goodbye I chickened out and hugged her, still afraid she’d realized her mistake. On the cab ride home I texted her and said I’d wished I’d kissed her. She agreed.The first time we had sex it was sweaty, and sensual, and hot. But we weren’t alone. Despite all my one-woman pride parade confidence, the male gaze had slipped back into the bedroom, as if for a horrible threesome I’d never asked for.The way another woman’s body mirrored my own had brought me a sense of comfort before, but here I was with a woman more conventionally attractive than me. By which, of course, I mean she was much thinner.I remember her on top of me. My thumbs ran along her hip bones, whereas mine were buried under flesh and fat. Her breasts were round and pert, but mine were unruly, drooping with weight. Her smooth, flat stomach slid on top of my rolls. She had a little pale heart on her hip, a mark left by a sticker when she went tanning — the type of shit hot girls do, I thought. And I, in that moment, did not feel like a hot girl.I kept thinking she’d made a mistake, like she was suddenly going to realize she’d brought a fat person home and kindly ask me to leave. I remember fighting the urge to cover my stomach with a pillow on the way to the bathroom, as if she hadn’t looked at me the whole time we were in bed.I didn’t just feel like crap about my body, but that I’d let any bit of hetero beauty norms invade my sex life. Not only was I tearing apart my own body, which I’d been so inspired to love all over again — I was reducing the woman I was with to nothing more than a collection of parts. In that dark place, all we were was two bodies ripe for comparison. It was scary how easy it was to judge myself against her, even in the middle of getting each other off.Wasn’t I supposed to be done with this shit?
 


If I’d had some self-compassion at the time, I could have remembered that none of this is my fault. Baby gay me had convinced myself, so sweetly, that embracing my queerness would propel me into some parallel universe where bodies are just bodies. Where there’s no moral value assigned to amounts of flesh, where thinness isn’t always a virtue. Where we all just love and fuck each other and bask in our liberation.Cute, right?But that’s not the world we live in. The same beauty norms that had dragged me through a lifetime of self-esteem yo-yoing, and disordered eating, and shame no one deserves followed me right out of the closet.I was taught to value thinness the same way I was taught to value straightness. The two aren’t so different, really. Both have been enforced in every piece of media, every movie, every TV show I’ve consumed since I was a kid, from the time I saw the first of many Disney princesses with a waist thinner than her head. You could be dumb, or unkind, or boring, or unfunny, but none of that really mattered as long as you were thin and straight.
 


As a teenager, I was convinced I was choosing to be fat because I was too weak, too undisciplined to be thin. And I was convinced that as long as I kept choosing men, I would never have to deal with how very gay I was. Neither of these things was truly a choice, but the world around me convinced me that I was fully in control of both things.These rules and assumptions didn’t just apply to me, but to every other woman. We all exist on a value spectrum: the thinner and straighter, the better. On one end is the perfect partner, the perfect daughter, the perfect woman. And we’re constantly assessing each other to figure out where we fall on that spectrum, whether we want to or not. To this day I still fight the need to look at other fat women and wonder whether I’m smaller or larger than them — better or worse, hotter or notter. That’s the order we’ve been taught to uphold.
 


But those doubts all faded, with time, with community, and with a hell of a lot of work on loving myself. It would have been super nice if coming out of the closet was enough to fix everything and shed all that shame. But it didn’t, and I should’ve known it wouldn’t.So even though I could proudly walk in the middle of the street in a shiny crop top, even though coming out liberated my body, my queerness didn’t save me from my insecurities. And that’s okay.Over time, I got better at loving both my queerness and my body, transferring the joy I felt on the street at that first Dyke March in 2016 into joy in bed. There was no magical formula for it, but immersing myself in a queer community was instrumental. I surrounded myself with hard femmes and soft butches, glittering genderqueer dates and androgynous pals. Their bodies came in every size and every gender presentation, and I found a place where my body fit exactly as it was.I began to appreciate the way nails leave half-moon impressions in my dimply thighs, and how my hips look spilling out of lingerie, and how having a nonstandard body was beautiful, because the way I loved wasn’t the standard either. Advertisement  Over the years I’ve taken all kinds of women to bed, and while the urge to pick myself apart is still there, it’s quieter. Amanda wasn’t the last thin girl I slept with. And three years after an amicable split we actually got back together, as lesbians are wont to do.The first night together again in her dark bedroom, my familiar fears crept back. I still wondered if she could want a fat girl. But I pushed those worries aside.We’ve been back together for over a year now, and at 28, I’m the fattest and gayest I’ve ever been. The difference these days is when those thoughts come back, when I feel myself comparing our bodies, I forgive myself. For now, that’s enough.And this year, when I asked Amanda what I should wear for Pride, she’s the one who suggested a crop top. ●

453,"The instant, mundane moment you get vaccinated is actually one of the key moments of the century so far, and the celebration of this massive, intersecting community effort.","


Here was the scene at the Javits Center, one of this country’s mass vaccination sites, last Saturday: people walking snaking lines of constant motion through a giant glass warehouse in New York, producing the kind of ambient, enveloping hum of conversation that you never hear anymore because of the pandemic. At the very front of the line, when the last National Guard member directed people to numbered tables across the floor to receive their shots, he offered any couple their assignment and then: “Together forever!”Then, everyone got shots. We got stickers, we sat in black folding chairs spaced and faced in one direction, and, after a calm 15 minutes, we all got up and left. Advertisement  So there at this epic site constructed for the cheerful, industrial delivery of shots, the scene was still a little disparate, interior, and mostly silent, an individual experience done concurrently — no swell of community, no hot music. Many people have been a little muted or brief about celebrating their own vaccinations; there are a dozen deep and good reasons I can imagine for it, and first among them a hyper-awareness that each of us is so small a portion of the country that’s seen so many horrible deaths. And relief is hard to quantify. But for just a moment, I would like to dwell on the moment. It really is this weird thing to walk into a CVS or a high school cafeteria or what looks like an Avengers complex theme park ride likely by yourself, EXPERIENCE A TRANSFORMATIVE MOMENT of this century, sit in silence for 15 minutes, then likely leave by yourself, externally unchanged into the unchanged world.Four-point-six million people got vaccinated last Saturday in the United States. Forever, I will want to hear about you getting vaccinated: family, friends, total strangers, friends of strangers, those emergency nurses and doctors back in December and January, elderly musicians, someone’s beloved aunt. Let’s hear it. Imagine Pac-Man with the dots, but he’s chasing vaccine photos, and the decisive moment when someone’s life returns to them. Imagine little Super Mario chimes popping off every second across the entire United States — like that ca-ching, ca-ching, ca-ching — like one of those maps where all the lights ping on, like old some telephone or airline ad where every city and town lights up.Sometimes it’s like I can’t even believe the pandemic has happened. And nothing comparatively bad has even happened to me during this time, except that I have been alive during the pandemic, which has transformed life into an abyss and infused society with an unbearable, sprawling grief that will snake far beyond it. So here we arrive at this instant, mundane act of receiving a shot in the face of the grim past and present. But it’s way more than that, obviously. In ten seconds, it’s the intersection of something deep in your heart that only you can know, with the literal interior transformation of developing protections against the virus, with the true interconnected nature of society — because we’re all really just little Lego pieces clicking into place in a giant fence around the virus. Advertisement  It’s WILD, in the very best unbelievable way, what the scientists and everyone’s been able to do in this year of all-enveloping darkness to invent these vaccines and produce them. Confetti, balloons, cherry blossoms and wisteria from trees, hot music from the 2000s, stars should fall on these people, forever.Start back at the beginning with the messenger RNA vaccines. The big driver in part of that research, Kati Karikó, left Communist Hungary with less than $2,000 sewn into a teddy bear and the big academic research apparatus — for years — didn’t go for her pitches for messenger RNA research, she had ideas that didn’t pan out and lost out professionally, until it all came together! “My dream was always that we develop something in the lab that helps people,” her research collaborator, Drew Weissman, said. “I’ve satisfied my life’s dream.” Decades ago Barney Graham, now at the NIH and behind one of the other big-gun developments that make these vaccines work, was trying to understand why a vaccine trial in the 1960s had gone so wrong — and heard all the time, Why are you bothering with coronaviruses? “Barney, it looks like it’s working.” That’s how he got the news about the earliest results!Then you’ve got this billionaire scientist couple in Germany at BioNTech riding bikes to and from the lab, pushing forward with an mRNA vaccine with Pfizer, and the Moderna executive who wept with his family when their research results came back. Then you’ve got all these people up in upstate New York and down in Auburn, Alabama, making vials with these giant machines that you can see in these beautiful photos, and the people in Kalamazoo and Wisconsin and all the other places running lines filling those vials with formulated vaccines, then the people putting the vials into boxes and freezing them. You've got the people who signed up for the vaccine trials last year. You’ve got the people delivering these things. You’ve got the pharmacists who got more vaccine out of the vials than anticipated. You’ve got the people actually giving us the shots. You’ve got the people knocking on doors to sign people up and flagging down cars so nothing gets lost. The cafeteria worker who told one of the researchers at Pfizer that making lunch for the team made him feel like part of the vaccine effort? He was! Advertisement  All of this so 4.6 million people in a single day can experience an instant shot, done and over, and look and seem the same but be different afterward, and all the little dots all over the map can come to life.This news can be complicated, and living in reality requires complication — that vaccines don’t bring people back, that the global pandemic will take a long time to end, that it’s going to be a challenging endeavor to persuade everyone to get these shots, that grim inequalities endure, that people may run out of time waiting, that in an environment where you couldn’t believe the last year how could you really ever feel confident about the future? But the complication and grief can concurrently deepen the good news of the vaccines, too. Even the issues being studied with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine underscore how enormous the achievements are, that the problems have been in such rare cases. If this double-edged dynamic were not so, getting vaccinated would be nothing — just a mundane obligation on some afternoon when you could otherwise be doing anything else, rather than something you see the words “I cried” attached to again and again on Instagram.The nature of the thing, though, is that it’s brief and anticlimactic to get a shot, and the joint protect-yourself, protect-others venture is invisible. Society remains limited in literal capacity by the pandemic, and celebration in practice might begin and end with that Instagram post. But millions of times a day in the United States now, that moment is actually grand and populated, with the billionaire scientists riding their bikes around outside and the weeping executives and cafeteria cooks and vial-factory team, with the champagne and mezcal flowing and flowers falling, as each person clicks into place to someday end the terrible thing that’s happened. ● Advertisement

The court hearing appeared to open with two attorneys and a cat ready to proceed until Judge Roy Ferguson pointed out the issue in a deadpan voice.""Mr. Ponton, I believe you have a filter turned on in the video settings,"" he said.One of the attorneys quickly grabbed his glasses to get a better look while the cat then started to animate, its eyes and mouth moving as Ponton tried to explain the odd situation.""I don't know how to remove it,"" Ponton said, as a virtual cat. ""I have my assistant here. She's trying to but, I'm prepared to go forward with it.""""I'm not a cat,"" he said, as the kitten made a piteous face, and another one of the attorneys looked up and smirked at the situation.""I can see that,"" Ferguson responded.Ponton, an attorney for Presidio County, told BuzzFeed News he'd logged on for the hearing from a secretary's computer.""When I logged in to Zoom for the hearing, to my great surprise I was a cat,"" he said.Like other attorneys around the country, Ponton has had to use Zoom and other videoconferencing apps more often for court hearings during the pandemic and has had his share of mishaps, like not being able to sign in or his witnesses having trouble logging on.He never showed up as a cat before, though.He was more than willing to go on for the hearing as a cat, he said, but he got some help before things got started.""The judge figured out how to take the filter off and remove it, and miraculously my less humorous, old guy image appeared during the hearing,"" he said.On Twitter, Ferguson posted a clip of the exchange and pointed out that, although hilarious, the virtual hiccup shows how attorneys and legal professionals are facing unexpected troubles as they make sure the legal process carries on during the pandemic. Advertisement     ""These fun moments are a by-product of the legal profession's dedication to ensuring that the justice system continues to function in these tough times,"" Ferguson tweeted. ""Everyone involved handled it with dignity, and the filtered lawyer showed incredible grace. True professionalism all around!""The ongoing pandemic has forced courts across the country to use videoconferencing as many in-person hearings have been canceled, and the switch to virtual courts has posed difficulties since the get-go.Last year, a judge wrote to Florida attorneys reminding them to put on a shirt and to not appear in virtual court hearings in bed or poolside.""These are not casual phone conversations,"" Judge Dennis Bailey rebuked attorneys back in April.Judge Ferguson on Tuesday also suggested to attorneys that if their child used their computer before they did, to maybe turn off the filters before appearing in court.Ponton said he was thankful that the other attorneys and the judge were able to keep their composure during the hearing. He's also fine that the hilarious video is now going viral online.""If the country can pause for a moment and chuckle at a computer snafu at my expense, I'm glad,"" he said. ""It's been a stressful time.""

455,"“While money can’t buy true and lasting happiness, it most certainly can still create moments of joy and it can ease a lot of suffering.”","


As vaccines get doled out and the risk of COVID-19 — at least in the US — begins to dwindle, many people are feeling something they have not experienced much of in over a year: joy.Between a virus that’s killed over half a million Americans, widespread unemployment, a nationwide reckoning with white supremacy, a caustic presidential election, and a deadly coup attempt on the Capitol, joy could be a hard thing to find during the pandemic. Many people, stuck inside their homes but fortunate enough to have some money to spend, tried to shop their way out of gloom, buying things to try to alleviate the tedium, even if just for a moment, even if somewhere deep down they didn't even feel like shopping. Advertisement  So how did money impact joy during the pandemic? BuzzFeed News asked readers and staff about the things they've bought during this dark time, and how it shaped their views on the age-old question: Can money actually buy happiness? We got responses from all around the US and other countries as well. For many people, the answer was a soft yes, even if it was insignificant and fleeting. As one person told me, “Money might not buy happiness, but it sure does buy the ability to ignore all of the things that might make people depressed.” Their submissions have been edited for length and clarity.
 


“I bought a framed ‘Mona Lisa’ replica back from a family member. I originally bought it for £15 in 2013 and then gave it to them when I moved to London. With minimal human interaction during the pandemic, Mona’s been great company in my apartment despite her eyes constantly following me around the room.“I’m still not convinced that money can buy absolute happiness, but being sat next to the ‘Mona Lisa,’ I can say I'm pretty content right now."" —James Frewin in the UK
 


“We decided to do our own composting. Yes, I’m getting enjoyment watching worms eat our garbage and then turn it into a new gardening resource. The pandemic has reminded me how to enjoy the simple things and that it doesn’t take a lot of money to find happiness once your basic needs are met.” —Janie Berry in San Mateo, California Advertisement  
 


“The Peloton is a vehicle for me to make my own joy. It’s a type of exercise that is not too intense on my joints but gets me sweaty and stronger, and that makes me feel happy and present in my body.“I have a secure job, extreme privilege, some savings, and have been deeply blessed to have made it through this pandemic so far in a relatively safe manner. That, more than the Peloton, more than anything material I could buy, does make me happy. Money, in my mind, cannot buy happiness, but it can buy a level of safety and security, which can create a level of calm — though I try to ungrip from seeing that as the only way to be calm or happy. That’s capitalism’s fault and/or purpose.” —Addy Baird, BuzzFeed News staff
 


“I bought a fucking black light. I don’t remember off-hand who makes it. It's just some shit I got from Amazon. Honestly, I was probably kind of drunk. (“Kind of.” Lol.) But there was this quote that was going around last year (I saw several versions of it being tweeted and it was also in a New York Times interview, but I don’t know where it originated) that the pandemic was a black light that revealed all these unseen things about America. Also, black lights are just kind of dope. I had an idea I might do something with it for Halloween, or, you know, at least impress my kids. I don’t think they’ve ever seen a black light. But then when it showed up, I just felt really dumb. I was too embarrassed to say anything about it to my family. So I stuck it up in the top of my closet, meaning to return it. Of course, that just made me forget about it until it was too late. So it’s still up there, hidden away.“I did make some solid purchases last year. After all the schools and playgrounds shut down, I bought some 4x4s and plywood and built my kids a fort in our tiny little backyard. It’s fucking rad. But mostly, when I tried to use commerce as some sort of balm to cure the pain of being frightened and lonely and depressed, I just wasted my money. What I really wanted was more human contact. Instead I have a black light.” —Mat Honan, BuzzFeed News staff
 


“I’ve been mostly staying home alone, especially since the fall/winter surge started, and as such I’ve been wearing a lot of T-shirts, flannel, and ratty jeans. I keep the blazer out in my home to serve as a symbol of the things I look forward to doing soon: going to a restaurant, seeing friends and family, etc. It remains to be seen if I ever actually wear it out of the house, but it’s lifted my spirits just having it around.” —Dan Wolfe in Philadelphia
 


“I bought a ‘build your own hurdy-gurdy’ kit that I saw advertised on Instagram. It was $90 and I livestreamed myself building it on Twitch. It took about five hours, and those five hours were some of the most peaceful I felt all last year. The hurdy-gurdy is very beautiful and I look at it every day. It sounds like shit, though.” —Whitney Reynolds in Brooklyn Advertisement  
 


“I felt like the pandemic and lockdown meant relinquishing control of everything: all the things I’d planned to see and do that year, all the lofty ambitions I had for a new job, all the space I thought I’d cover through travel. Instead, I was stuck in a new, smallish apartment with nothing but basics: a few cookbooks and a daily walk to the local grocery store to buy the staples. The Dutch oven in fact changed nothing, but it just allowed me to cook amazingly delicious food and feel like I could still be in charge of something good.“You don't need to look beyond the amount of layoffs during the last awful year to know that if you can afford to buy a Dutch oven during the pandemic, you’re damn lucky.” —Astha Rajvanshi in New Delhi Advertisement  
 


“I bought a DDR mat because I used to be addicted to it in middle school and figured I could return to a simpler time, get a workout, and play a game all at once. It brought me great joy for a moment! But I used it literally one time, because I realized that while DDR is fun for me, it is not fun for my downstairs neighbors. It has been stuffed in a drawer ever since.“The pandemic has really made it clear who of my friends is living paycheck to paycheck, and who has family money to fall back on. The people who moved to their parents’ second homes don’t seem to be any happier than people like me who didn’t have the privilege of leaving the city, which leads me to believe money cannot buy happiness.” —Maggie Schultz, BuzzFeed News staff
 


“It’s a purse that looks like a chicken and I love her so much. Money can buy stability which leads to a significant impact on happiness — I was definitely happier after each stimmy.” —Camryn Kessler in Hartford, Connecticut
 


“I recently ordered a Kids’ Choice Award blimp off Etsy for $50. I bought it because I know I will be so happy when I open the package and see it in its orange glory. The mere prospect has me laughing.“I went from making less than $9,000 a year as a student working retail to making six figures at a very secure job as a lawyer. I would say I’m roughly 10,000,000 times less stressed about literally everything in my life. I have health insurance and I can afford to use it, I don’t have to put bills on credit cards, and I no longer get panic attacks thinking about how I’m going to afford groceries. I definitely think money can buy happiness in that it can buy security and peace of mind — and Kids’ Choice Awards.” —Emily Dowdle in Lincoln, Nebraska Advertisement  
 


“Honestly, it’s going to have to be the squirrel ladders. Plural. Because it’s not a squirrel obstacle course with only one ladder. And the little fuckers are maddeningly uncooperative. But I now fully qualify as an urban-nature-nerd, and yes — it has given me a small measure of happiness.“Money can buy you the illusion of safety. And in some cases safety. Which alleviates anxiety, which shouldn't be confused with happiness. Maybe we just get to set that happiness bar a little lower right now.” —Miranda Diakiw in Calgary, Alberta Advertisement  
 


“I bought this old, used desktop PC for $80 on eBay. It’s the kind of enormous, heavy computer you might find behind the desk of the DMV in 2015 because it’s cheap as hell and easy to repair. During lockdown I was playing a lot of computer games with friends, and one of them told me he would give him his old GPU if I bought a gaming PC to go around it. I am very cheap so I put it in this bottom-of-the-shelf used clunker. In any case, I use it all the time, and it's kind of a POS, but it was fun to work on something dumb while my industry and the world were collapsing around me.“I don't know if it influenced my thoughts on money and happiness, but I did feel a charge of terror with every eBay purchase I made. This was May and I had no idea if I was going to have a job in a month or two and imagined future-me kicking myself for buying this dumb PC while I struggle to pay rent. Spending as little as possible on it felt like a deal I was making with future-me.” —Scott Pham, BuzzFeed News staff Advertisement     
 


“A trashbag–sized bulk order of Soy Curls, a shelf-stable dehydrated vegan protein that has the texture of chicken when cooked. It was a practical way to ensure I had protein when I was grocery shopping so infrequently. It felt abundant! And offered some feeling of (food) security in a chaotic time. Money can provide security and safety, which lay a foundation for happiness.” —Jaime Karpovich in Frenchtown, New Jersey
 


“A Steve Kornacki mug that says ‘Map Daddy.’ It brings me joy every morning when I sip my coffee. I think the pandemic has changed my perspective on not feeling guilty for spending money on yourself if it makes you feel good. #TreatYoSelf” —Victoria Park in New York
 


“As promising news of the first vaccines started to come out, I bought metallic gold (vegan) snakeskin pants as a response to months of working in sweatpants. They were $200 and I had no idea where I would wear them. But I was so excited about the idea of people gathering in person again that I was undeterred by the ridiculousness of these pants. Money can’t buy happiness, but it can, occasionally, be used to buy silly pants.” —Melissa Nightingale in Toronto, Ontario Advertisement     
 


“I enjoy the hell out of these pencils, which I got for like $6. The lead does wear down faster than some other pencils, and they have subtly changed the design to a more gold finish in matte (versus the previous glossy yellow), and removed some of the nice detailing. But you can't beat the emphatic darkness of the lead, and just the pleasant friction of writing on paper with these things. They also have a good eraser.“I don’t think that buying things can totally solve deep, underlying, non-material problems one might have, but there are at least two kinds of purchases I’ll always find real satisfaction in: the impulse decisive expenditure in an exhausting situation (the later flight, paying extra for a nice hotel that one night), and the minor delights, like these pencils.” —Katherine Miller, BuzzFeed News staff Advertisement     
 


“I donated to some charities because I felt helpless. It brought a very temporary sense of meaning to my life.“I can’t buy products, even consumable ones, without feeling guilty about my environmental impact and/or supporting greedy corporations. Felt this way before the pandemic, and seeing how much crap people started getting delivered to their homes during the pandemic only made this worse.” —Nikita Dawe in Toronto, Ontario
 


“I bought it because I wanted to take the horse I have rehabilitated out to competitions and rides through the woods. Of course just after it was built and delivered, everything shut down, so I can count the number of times my horse has actually been in it on one hand. But it’s ready and waiting when things begin to get going again!“I worked two jobs throughout the pandemic, because horses always need looking after. I earned a good amount of money and because I wasn’t spending it on things like socializing and going out, I either saved it or spent it on my horses. And it makes me pretty dang happy when I can ride around the local village in a satin saddle pad and diamanté jodhpurs.” —Chloe Price in Ipswich, UK
 


“I’ve bought 26 romance novels since Christmas (my desire to know what happens next on Bridgerton sparked this). Romance novels have proven to be addictive and a delightful emotional escape from the pandemic for me.“Losing my job because I caught COVID-19 has made me realize the importance of money to giving you peace of mind.” —Whitney Louderback in Lone Tree, Colorado
 


“My best pandemic purchase was hands down a red plastic sled from Amazon that I ordered for $30. When a snowstorm hit NYC, I started a group chat, got friends to come out to Fort Greene Park and was like, ‘Tonight we RIDE, friends!’ Advertisement     “After a year of mostly staying inside being careful and months of cold weather, it was a cheap and incredibly fun adrenaline rush, as well as a safe way to see friends again.” —Rosalind Adams, BuzzFeed News staff
 


“Nothing feels as good as having fresh nails you did yourself without any distraction because your kid is too busy playing with dinosaurs toys. So yeah, money can buy a small piece of happiness, it doesn’t have to be a yacht.” —Kellie Gleeson in Pennsylvania
 


“A portable personal bathtub so I could visit my friends’ backyard and drink froséritas with them while they sat in their socially distanced baby pool. It brought me the happiness equivalent to the heat of 10,000 Texas summers, and I would 100% buy it again. Money can’t buy happiness, but it can buy you a portable personal bathtub. It’s up to you to assemble it, fill it with water of life, and make those happy memories.” —Lindsay McKenna in Austin
 


“I bought a multicolor sword, which came with two small daggers! On a purely aesthetic level, it’s gorgeous. It also makes me feel cool and interesting, and, on a few occasions, it even helped me feel safer in a new neighborhood! Advertisement     “I’ve always loved buying things for people. I don’t have a lot of money, living on a grad student budget, but gifts are my love language and I love finding things people will love and sharing it with them. During the pandemic I noticed I’ve been doing a lot more ‘retail therapy’ and it occurred to me — this is self-love. I’m getting gifts for myself in the same way I buy for friends and family.” —Colleen Etman in Columbia, South Carolina
 


“I bought a tangerine KitchenAid for $310. A bright orange machine that is the centerpiece of my kitchen. They’re pretty rare, and I had an eBay alert set up for months before I was able to snag one for a somewhat reasonable price. According to an Instagram story poll, it’s ‘a bit much.’ I love it. Advertisement     “I got my first real adult salaried job during the pandemic. So I am very privileged to be decently employed. The best part of having money is being able to buy good and healthy food. But after a while, the only thing each payday means is that some digits in my checking account change.” —Jack McGrath in Charlotte
 


“My favorite thing I bought was an original Andy Warhol photograph he took of a model. Once I had the thought that (thankfully) my savings could afford me to buy one of his pieces and still remain financially above water, I couldn’t stop thinking about it for like two weeks. Contacted an art dealer and communicated with him for a week before sealing the deal. Big picture it was a fairly impulsive decision, because I also was going through some personal drama, but I can guarantee it is something I will never regret buying.“The pandemic, most unfortunately, has affirmed my viewpoint that while money can’t buy true and lasting happiness, it most certainly can still create moments of joy and it can ease a lot of suffering.” —Alex W. in Clinton Township, Michigan Advertisement     
 


“I bought these realistic rubber fish slippers on Amazon. They do make me happy — they are funny to look at and they make an obnoxious slapping sound every time I walk across the floor. They are actually also surprisingly comfortable.“I’m not sure if money can buy you happiness, but it can buy you blissful unawareness. I am a university student and a grocery store worker. I have not seen my friends since last year when we all decided to scramble home. I live in a university town that generally attracts privileged kids. Watching them go back and forth from their hometown with ease, watching influencers and affluent people travel to warm places during the winter, watching poorer communities and public retirement homes suffer in a way that affluent communities do not, it is easy to tell that not everyone had the same pandemic. Money might not buy happiness, but it sure does buy the ability to ignore all of the things that might make people depressed.” —Jemma Taio Dooreleyers in Kingston, OntarioThis story is part of the BuzzFeed News Money Week series that looks at how the pandemic changed the ways we earn, owe, spend, and save money.

456,"Hi here's 3,000 words on why Chris Pratt does or doesn't suck. Feel free to add more.","


Estelle Tang: Everyone is discussing Chris Pratt on the internet. He made an Instagram post that caused consternation. He was recently cast as both Mario and Garfield. He is living and breathing, which it seems is enough to cause pique for some folks. What’s your take, BuzzFeed culture desk?Scaachi Koul: OK, let’s talk about the worst of all the Chrises in all the land.Elamin Abdelmahmoud: Hello, I am here to say that Chris Pratt may not be the best Chris, but in no way, shape, or form is he the worst Chris. For god’s sake, are you people forgetting Thor 2? In fact, all Chris Pratt does is give us stuff to talk about, and for this, I am grateful. Advertisement  SK: Very troubling that you think someone merely being at the center of a discourse means they are not actively bad.Stephanie McNeal: I’m fascinated by his fall from grace. Just a few short years ago, he was arguably the number one Chris in this group. People loved him on Parks and Recreation, and when he made the jump into big blockbusters they really cheered him on. Now, he’s reviled. What happened?EA: Not to jump right in, but I wonder if people actually dislike him or if that is just true in certain extremely online liberal corners of the internet, when in fact he’s out here carrying whole movie franchises on his shoulders. Guardians? Check! Jurassic World? Check! He’s been cast as Mario in the Mario movie (which is unhinged, but sure). He’s Garfield in the Garfield movie. Chris Pratt is…beloved at the box office. In fact, he’s one of the most bankable actors of all time.SK: Remember when he was on Everwood, that WB show about a single dad moving to a small town, where Pratt is some B-plot character and his name on the show was...Bright????? That was a good show. Justice for Everwood, but not for Chris Pratt, with whom I am having a negative parasocial relationship with. He just feels like someone I knew, at some point in my life, whom I absolutely do not care for. He’s just everywhere, and I am increasingly unsure if I want him to be anywhere at all. Advertisement  EA: Wait, I forgot the Lego Movie!!!! That movie hits.ET: Well, he’s way more famous now than he was when we first started talking about the Chrises. Mid-2010s profiles of him are like, “Look at this doofus from Parks and Recreation suddenly being in all these MOVIES.” Now he’s arguably the most high-profile Chris, so people are analyzing his behavior way more, and also, expectations are higher; his off-the-cuff blue humor of yesteryear (apparently he surprised Amy Poehler by appearing naked in one Parks and Recreation scene and made a rude joke about Kim Kardashian in another), which might have seemed charmingly outré when he was a regular-Chris-made-good, wouldn’t fly today.EA: I mean, I think we take it for granted that he’s more famous than he was, and forget how hard it is for someone to be this good at these blockbuster movies. His job is to sell the corniest dialogue, and truly, not everyone can do that! The compost bins of Hollywood are filled with folks who simply could not make the leap from massive TV success to massive movie success. For instance: Jon Hamm, where you at??? Taylor Kitsch, RIP. Chris Pratt got big because he is good at the thing he does, which is having mass appeal, and I’m not sure he’s ever pretended to be anything else. Advertisement  SK: Please leave Jon Hamm out of this. He’s doing great work on Curb Your Enthusiasm and that’s enough for me.
 


ET: I’m interested in the role his social media has played in the latest backlash — this week’s post wishing his wife Katherine Schwarzenegger a happy birthday resulted in plenty of negative attention. “She’s given me an amazing life, a gorgeous healthy daughter,” he wrote. “She helps me with everything. In return, periodically, I open a jar of pickles. That’s the trade. Her heart is pure and it belongs to me.” Some people thought his “healthy daughter” comment was insensitive, given that his son with Anna Faris, Jack, has had health issues. Others thought that the line “Her heart is pure and it belongs to me” smacked of Old Testament possessiveness and traditional ideas of how a woman is supposed to act. Advertisement  SM: I am of the belief that the change in public perception is entirely a result of his online presence. Ever since his divorce from Anna Faris and subsequent remarriage to Katherine, his Instagram has gotten weird: a lot of strange commentary about her devotion to him and not one but MULTIPLE photos of her giving him a pedicure. People tend to interpret his posts about Katherine as being self-serving and question the dynamics of their relationship. This latest post is just the culmination of a few years of content that the internet thinks is cringe. Their engagement post got made fun of for being stilted. IDK, the criticism is maybe too harsh, but it’s been going on for a while.SK: It is really a case where if he just kept his mouth shut online, people would not dislike him so much. Like, who would have been thinking about Chris Pratt if he hadn’t posted something truly bizarre about how much his wife loves him? Staying quiet is a skill and a lesson for us all!EA: Honestly, my read on the recent post was not anything evil or sinister like some folks think, but just that this guy does not have the facility with words — he can get away with that kind of sarcasm in a video format, where you can see in his face that he’s just playing dumb, but in words, it looks dark as hell. Advertisement  SK: The fact that people don’t want to give him the benefit of the doubt is telling. If, say, Dax Shepard made the same post, I doubt people would so immediately consider him a figure of patriarchal anglo-Christian Republican agitprop. But Shepard and Kristen Bell have a very different public-facing relationship, and different public personas for people to cling to. Pratt, it seems, is not someone people want to laugh with anymore.EA: I think you’re trying to get at the infamous giant cross Instagram post, yeah? I mean, look, no one has a good explanation for that. Maybe when you’re rich, you just buy bigger crosses.SK: Looking forward to my future, then.ET: All of the other Chrises do a pretty good job of being, if not openly progressive, then at least quiet enough for people to project any values whatsoever onto them. In contrast, Pratt is very openly Christian, with strong family values, as they say, which makes him an easy target for people who don’t agree with him. What part does that have to play in how he’s received/seen?SM: In 2015, when he was at peak likability, there was a profile of him in GQ where he definitely had…how can I say this…conservative energy? To be clear, it didn’t talk about his politics, but it made him out to be a “salt of the earth,” hunting-and-fishing kind of guy. I wonder if some people began to question his values after that, and in the Trump era, looked at him more critically. But even though some people accuse him online of being a Trump supporter, there’s very little evidence he’s actually MAGA. I do think wearing a “Don’t Tread on Me” shirt shows a bit about his views, though. Advertisement  
 


EA: I’ve been wondering about his religiosity in the context of another man of God and fellow Hillsong Church member, Justin Bieber. Bieber is very publicly religious, he’s just as much of a wife guy, but it comes off differently with the Biebs. Is there something that Pratt does differently than Bieber? Because on the face of it, a celebrity being very religious and famous is quirky in this moment — I think it has become a lazy shorthand for conservatism, which for some people has become a lazy shorthand for being homophobic or racist, which is entirely unfair — but it wasn’t that long ago that it was quite common! Advertisement  SK: I wonder if some of the negative response is a result of people feeling bait-and-switched. He was this sweet, dopey, cutesy actor who then loses a lot of weight, divorces his wife, remarries, and starts referencing Christianity (and, as you say, Steph, conservative energy) way more openly on his Instagram. I think maybe some fans felt like there was a pivot somewhere. Like, was he like this all along? Who knows. The point is this is who he is now.SM: Exactly. I think the Parks and Rec heads felt a sense of betrayal. The show had a very liberal bent to its story and messages. It's safe to assume many die-hard fans identified with the show’s values, so when Chris, the breakout star of the show, started to express values that were different from that, I think some of them were upset.ET: Is that the main inflection point where he lost some of his audience? He’s had detractors for a little while, perhaps inescapable when you’re that well known. Were there other pivotal moments? What about the Mario casting, for god’s sake? Advertisement  SK: Mammmmma mia!EA: JFC. Listen, as far as I can tell, he began to lose a certain portion of the very online audience when he and Anna Faris divorced. They were beloved as a couple, and their public relationship was sweet and playful. When they started being a thing, people were rooting for him because she was way more famous and way hotter than him. Or am I misremembering this?SM: Yes, I think the breakup with Anna and the relationship with Katherine really changed people’s opinion of him. This is no shade to Katherine (I follow her on Instagram!), but people LOVED him and Anna together. When he then went for someone who was very different from Anna, and also much younger, he also seemed to change his public image. Some of his social media posts about Katherine and ways he has spoken about her in the press also read kind of off, like he was infantilizing her or not respecting her. Also, I think there was this sense Anna had been there since the beginning, they had been through so much together, and then as soon as he got big he dumped her.ET: It reminds me of how people responded to John Mulaney’s relationship with Olivia Munn; people judge men harshly for seeming to slight their ex-wives. Advertisement  Pratt is also someone whose body has changed quite a lot in a very public way; he’s talked about it in interviews. How do you think that plays into how he’s being perceived?EA: People like a schlubby man, bruv. But he got jacked and was still funny. And that doesn’t happen often. We got to know his brand of goofball humor when he was schlubby Andy, but — we all know this — hot people are not funny. So when he got ripped, a lot of people weren’t ready for how he could be hot and funny at the same time. Like when people saw him in Guardians, it was so charming, I still remember the theater exploding in laughter at that opening sequence, where he’s dancing to “Come and Get Your Love” and holding a lizard-looking thing and singing and killing stuff. He was so chrismatic.SK: Did you mean to write charismatic as “chrismatic?” If so, you will be hearing from my lawyer.EA: This was a typo and it will now stand. Send your little legal notices.SM: I actually don’t think his body changes impacted his likability that much because as I recall, people were loving when he got jacked, like what we just saw with Kumail Nanjiani. It was how he seemed to change the rest of his life (divorcing Anna, mainly, and being more open about his faith) that some of his fans were turned off by. Advertisement  SK: I don’t know if it’s that his physical change heralded a spiritual or intellectual change or whether we just started to pay more attention to his personal life. Ultimately, it’s the red state vibes he’s started to give off in the last few years, combined with this kind of aggressive can-do attitude that always pisses me off. Take, for example, his response to the latest backlash: There’s something really out of touch about a very rich, very famous person lecturing the average person about how they just need to get out there and get their workout in and go for a run listening to your Christian rock playlist. He’s so distant from the realities of his audience that I think it’s playing a role in the way some people resent him.
 


ET: What do we think Chris Pratt is good at? What is his appeal?SK: Tall? White? Loves protein, probably? He does have a kind of precious impishness that I did indeed find adorable a few years ago, and now I’m out here googling “Parks and Rec episodes without Chris Pratt.” I liked Guardians of the Galaxy too! I thought it was a perfectly pleasant Marvel movie, he made me laugh, I was open to accepting his large muscles. I think his failure is in his attempts to humanize himself to an audience that doesn’t find him personally charming. Advertisement     EA: I think he’s a good utility player in a movie. He's very good at having chemistry with nearly everyone you put next to him onscreen. He makes Dave Bautista look good. He makes CGI baby dinosaurs look good! That’s why he keeps being cast in these ensemble projects. But remember Passengers? Where he had to be onscreen alone for like an hour? We learned quickly that he is no Tom Hanks. He doesn’t have the arresting presence that can carry a movie alone — but he’s a good conductor of energy, meaning he can be the fixation point when there’s varying quality of actors on the screen, and transform that movie into a hit. He can be the tall white guy in the center of the poster at the movie theater, and folks will say, ""Sure, here’s 15 bucks.""ET: Has the basis for his likability changed over the past decade or so?EA: No! He’s always been kind of a goofball, always been a little bit basic, can make you laugh, and he still does exactly those things! I am sorry to say I love a good Pratt. He commanded those pesky lil’ baby dinosaurs real well in Jurassic World. It’s not a movie that asks a lot of you, and nor does Chris Pratt. But we found out things like how he listens to Joe Rogan, and that hit different with some folks. But in terms of the stuff he does onscreen, I really think he does exactly the same stuff. That’s almost a better reason to dislike him, if you must: He hasn’t evolved a lot! Advertisement     SK: I think it’s changed! Or at least, I think his likability within a certain kind of audience has changed. Like, think about Parks and Rec, which is a pretty clearly liberal show. I do not know if the Chris Pratt of today would be on that show, and as such, the people who loved Andy Dwyer are unlikely to love Chris Pratt: Noted Large Cross Possessor.EA: That’s interesting, I hadn’t thought of how he might’ve benefited from the “halo effect” of being on an explicitly liberal show. You know what, Mark Ruffalo still vouches for him.SK: Mark Ruffalo is a 9/11 truther, Elamin. You can’t have anything nice in this world.ET: How is it that Pratt has managed to bounce back after some of these so-called missteps?SK: Well, it’s not like he’s done anything particularly monstrous. To my knowledge (someone correct me if I’m wrong), he hasn’t been accused of abuse or assault or harassment or overt racism. It is simply that the Vibes Are Off, which isn’t really something to recover from — it’s just something for his audience to either accept or disengage with. Will I watch him as Mario? Yes. Will I enjoy it? I will not. Advertisement     EA: I do want to flag that Elliot Page called out Pratt for attending Hillsong over alleged homophobia, and Chris Pratt was like, “No, my church is not homophobic!” And that gave the impression that he is a Church Guy, but that is only a crime on the Cool People’s Internet.SK: See? The vibes are off! And the vibes are made worse by him insisting, absolutely insisting, upon talking when he does not need to do so.SM: I think that’s a critical note. There’s not a ton of stuff he has DONE; people just think he has bad energy. The reasons why people disliked him were very opaque, until the recent IG post, which I think is why so many people jumped on it.ET: What proportion of this mini-backlash is simply the idea of overexposure, given the recent Garfield and Mario castings and his various existing franchises? Is he actually more overexposed than the other Chrises? Advertisement     EA: A friend of mine made the comparison that Chris Pratt is hated for the same reasons that James Corden is hated, which is that these folks are ubiquitous as hell. That checks out, in that some folks are not sure what the problem is, just that there is one. But no one knows what it is!SK: It’s very hard being a straight white man of a certain age. Joe Rogan taught me that.EA: I want to throw out one more thing working against Chris Pratt, which is that time his Avengers costars came to his defense and were all “he’s a pretty good Chris, actually.” It was fine, friends do that for each other, but it was particularly bad in light of the fact that they did not come to Brie Larson’s defense when she was getting sexist criticism. They basically said nothing.SK: You know who’s great? Me. They should let me be the next good Chris.EA: I think there’s something to what Scaachi said earlier: an inverse relationship between the amount a Chris talks and how great they are. This is why Chris Meloni reigns above all. Followed closely by Chris Noth. Rank the Chrises who do their job then shut the hell up.SK: SUN IN CHRIS MELONI. ASCENDANT IN CHRIS PINE. MOON IN KRIS JENNER.EA: Justice for Mintz-Plasse.SM: Knowing what I know about America, I predict Maria Shriver’s grand plan will work and he will be our president in a decade. ● Advertisement

457,Updating charts for our climate crisis.,"


In a world regularly hit by supercharged storms, surging seas, deadly heat waves, and intense wildfires, the climate crisis is already a clear and present danger.The numbers below document global warming and sea level rise since the 1880s, when widespread reliable data became available. They show just how far we have already come — and how little wiggle room we have to avoid a climate catastrophe by the end of this century. Advertisement  Under the 2015 Paris agreement, the world’s nations agreed to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial temperatures — ideally restricting warming to just 1.5 degrees C (2.7 Fahrenheit).Less than a decade later, we’re close to blowing past the 1.5-degree target, having so far made little progress in turning things around.
 


The range shown for global warming comes from comparing the average global temperature for the period of 1880–1899 with the average for the most recent five complete years, as measured by two leading studies of historical temperature records that are run by NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Berkeley Earth.The Berkeley Earth project launched in 2010 — funded in part by the conservative-leaning Charles Koch Foundation — to address concerns that observed global warming might result from biases in data collection. But its reanalysis conclusively confirmed the scientific consensus that our planet is heating up. Indeed, the higher 1.3 degrees estimate comes from Berkeley Earth; 1.2 degrees is from NASA’s analysis.“We already have dangerous climate change,” Michael Wehner, a senior staff scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, told BuzzFeed News. “It’s just more dangerous for every tenth of a degree.”As the Earth has warmed, the global average sea level has risen, driven by melting ice and the thermal expansion of seawater. The estimate for sea level rise since 1880 comes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It is based on analyses of historical records from tide gauges throughout the world combined in recent decades with measurements of the return time and intensity of radar pulses fired down at the ocean surface from orbiting satellites. Advertisement  
 


This chart plots the monthly global average temperature calculated by NASA and Berkeley Earth — you can highlight either analysis by tapping or hovering on the legend item. While there is a lot of variation from month to month, there’s a clear warming trend, especially in recent decades. Both projects calculate global temperatures compared to the average from 1951 to 1980, a relatively stable period during which temperature monitoring stations had good coverage across most of the globe.
 


Not everywhere is heating up at the same speed. Change has been most rapid in the Arctic, which is warming at three times the global rate and causing a decline in Arctic sea ice and melting the Greenland ice sheet. Warming has also been faster over land than over the ocean. You can use this map to view NASA’s historical temperature analysis for any location shown: Click or tap on the map or enter a location into the search box to see the annual chart redraw for that location.
 


This chart of average global sea level combines data from two projects: a reconstruction using historical and modern records, which runs from 1880 through 2013, from scientists with CSIRO, Australia’s national research agency, and an ongoing project at the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center. The reference for comparison is the global average sea level from 1993 to 2008, after satellite measurements came into regular use. Since 2006, global average sea level has been rising by about 3.6 millimeters (0.14 inches) per year, according to NOAA. Advertisement  Even if coastal areas are not completely inundated, rising sea levels make it more likely that unusually high tides or surges caused by powerful storms will trigger flooding, causing major property damage and loss of life.If we don’t limit warming, sea level rise is expected to accelerate as more and more ice melts from Antarctica’s massive ice sheets. According to a recent study published in the journal Nature, a trajectory that sends the planet toward 3 degrees C of warming could cause an abrupt increase in the pace of Antarctic ice melting after 2060. Compared to a world warmed by 2 degrees C, this would cause an extra 6 centimeters (2.4 inches) of sea level rise by the end of this century and an extra 23 centimeters (9 inches) by the end of the next.“These results demonstrate the possibility that rapid and unstoppable sea-level rise from Antarctica will be triggered if Paris Agreement targets are exceeded,” the researchers concluded. Advertisement  That would reshape coastlines worldwide, devastating cities from Amsterdam to Bangkok and triggering massive human migration. It would also wipe some small island nations off the map. And these projections do not include an unpredictable yet catastrophic tipping point like a rapid collapse of one of Antarctica’s enormous ice sheets — an almost unimaginable event that could add several meters to the global average sea level.
 


Warming and sea level rise are driven by the buildup in the atmosphere of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. These gases act like a glasshouse, trapping the sun’s heat and warming the globe.Since 1958, we have had accurate measurements of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from a project started by the late Charles David Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He used infrared sensors to measure the concentration of the gas in air at the Mauna Loa Observatory on the Big Island of Hawaii, a site chosen for its lack of local pollution and sparse vegetation (plants pull carbon dioxide from the air). Advertisement  The chart above shows records from both Mauna Loa and a composite value compiled by NOAA from measurements at sites across the globe since 1980. Both plots show a regular annual cycle with a dip each spring and summer caused by the plant growing season in the large landmasses of the Northern Hemisphere superimposed over a climb caused mostly by fossil fuel burning.
 


Deniers of human-caused climate change sometimes argue that levels of carbon dioxide and global temperatures have varied widely in the past as a consequence of natural long-term cycles — and suggest that something similar is happening today. They are wrong, and scientists have proof of this. Advertisement  By measuring levels of carbon dioxide trapped in bubbles of air in deep cores taken from the thick cap of Antarctic ice, scientists have been able to reconstruct the atmospheric concentration of the gas going back more than 800,000 years. It’s true that levels of carbon dioxide waxed and waned as the Earth cycled in and out of successive ice ages. However, the final almost vertical line, which includes the modern record shown on the previous chart, shows that nothing like the recent surge has happened in the ice-core record. Humanity’s emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels are clearly to blame, scientists concluded in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.
 


This chart ranks the world’s nations by their contribution to those emissions, using data compiled by Our World in Data from the Global Carbon Project. Once released into the atmosphere, carbon dioxide can hang around for hundreds of years. This means that the Earth today is being warmed by the cumulative emissions pumped out over many decades — making the United States, the largest historical emitter, most responsible for the crisis, even though China’s current annual emissions are larger. Advertisement  The long residence time of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere also means that global warming is a bit like an oil tanker on the high seas: slow to turn around, even if you yank hard on the tiller. The great challenge now facing humanity is that we need to make rapid cuts in our use of fossil fuels. The goal is to quickly bring our emissions down to what’s called “net zero” — where carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere equals the amount being pulled out by natural or technical means — to have any chance of keeping beneath those 2015 Paris targets.
 


But as this chart shows, at least until the temporary reduction caused in 2020 by the coronavirus pandemic, carbon dioxide emissions have grown, driven in particular by a surge in emissions from Asia in recent decades as China and India flexed their economic muscles. Advertisement  It is still not too late to turn things around. But if we don’t quickly cut the mountain of carbon dioxide emissions shown on the chart above, a disastrous future awaits.
 


This chart shows potential future emissions scenarios, released by the Climate Action Tracker during the 2021 climate summit in Glasgow. Emissions over the past three decades are shown as a black line. (The numbers are larger than on the previous chart because they account for all greenhouse gases, not just carbon dioxide.)According to these projections, current policies will likely see the world warm to up to 2.9 degrees C above preindustrial temperatures. The most ambitious targets to reduce emissions might just keep warming down 1.8 degrees C, but these depend on pledges from some nations to achieve net-zero emissions in the future that give few details on how they will actually be achieved. Advertisement     A big problem with these targets is that deep cuts do not begin immediately. And it is far from clear whether pledges will actually be met; according to an investigation by the Washington Post, many nations are not even reporting their current emissions accurately.“It’s all very well for leaders and governments to claim they have a net-zero target but if they don’t have plans on how to get there — their 2030 targets are not aligned with net zero — then frankly these net-zero targets are just paying lip service to real climate action,” Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics, one of the partners behind the projections, said at a press conference.“One thing is clear: All governments need to reconsider their targets so that we can keep 1.5 degrees alive,” added Claire Stockwell, a senior climate policy analyst with Climate Analytics.

458,"“It’s amazing people want to kill me over paving roads and clean water,” Garbarino told BuzzFeed News.","


WASHINGTON — A recent vote for President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill has developed into a controversial, life-threatening exercise for Rep. Andrew Garbarino, a New York Republican who broke with his party to support the legislation.Staff at Garbarino’s offices have been flooded with threats targeting the Congress member following the vote, including ""one specific death threat and numerous other instances of harassment both over the phone and in person at our offices,"" spokesperson Kristen Cianci told BuzzFeed News. Local authorities have also spoken to the Garbarino about increased patrols near his district office. Advertisement     Nassau Police confirmed that Kenneth Gasper was arrested and charged with aggravated harassment for a death threat he made to Garbarino, according to Detective Lt. Richard LeBrun.“It’s amazing people want to kill me over paving roads and clean water,” Garbarino told BuzzFeed News. “The misinformation out there about this bill is so bad that I’m getting death threats.”Garbarino is one of 13 House Republicans whose office phone numbers were publicized by their Republican colleague Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene after they helped pass the $1.2 trillion bill. Since the vote, those members and their staff have faced an increasing amount of harassment.The targeted harassment of Republicans who voted for the bipartisan bill is the latest example of the tension between Republican members who break away from the party and their base. Former president Donald Trump has also singled out those members, saying soon after the infrastructure bill passed last week that Republicans who voted for it should be ""ashamed of themselves"" and were not real Republicans. Advertisement     Garbarino faced a barrage of negative comments on a recent Facebook post explaining why he voted for the bill. Even though he began his post by condemning a separate bill that contains a majority of Democrats’ social spending priorities, most of the nearly 500 responses were unforgiving, with users vowing to “remember next year” and “vote Garbarino Out!”“I seriously hope you aren’t entertaining the possibility of running again as a Republican,” one Facebook user posted on Garbarino’s profile. “Try running as a Dem/Socialist, you’ll have better luck GarbaRINO.”Garbarino said he hopes that during next week’s party conference, his colleagues, like Greene, are reminded that their actions are affecting other members.“I don’t think my colleagues want to get me killed, but they should stop with the rhetoric,” Garbarino said.

459,"""In the years I worked at a sex shop, I saw how the pressure to have great sex — in a world that will never be a level playing field — can inflict its own kind of damage.""","


I worked at a sex shop for seven years — one of those friendly, brightly lit storefronts that hired young feminists and queers with college degrees and great haircuts. Before hitting the sales floor, we were trained on the store’s core value: sex positivity. This philosophy encourages and celebrates the vastness of human sexual expression, without favoring any single activity, orientation, or kind of body as the best, the most valid, or the most sexy. Sex positivity posits that as long as the choices that are being made are consensual for all people involved, then it’s great, and that people should be respected and celebrated for making the choices that are best for them. I was hired as a 22-year-old, a recent college grad with a still-uncool haircut, and getting to work for a company that held this as a core belief felt really exciting.My job was to make sales, to make the store as much money as possible. That never bothered me. I knew that in order to keep offering the kind of programming we did, or to donate to the causes we did, we had to keep cash flowing in. It was also fun, at least some of the time. The excitement people felt buying their first-ever vibrator, a new lube, or a strap-on harness and dildo to use with a partner — that was contagious. But many of my customers were conditioned to believe that if they bought the right thing, they would suddenly have a hot sex life, or that they, alone, could do the heavy lifting for themselves and their partner. Advertisement  That was a common thread running through my next job at the same company, as a sex educator running workshops on specialized topics, that took me to universities, to medical schools, to bachelorette parties. Participants expressed the hope that if they could just learn to give a perfect blow job, or figure out the magic words to say to their partner, they would be transformed into liberated, all-powerful, multiorgasmic beings with perfect relationships. But it’s never been that simple. Navigating sex will always also be a question of navigating the biases and traumas and fears and power imbalances that we and our culture are riddled with. And in some cases, for some people, there is a dark side to unrelenting (sex) positivity. The pressure around sex to feel that you’re doing it right, despite all those complications — and having a great time doing it — can inflict its own kind of damage.
 


“What’s your best toy?” people would ask when I worked in the store, as if there were a single thing that would work for all people, all bodies, all proclivities. It was up to us to transform that conversation. (“There’s not really one best thing, but let’s find something that is going to be the best for you.”) Still, people wanted toys that would do the fucking for them, stimulate enough that they wouldn’t have to learn more about their partners’ bodies. People constantly asked for hands-free toys that they could “set and forget,” that they wouldn’t ever need to grip onto. And they asked for toys that were not “intimidating,” for them or for their partners. “Something great, please, but nothing that could replace me,” they would say, over and over again.
 


During my tenure doing sex toy retail, I saw thousands of people attempt to wallpaper over their discomfort by buying the “right” toy to solve their problems. People dropped hundreds of dollars trying to make their partners listen to them, or find them desirable, or care about their pleasure. That’s how afraid they were to communicate. But then, who could blame them? It was clear in some cases that the partner didn’t care, or didn’t want to listen, or that the customer would be punished for speaking up for themselves. My colleagues and I gently advised many people around relationships where they were disempowered, ignored, devalued, and dehumanized without language for it.We did not work on commission at the store, and that was deliberate; it was important to the sales staff that no one feel pressured to buy anything or spend more money than they wanted to. I decided not to make a sale at all a couple of times, when my manager was not present. I remember refusing to sell a man restraints because he wanted to “tie up [his] wife so that she can’t get away, even if she says she wants to be free.” Instead, we had a conversation about the importance of consent and the differences between nonconsent fantasies and actual assault. The conversation annoyed him; he walked out of the store in a huff. Once, a couple came into the store in the middle of an active fight, with the male partner telling the female partner what to buy, and the female partner refusing over and over again, in escalating voices, until he threw his credit card on the counter and she went silent. I rang them up, my skin crawling. Once, I quietly told a humiliated customer who had been brought into the store as a surprise that she could return the toy she had been bullied by a partner into buying, against our stated return policy.I remember talking to customers about how to break up with their partners, how to keep themselves safe. Within a couple of minutes of reassuring, sex-positive talk on the sales floor, customers disclosed abuse histories, or fantasies they were not brave enough to talk to anyone about, or doubts about being married. I felt care for my customers, people who had maybe never had a space to talk to another person about sex in a way that was affirming. It was special to me that they felt they could confide in me, that they could ask me intensely personal questions about their body, and that I would not judge them. But at the end of the day, we sold sex toys, not solutions.That said, there were many times when helping customers explore their desires was thrilling, moving, profound. One man who was getting his prostate removed because of a cancer diagnosis told me he wasn’t afraid of the surgery, but he was terrified that it would greatly reduce the volume of his ejaculate. He laughed. “I know it’s silly, but it makes me feel like less than a man!” And then he cried. I told him I didn’t think it was silly; I asked if I could put my hand on his shoulder, and we stood there for a moment together.
 


Once, a mother came into the store with her teenage son. They had come to the city for a transgender teen support group and to buy him a packer, an item worn in the front of pants to create the appearance of a bulge. The trip was expensive, she told me, but her son had saved his own money to buy the packer himself. He had his eye on the Cadillac of packers but didn’t have enough cash to buy the snug undies it was best worn with, with a secure front pocket for it to sit inside. I asked them how they felt about this offer: After six years of working at the store, I had hundreds of dollars in store credit and more sex toys than I would ever need. Would he consider buying the fancy packer he liked the most and letting me buy the packing underwear? His mother asked the question I wish we all asked more often — “Are you a hugger?” — and I came around the counter and embraced them both. Out of his earshot, she said, “Thank you for showing him that there are going to be places in the world that understand and accept him, because that’s not always true where we live,” and then I cried and she cried and then he cried, three weepers silhouetted in a sex toy storefront. My colleagues and I sold sex positivity through luxury merchandise; we stuffed intersectional, trauma-aware education in the bag as the gift with purchase.Matching the other person’s energy in a conversation is great for making sales in retail, and sometimes in counseling and therapeutic settings. So I matched. I matched the energy of the fiftysomething couple stocking up on toys to take overseas to an all-out sex club tour of Berlin. I matched the energy of the woman who was finally ready to masturbate again after a painful divorce. I matched the energy of a submissive buying a butt toy to use with his mistress, and an 80-year-old woman who had never had an orgasm before, and a fratty guy who didn’t want to buy lube because “he’ll get her wet enough.” When the store was packed, I would ping-pong between customers, adjusting my registers up and down, caring and convivial, helpful and empathic, and a real bargain at $12 an hour. Those interactions would end with the existential question of all retail, a question whose vastness lingered in the air as I rang up their purchases: Did you find what you were looking for?
 


“Consent is sexy!” is true, and it’s also a slogan that looks great on a tote bag. “The absence of consent is assault!” will not sell you as much merch. I wonder how many people think they know what consent really looks like, sounds like, feels like. (For the people who worry that talking about sex “kills the mystery”: The mystery is whether the other person is into what’s going on. I don’t solve mysteries with my genitals; I use my brain and my words for that.)I talked about consent in all of the sex education workshops I ran, and I would sometimes explain it this way, really throttling the metaphor to death: Let’s say you want to invite your friend to get dinner at a restaurant. Do you say “Do you want to have dinner?” and leave it at that? Or do you ask more questions: “Anything you’re particularly in the mood for? Are you allergic to certain foods? Is there anything new you want to try?” What if you got to the restaurant, and your friend said, “Okay, I know I said I was in the mood for this, but I actually feel like I want something else instead.” And what if you were eating, and then your friend was full and wanted to stop?I never added this, but I should have: What if your boss invited you out for dinner, not your friend? Would that change the way you answered? Would it be harder to tell them you weren’t interested in the restaurants they suggested? Does that power differential make it harder to say no, knowing that there could be consequences? Our culture has flattened this nuance when we talk about consent. Saying “no” is one thing (a very important thing), but what does it mean to face the potential of violence for your “no”? How will that change the quality of your “yes”? We are expected to ignore all of the ways we could be punished, or else learn to eat whatever is being served without complaint. Advertisement  
 


Because of this, the imperfect manifestation of sex positivity that many inadvertently practice can be a destructive tool. Oh, you’re not a kick-ass feminist sweetheart who GETS WHAT SHE WANTS in bed? Sorry, honey, I guess you’re hopeless! It is easier to distance ourselves from perceived failure than it is to be curious, to wonder: What makes it hard for someone to talk about sex, or be open about their boundaries, or assert their discomfort? Is it a history of trauma, or cultural conditioning, or something relational? Rather than attempting to understand, we may critique someone else’s terrible experience because we know we would be too cool to let it happen to us.This once again places the burden and the blame squarely on the victim. The assumption is that if you got hurt, it’s still your fault because you didn’t try hard enough to be the right kind of woman — as if empowered women don’t get hurt. I declined to call my first assault by its name at first, because being assaulted didn’t fit in with the image of myself I identified with. And the alternative, to accept that my inextricable tether to gender-based subjugation could not be overridden with force of will, was overwhelming and painful. If I accepted it, I had to let in a new critical voice, a new stomach through which to digest the cud of years of bad-faith negotiations with men. It would be easier not to. It would be easier to believe a $100 vibrator could meet a need I could not give voice to.During my time at the sex shop, dozens of men came in with their wives and girlfriends and asked for a product that would “turn her on” or “make her enjoy sex more.” We sold something called arousal balm, which I described as a tingly lip balm for your downstairs bits. But it couldn’t manufacture arousal itself, I would explain, as arousal was a function of the brain, and certainly did not start or end with the application of topical cream to the genitals. Maybe, I would gently suggest, this is a good time to have a conversation where she tells you what her fantasies are, what kinds of sex she enjoys, how she likes to be touched. Customers would frown, and I would ring them up for their $10 alternative to communicating.We are still holding on to the antiquated, bizarre idea that straight women don’t like sex. I try to imagine serving someone a bowl full of flour, and when they don’t eat it, throwing up my hands and saying, “I’ve tried everything! They just don’t like food!” What does it mean that we have held onto the cultural meme of “Not tonight honey, I have a headache”? Women need excuses to get out of sex; not wanting to have sex is not enough of a reason. I think about my grandmother. When she was on a bad date, she would go to the bathroom, hit her nose until she got a nosebleed, and excuse herself, because it was easier to punch herself in the face than suffer the consequences of rejecting a man.
 


After two years of working retail, I was promoted to the head of educational programming for the company that ran the store. And what I experienced in that job gave me an even clearer view into the kinds of anxieties people dealt with around sex — and the inherent imbalances they couldn’t help but run up against.The financial backbone of the educational program was the blow job workshop, by a nearly inconceivable margin. The workshop was designed to be fun, friendly, and hands-on (with bananas). It was our job as teachers to keep the conversation strictly nongendered, and to sneak consent-based content into the material in a way that did not feel preachy, didactic, or off-topic. We had fun! But we also talked about not shaming people for not getting “wet enough,” or how to negotiate boundaries in a casual hookup, or what to do when someone was pushing your head down toward their crotch. I felt so proud to present a blow job workshop that gave people permission to not suck dick if they didn’t want to.But then, we couldn’t sell a cunnilingus workshop to save our lives. Time and time again, workshop participants would ask for it on their evaluation sheets, but inevitably the workshop would get dropped from the schedule due to low ticket sales. We tried lowering the price of the workshop; we changed its name; we offered gift bags and free champagne. It was a victory every time we could actually squeak by our minimum required attendance and run the event. Meanwhile, blow jobs continued to boom. Advertisement  
 


Why? Painting with a broad brush, the majority of the workshop attendees were women who have sex with cisgender men (a category I find myself in too, most of the time). At some point, we all received the steady drip of Shakespearean ear poison telling us that giving amazing blow jobs is one of the skills we need in order to catch and keep a man. As if that’s how any of it works, as if I could staple a list of my womanly skills onto the front of my dress (Sews buttons! Bakes! Graduated from BJ University!) and stand in a town square, waiting to be chosen.Aren’t women taught to hover in anticipation over the question: What did I do wrong? What could I do to make it better? We ask that question about the head we give, but also the head we receive. Too much hair? Not enough? Labia too ugly? Too wet? Too dry? Do my genitals smell? Do they taste bad? Is that why he isn’t going down on me? Afraid of facing retribution for our assertiveness, we instead contort to fit the shapes of someone else’s desire. Why do so many women refuse oral sex? Why are so few straight-identified women having orgasms with their partners? What would it take to sell this fucking workshop?I try to imagine a bachelor party coming into the store for a celebratory cunnilingus event, the groom-to-be adorned in a crown of stylized, glittery cunts. Each man gingerly entering the room, wrapping a hand around a complimentary craft beer for the comfort of a familiar object. Each of them nervous that there is some secret out there to pussy eating that the other men aren’t telling, each of them worried that their girlfriends and wives or Tinder dates will leave them for someone who sucks clit better. I imagine each participant — the groom’s brother, his fiancé’s best guy friend, his cousins — adorned with vulva necklaces, sucking on ripe peaches and juicy mangoes, sitting on foldout chairs in a room of men, howling with laughter and cheering each other on as they practice tongue techniques. Thinking about this makes my heart ache.
 


Can we imagine talking about sex in a way that is not about convincing the other party to advance our agenda, that is not about wearing someone else down, that is not about seeing how much we can get away with? Can we tolerate holding simultaneous truths — that we are adults with agency, and that the cards we are holding have only ever been stacked in one direction?Sex positivity is a powerful concept, but in order to be an actionable philosophy, it has to account for oppression, inequality, and the forces of capitalism. There is value in it, particularly in its capacity to help people identify the value in themselves. But we are only able to live out the tenets of sex positivity through socially conditioned lenses. In order to make sex positivity proliferate in our culture, it has been commodified for ease and popularity. And so, a gulf widens between the message and its meaning, the intent and the execution, and sex becomes yet another way to fail as a woman.The weariness I feel about the unrelenting cheerfulness of much of the movement reminds me of the full-body revulsion I feel when I am enthusiastically told, “We are all one race, the HUMAN race!” — a statement which fails to take into account the social construction of race and racism. We don’t get to decide that the playing field is level now, just because we would really, really like it to be. We can believe in the plurality of sexual expression, the validity of all orientations and identities, but that doesn’t mean we all have the same user experience. Advertisement  
 


I want to believe in sex positivity hard enough to make it real. In many ways, it is a balm to soothe the barbs we sustain in a culture that punishes women for their appetites, that villainizes sexuality and erases the value of sex workers. Finding a sex-positive community was a homecoming in my early twenties, and interacting with a community of outspoken feminists and radical queers poured the foundation for my politic, my heart, my values, my dating life, and for my life’s work.The work I did at the sex toy store was heady and complicated, and required so much more of us than the colloquial “slingin’ dils to pay the bills.” We were retail employees, but we were also counselors and educators, therapists and friends, sex workers and tour guides, vessels and ciphers. We were silly and fun and friendly, but operating within a kind of triage environment, constantly pressing up against the limits of our capabilities. We experienced empathy fatigue, defending our physical and emotional boundaries, and balancing the conflicting forces of keeping a store profitable and trying to do right by people, all while attempting to survive on retail wages. We could not advise others on their liberation while we were making decisions between making rent and affording food. We could not counsel full-throatedly on the importance of safety while we ourselves were in danger. The employees unionized to attain better working conditions, and I put in my notice shortly thereafter. As I packed up to go, I asked myself that end-of-transaction question: Did I find what I was looking for? Not yet. ●

460,"""By 2030 in the United States, we won’t have coal,” US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry claimed this week.","


At the 26th United Nations Conference on Climate Change, diplomats put down on paper, for the first time, the collective need to accelerate phasing out coal and fossil fuels subsidies to meet their climate goals in a draft statement released Wednesday.Countries can either keep using coal at current levels or limit future warming to the 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) target of the Paris climate agreement. It’s impossible to do both. But this scientific reality has been an elephant in the room of high-level international climate negotiations for years — until now. Advertisement     “It’s significant,” Helen Mountford, a vice president at World Resources Institute, told reporters. “We’ve never had a text like that before.”Still, this new declaration isn’t final, has no timeline or other details, and comes along with some murky country-specific pledges. This incongruity on coal captures the central tension playing out at the high-profile climate talks in Glasgow: the glaring gaps between what countries must do to halt the worsening climate crisis, what countries say they will do in the future, and what they are actually doing now.“We’ll see if that text sticks,” Mountford later said. “We’re hoping it will. It’s a really important and concrete action that countries can take to actually deliver on their commitments.”Outside the climate negotiations, protesters pushed for the language to stay in. According to the Washington Post, they chanted: “‘Fossil fuels’ on paper now” and “Keep it in the text.”Even United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres expressed frustration with the negotiations on Thursday, saying that country-level “promises ring hollow when the fossil fuel industry still receives trillions in subsidies, as measured by the IMF. Or when countries are still building coal plants.” Advertisement     With current climate policies in place, the world is on track to warm more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) this century compared to preindustrial levels. Even the most up-to-date tallies of current pledges for future climate action put the world on track to heat up 1.8 degrees Celsius. This means that even if all the countries actually deliver on their most ambitious promises — a big if — we’ll still overshoot the key Paris goal by 0.3 degrees. This may seem like a minor difference, but the science is abundantly clear that every tenth of a degree is disastrous for humanity: more frequent and intense heat waves, droughts, hurricanes, and wildfires; more sea level rise; and, ultimately, more suffering.The science is also clear that coal is just awful for the climate. Coal is the most carbon-intensive energy source, responsible for about 40% of carbon emissions tied to global fossil fuel use.That’s why a growing number of officials are saying that ditching coal is among the most important steps to take for tackling climate change. Just last week, for example, Canadian environment and climate change minister Steven Guilbeault said in Glasgow: “Ending emissions of coal power is one of the single most important steps we must take to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement and the 1.5 degree target.”
 


Climate modeling results published last month by the International Energy Agency show that there’s no way to limit future global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, let alone to 1.5 degrees Celsius, without a reduction in current coal use. Advertisement     IEA’s most aggressive scenario for cutting emissions lays out a road map of how to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and achieve “net-zero” emissions (when the balance of carbon going into the atmosphere equals what’s coming out, via carbon capture, plant life, and other sources of removal). Called the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 or NZE scenario, it involves the halting of new coal plants and reducing emissions from the about 2,100 gigawatts of currently operating power plants globally.“It’s entirely gone from the power sector,” IEA modeler Daniel Crow said about coal in that scenario. “Unabated coal is entirely gone.”A very small amount of coal would remain, likely relying on carbon capture and storage technology to pull resulting carbon emissions directly out of the atmosphere.
 


IEA executive director Fatih Birol took this message to Glasgow at an event organized by the Powering Past Coal Alliance, an organization launched in 2017 devoted to ending coal use. So far, 165 countries, regions, cities, and businesses have signed on. That includes the 28 new members announced at the ongoing climate conference.In many cases, participating countries have outlined phase-out deadlines: Ukraine committed to ending coal use by 2035, Croatia set a deadline of 2033, and Estonia is already coal-free.“For our part in the UK, we’ve reduced the use of coal for electricity down to be incredibly less than 2% of our total usage,” said Greg Hands, cochair of the alliance and a UK minister, at the event. “And it will be gone from our energy mix entirely by 2024.”But in a sign of how messy the international politics on coal are, a separate but overlapping coalition to end coal launched the same day in Glasgow. This second group signed the new “Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement,” committing to, among other things, “end all investment in new coal power generation domestically and internationally” and “phase out coal power in economies in the 2030s for major economies and 2040s for the rest of the world.” Advertisement     Catherine McKenna, Canada’s former environment minister who helped launch the Powering Past Coal Alliance, called out the second coalition for lowering the bar on climate action: Powering Past Coal requires all countries to phase out coal before 2040.
 


One of the most significant signatories of the new statement was Poland, a country that heavily relies on coal. Poland boasted one of the 25 largest GDPs in 2020. This led many to deduce Poland, a major economy, was seeking to stop coal use in the 2030s. But country officials quickly pushed back, saying the country was planning to phase out coal in the 2040s, possibly as late as 2049.South Korea, another major coal consumer, also signed the statement last week, seemingly committing to ditch coal by the end of the next decade. The country’s trade minister has since walked back the commitment, issuing a statement saying: “We support accelerating the transition to clean power, but we never agreed to a date for the transition away from coal.”Neither the US nor China, two of the world’s leading producers of coal, signed on to either coalition. As members of the Group of 20, or G20, these countries had already agreed this year to stop financing coal projects overseas.Then, this week, John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy for climate, told Bloomberg in an interview: “By 2030 in the United States, we won’t have coal.” The next day he, on behalf of the US, announced with China that both countries had mutually agreed to up their climate ambition and reiterated their commitments to stop helping international coal projects. While China agreed to “make best efforts to accelerate” a coal phase down, no date was given. The future of coal in the US was not mentioned at all. Advertisement     
 


Even if more politicians are only beginning to state the obvious about coal’s future in a warmer world, the shift away from the dirtiest fossil fuel is already underway.Take the US. According to the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign, about 348 coal plants in the US have already retired or announced retirements in the past decade. That leaves about 182 currently operating plants around the country.“That’s a ton of progress in 10 years,” Cherelle Blazer, a Sierra Club senior director, told BuzzFeed News. “As far as I know, there aren’t any plans for new coal plants.”Seth Feaster, an energy data analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, offered even more context for America’s move away from coal. “Only 10 years ago was the peak of how much power we could generate from coal,” he explained. “In other words, between 2011 and 2020, we retired almost a third of all the coal capacity.”Another third is set to retire in the coming decade, Feaster added, leaving the US with about one-third of its peak coal capacity by 2030 — and he expects this rapid decline will continue to accelerate.This all happened despite the election of Donald Trump, who ran for US president on the promise to end the “war on coal” and whose administration then aggressively rolled back coal rules.So does that put Kerry’s recently stated goal of no more coal in the US by 2030 within reach? Eh, not quite. Even Feaster said that’s a “still fairly optimistic goal.”Complicating matters is the fate of US President Joe Biden’s ambitious climate legislation at the center of his Build Back Better plan. The single most obstructive person to getting those new climate policies over the finish line is West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, whose personal fortune is built on coal. Now there are discussions about whether tax incentives he’s pushing to be included for technologies that capture carbon pollution will keep coal plants running longer. Advertisement     The shuttering of coal plants across the US has pushed the country’s climate emissions downward. But in coal’s wake, natural gas helped fill the gap. So as coal-related emissions went down, natural gas emissions went up. This type of energy switch won’t halt the climate crisis.“These countries that are planning to move away from coal should be very, very careful not to get themselves into locking emissions by switching to another fossil fuel — gas — and focus on changing this to renewable energy,” warned María José de Villafranca, a climate policy analyst at NewClimate Institute, this week.

461,People who operate on the fringes of Instagram’s community guidelines are turning to dealers who say they have a back door to the platform.,"


In January 2021, the Instagram account for Julia Rose’s magazine, ShagMag, got banned from the platform.Rose received a message saying that the account for the online pinup publication had violated Instagram’s rules regarding nudity and impersonation. She had tried to play by the rules, but her posts had been reported and suspended multiple times for alleged nudity. She said she reached out to Instagram to appeal but had no success. Advertisement     For influencers like Rose who rely on Instagram for the promotion of their work as well as sponsorship deals, losing an account can be a massive blow to their income, leaving them desperate to get it back at any cost. But Rose had one more option. After her appeals to Instagram went unanswered, a friend put her in touch with a man who told her he could help her get her account back — for a price.The man claimed he had a connection to a supervisor at Facebook, which owns Instagram. He sent her a contract saying he could restore the account, as well as her personal account, which had also been banned for alleged nudity, in exchange for $65,000 and a 2.5% stake in her company. The contract, which has been reviewed by BuzzFeed News, came from an LLC currently registered in Florida that promised it could not only restore her accounts but protect them from future takedowns.
 


Rose, unwilling to give up part of her company, didn’t take the deal, and whether this man truly had a Facebook insider is a mystery. (He refused to answer questions when contacted by BuzzFeed News, and Facebook declined to comment on Rose’s allegations.)Rose’s experience is not unique. Multiple people who operate on the fringes of Instagram’s community guidelines, such as adult performers and cannabis influencers, told BuzzFeed News they’ve resorted to desperate measures after losing an Instagram account, turning to dealers who say they have a back door to the platform. These dealers, who often claim to either work for Facebook or know someone who does, charge hundreds or thousands of dollars for their work. If the account gets deleted again, the price goes up.While some of these people appear to be scammers who have no actual power over Instagram’s moderation, sources in the influencer community who BuzzFeed News spoke to said it appears some of these dealers actually have access that allows them to instantly restore an account.It’s good business. When creators’ appeals to Instagram are met with silence, many say they feel they have no choice but to pay up. Cannabis influencer and business owner Olivia Alexander told BuzzFeed News these types of business dealings have become an open secret in the creator economy.“They pay the money, they get their account back, and they don’t talk about it,” she said.In response to the allegations in this story, a spokesperson for Facebook told BuzzFeed News that if the company discovered its employees were soliciting funds or coordinating secret efforts with creators to reinstate their accounts, it would be a serious HR violation. They did not confirm or deny knowledge that any Facebook or Instagram employees were involved in the schemes.But hypothetically, the spokesperson said, creators should know that anyone claiming to have under-the-table access would be operating outside of the platform’s regulations, and anyone who engages with them runs the risk of being exploited.“Any individual who reports to be able to help people get back into their account is most likely doing so with malicious intent, i.e., scamming or phishing the person on the other end,” they said. The company is trying to improve its internal system for flagging accounts to ensure bans are being issued fairly and appeals are handled quickly. Advertisement     “We want Instagram to be a place where people can express themselves, but we also have a responsibility to keep people safe,” the spokesperson said in an official statement. “We try to write policies that adequately balance freedom of expression and safety, but doing this for a community of a billion people from all corners of the world will always be challenging. That’s why we are constantly re-evaluating our policies and working with experts to ensure we are in the right place.""
 


Creators whose work is often flagged as violations of Instagram’s community guidelines are the most likely to fall prey to these backdoor dealers. Anyone posting risqué content — even if it abides by the community guidelines — runs a risk of their posts being taken down, whether by AI or human moderation. The guidelines prohibit nudity, glorifying self-injury, and support for hate groups, among other content.Alexander, the cannabis influencer, estimates she's spent $25,000 paying to get accounts back. She started on Instagram in 2013 with cannabis culture accounts, growing her business into a digital agency that handles her accounts as well as those of clients.Around 2015, Alexander said, she started having issues with Instagram taking down multiple accounts she managed, such as her own @weed.bae. (Facebook said it restored the account after an inquiry from BuzzFeed News.) A friend, Mike Smith, put her in touch with a man who claimed to work for Facebook. Smith also works in the cannabis space, running a pinup photography account called Ganja Girls, which he said was hacked and taken down about seven years ago.“I was devastated. I worked on Ganja Girls since the beginning of Instagram,” he told BuzzFeed News.Two days after his account was hacked, Smith said, a person he described as a “young kid” with “like 600 followers” hit him up on Instagram.“He said, ‘I’m a big fan of Ganja Girls, I saw you got hacked, let me help you get your account back,’” Smith said.Smith said the guy delivered — instantly restoring the account for free. According to Smith, the man said he had access to Instagram’s tools through his job and offered to continue working with Smith.“He says, ‘Do you know anybody else who needs their accounts back, or unhacked? I’m looking to make some extra cash,’” Smith said.Though Smith has screenshots of their messages, when contacted, the man denied knowledge of their interactions. Facebook did not comment on the man’s involvement when asked by BuzzFeed News.Smith also ran accounts for clients, so the two started working together. When someone lost their account, the man would set a fee, and he and Smith would split the payment.“He did everything — he did unhacking, he did deleting accounts, he did merging accounts together,” Smith said. The charges ranged from a few hundred up to $4,000, said Smith.He said his contact eventually got out of the scheme, but Smith still has a hookup that does account restoration for him. He declined to divulge their name for fear of losing his access. He said he’s speaking out now because when the first contact got out of the scheme, Smith continued to have issues with his accounts, and the man declined to keep helping him. Advertisement     With Smith’s help, Alexander said, she not only got accounts restored but paid to get them verified. She suspects Facebook employees are doing this without the company knowing.“It’s really important people understand that these social media platforms and big tech can’t regulate their own employees,” Alexander said. Facebook did not respond to this allegation when asked by BuzzFeed News.Cali Rockowitz, an artist and microinfluencer who was previously featured in a BuzzFeed News story, said that over the last six months or so, she’s received multiple notifications from Instagram about her art and merch account, @sorrydadco. Instagram has banned some of her posts and blocked her from using functions like going live. A few weeks ago, Instagram suspended her account for “nudity” and “sexual activity” violations. (When BuzzFeed News reached a spokesperson at Instagram on Friday and sent them a list of suspended accounts for this story, Rockowitz’s account was suddenly reinstated. Until then, she said, she had not heard from anyone at the company for almost a month.) She maintains that her paintings and renderings on shirts and prints that supposedly violated their standards were artistic and “not raunchy.”
 


Rockowitz told BuzzFeed News that she tried several times to go through the official appeal process to regain control of her account, which had around 15,000 followers. Since selling her art and merch through Instagram is one of her main sources of income, she hastily created a secondary account as a backup.“My heart dropped when they just deleted my account,” she said. “[The company is] claiming it is adult solicitation and nudity. Neither are true. They are targeting me for my paintings, which are impressionist style, not even hyperrealistic ... The content I post on Instagram is extremely tasteful and in no way soliciting for sex or posting nude images.” Advertisement     Out of desperation, she got in contact through a friend with a guy they knew that was “super tech-savvy.” The man claimed to her that for $300, he could create bots to file “like 300-400 claims to Instagram” to restore her account to “increase the chances that a case is opened,” his messages to her read.Rockowitz paid him, but her account remained down, even after several spamming attempts. He did, however, promise her that she would get a refund if it didn’t work out.“It’s my last hope — I've been filling out forms and sending emails every day for a week now with no response from Instagram,” she said. (The man who coordinated the hack refused an interview with BuzzFeed News.)Rockowitz was also connected to someone who she was told was “high up in the content department at Instagram,” but they refused to help because they “will not go near anything that is related to sex,” she was told.Chantal Convertini, a photographer based in Switzerland with over 138,000 followers on her Instagram account, told BuzzFeed News she’s received several notices starting in 2019 for her photographs of human bodies. Most of them are carefully posed and censored, although some feature nudity.
 


According to Convertini, the account, @paeulini, was recently suspended because she had “used sexual language” and “sold sexual actions,” she said the notice read. (A spokesperson at Instagram denied her account was ever banned.) Convertini said she “laughed out loud” when she got the ban because she thought it was a joke. She attempted to appeal but had not heard from anyone at Instagram for about nine days. Instagram did not provide a comment on what happened with her account.After her account was suspended, she had a friend put her in contact with someone who worked at Facebook. “All I did was to send my account info and what happened” to the internal contact, she said, noting she did not have to pay for this service. Her account then mysteriously reappeared. Advertisement     “I have no idea how my account came back in the end. I didn't hear back from them either,” she said.Even though Convertini has her account back, she is still mystified and frustrated by why her content was pulled down in the first place and by the lack of communication with anyone at Instagram and Facebook.“[The fact] that we have to explain why we are not a ‘danger to society’ is awful ... I mean, come on. [My work is] just so obviously art and not anything else,” she said. “[Mean]while Playboy and celebs and pornstars have their accounts on Insta and can seemingly do what the hell they want on there. It’s such a big double standard I could roll my eyes backwards.”In response to this apparent double standard, the Facebook spokesperson stated simply, “We only remove content that violate our policies.” They directed BuzzFeed News to the platform’s guidelines on adult nudity.This situation is very familiar for adult entertainers, who can be prime targets for takedowns and people soliciting restoration services, according to Alana Evans. Evans is the president of Adult Performance Artists Guild, a union that works with adult film workers, online content creators, and phone sex workers.The guild’s lawyer, Jim Felton, said they’ve identified hundreds of people in the adult space who have had accounts deleted or suspended by Instagram. Some fall victim to people claiming they can restore those accounts.“I don’t know for certain who is doing the scamming. We have been told that it’s not employees, other people seem to think that it might be,” he said.The spokesperson for Facebook confirmed the company has been in contact with the guild to discuss these issues. Evans said her biggest pet peeve is when members get their accounts removed from Instagram with no warning and what seems to be little hope of recovery.She said the other downside of this shadow economy is that while there are people out there who indeed seem to be able to restore accounts, plenty of others are merely scammers who will take your money and deliver nothing. Advertisement     “This fraud that’s happening has been prevalent,” Evans told BuzzFeed News, claiming she knows of at least a dozen adult performers who have been “scammed by different groups.”“That has happened to multiple adult performers, and for the most part, it hasn’t worked at all. Sometimes they get it back for a short period of time and then it goes away again,” she added.Every time, performers are left in limbo.“It is such an immense, traumatizing impact,” Evans said.“Having your brand be able to be out there and advertise, without advertising your direct porn, is important for us because it keeps your fanbase engaged with you as a person,” she said.Facebook confirmed that the company reinstated four of the nine Instagram accounts (@sorrydad, @hillarylux, @weed.bae, and @paeulini) mentioned in this story. The other five, they said, “were actioned properly” and remain banned. When asked why these accounts specifically were restored over the others, the company rep responded, “There is no singular answer for these actions.”“Some of the violations which led to account removals were false-positives, and once the content was restored, the individuals were able to regain access to their accounts. That was not the case for all the accounts you shared, and upon further review, some were still repeated violators of our policies, and therefore have lost access.”The moral and technical issues surrounding Instagram’s sex and cannabis policies and punishments have been controversial for years. Oftentimes, smaller creators trying to advocate for social progress are the ones penalized, while large, commercially successful accounts like @playboy and @hustler continue to be able to post similar imagery freely.Facebook/Instagram did not specifically address this when asked but maintain, again, that they only take action against accounts that violate their policies, however their algorithm is triggered to do so.Creators in these communities want Instagram and Facebook to set healthy and consistent standards — especially for pro-sex and cannabis posts that are meant to be provocative and not dangerous.Convertini said she wants Instagram to “have a responsibility towards our society’s norms and standards of how a body is seen.”“It is very dangerous how [Instagram] cuts off artistic nude expression,” she said. “They portray a world in which a woman in lingerie, in super short clothes, posing sexy and suggestive, is totally okay, while any portrait or any expression of nudity in a nonsexualized context is taken down or shadowbanned. I cannot believe that they are not able to program a better algorithm, or that they don't find any better solutions for this problem.” Advertisement     Creators also want the company to know that an AI-triggered ban can be so easy on its end to inflict but has a lasting, stressful impact on users who now depend on the platform for their incomes.“The desperation I felt,” Rockowitz said. “Instagram is so big that they don’t really need me or my business, but they took down my whole source of income. Everything I’ve built. They don’t have the perspective of the lives they could be ruining by a click of a button.”

463,Solar Power fits in with a pop moment where some superstars are pulling back and no longer striving for ubiquity.,"


In her brilliant 2019 book, How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy, Jenny Odell warns against “context collapse,” or the ways technology can flatten us into the most universal version of ourselves. For many of us, that happens automatically online — we begin writing for an imagined broad audience, the lowest common denominator. Frequently, it makes for a barrage of ubiquitous, impersonal, and inoffensive communication that ultimately doesn’t mean much. But what if we worried less about “people who have no context for us,” Odell wondered in a 2019 Vox interview, and instead focused on speaking to people who know us and want to hear from us? What would we say then?Lorde recently told the New York Times that Odell’s book was one of the inspirations for her third album, Solar Power, which arrived last week. After a four-year hiatus, the singer has returned with a bright album that wants you to slow down, put away your phone, maybe even delete your social media, look up to the sky, and “hope the sun will show us the path.” Ocean waves and cicadas are woven into the sonic landscape. Notice the trees. Notice the grass under your bare feet. Take a seat, man. Relax. Advertisement  It’s a steady album, devoid of Lorde’s signature big choruses. Scan its 12 tracks and you’ll find a record entirely unconcerned with hit-making. Lorde is no longer in the smash business. She’s fresh out of bangers. Alongside the shift in focus, Lorde has also telegraphed a shift in ambition: She told the Wall Street Journal she doesn’t want to play arenas anymore. “I would much rather have a room with 5,000 people in it who know every word to every song … than have 18,000 people who heard two songs on the radio and liked them,” she said. “I’m an amphitheater girl. I’m a 150-year-old theater girl.”So the old Lorde can’t come to the phone right now. The scaled-back sounds of Solar Power make for an album that is only interested in its own rubric for success, satisfied to lounge and breathe deeply. It’s also not on its own: Solar Power fits in with a pop moment where other stars like Billie Eilish are pulling back, no longer expanding their audience at all costs and no longer striving for ubiquity. Welcome to the age of the reluctant pop star.
 


For much of her time in the limelight, Lorde made songs that resolved in euphoria, built to be shouted from the rooftops and the nosebleeds. Lorde, whose real name is ​​Ella Yelich-O’Connor, exploded on the scene with force: Her first single, the infectious “Royals,” spent nine weeks at No. 1.“Royals” nabbed two Grammys and a bouquet of accolades. It helped push her debut album, 2013’s Pure Heroine, to triple-platinum status in the US. The song was a triumph, and it was also unmistakably on her own terms. It was an outsiders’ anthem. It was the pop song for the skeptics: “We aren’t caught up in your love affair,” she declared. David Bowie hailed Lorde as “the future of music.”How do you top that? Well, how about with one of the best pop albums of the decade? Lorde followed up Pure Heroine with 2017’s Melodrama, a taut and precise record built around the concept of “the arc of an evening,” which is a more poetic way of saying the events of a single house party. Advertisement  
 


Melodrama gave Lorde new bona fides as a songwriter and producer. She broke the rules and got away with it: She revealed that she played the album’s lead single, “Green Light,” to legendary pop producer Max Martin, and he told her that the song was a demonstration of “incorrect songwriting.” Not that she took it personally: Martin knows how to make a hit, and “Green Light” does not cohere with what we know about hits. That kind of boundary-pushing earned Melodrama a nomination for Album of the Year. In 2020, just three years after the album came out, Rolling Stone admitted it into its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list, at No. 460.The thing is: 460 feels low. Check this space in a decade, because Melodrama will climb into the 200s as its influence continues to ripple out. In the span of two albums, Lorde managed to push the reset button on what pop expects from women — or as the Ringer put it, Lorde “completely rewrote the rules for young women making radio-friendly pop.” Namely, she offered a new path, away from what the New Yorker called the “sugary-sweet, overtly sexual realm” and toward something more internal, brooding, and at times even feral.Still, Lorde’s sphere of influence was not limited to aesthetics and thematics. Her sonic descendants number a dozen, too: Her trademark conversational singing — at times dropping as low as a whisper — is the lingua franca of pop today. The Spinoff pointed out that her natural singing mode is now so common, “it’s easy to forget it would not have been associated with pop ten years ago or fewer.” There is no shortage of household names that owe a great debt to Lorde’s success — the likes of Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo, Alessia Cara, Halsey, and Daya just to name a few.So what do you do when you’ve recalibrated the standards for pop music? Lorde opted to disappear. She deleted her social media pages and retreated to New Zealand. “That whole Lorde thing doesn’t and hasn’t really come up,” one of her friends told the New York Times. “I’ve probably said the word ‘Lorde’ maybe like — I can count it on one hand.” She surfaced again this summer, but when she came back, the vibes had shifted.
 


Solar Power opens with a double-barrelled thesis statement. There’s “The Path,” a flute-heavy, cicada-sampling track that reminds us of where Lorde started (“teen millionaire having nightmares from the camera flash”) and where she is now (“Now I’m alone on a windswept island”). Proudly, she declares she “won’t take the call if it’s the label or the radio.” Lorde bursts the listener’s expectations early: “if you’re looking for a savior, that’s not me,” she softly sings. Then onto the title track, a bouncy song inviting you to feel renewed by the warmth of the sun.The pair of opening tracks are a signal of what’s to come: Far from being an album obsessed with the trappings of modern pop stardom, it’s a record about divestment from those ideas. This isn’t to say she is doing less — her melodies are still complex. Her writing is sharp as hell (“You felled me clean as a pine”). She is still making use of her sing-speaking superpower.But much of the album resists the big choruses of Lorde’s previous work. No catharsis, just vibes. It’s definitely a headphone album; its gifts are in the layering and the execution of subtle details. There is no dancefloor payoff here — and for an artist who was so adept at delivering those payoffs, it is at first jarring that they are so scarce. But Solar Power rewards repeat listens. “Secrets From a Girl,” a heartfelt letter to her younger self, elicits a tender, nostalgic feeling, aided by Robyn on the outro, playing a flight attendant welcoming you to “sadness” after a flight on “Strange Airlines.” Meanwhile, “Dominoes” shows off Lorde’s fidelity to writing a hook, immediately undercut by the quiet acoustic guitar and the distant ambulance sirens in the background. Advertisement  On “California,” Lorde is forthcoming about how fame began to seep into her life, recalling when Carole King presented her with the Grammy for Song of the Year in 2014 (“Once upon a time in Hollywood / when Carole called my name”), but the song transforms into a breakup song with superstardom (“I don’t miss the poisoned arrows aimed directly at my head”). On the very next track, Lorde makes room for doubt about her new direction — “Got a wishbone drying on the windowsill in my kitchen / just in case I wake up and realize I’ve chosen wrong,” she sings.Lorde remains one step ahead of you: If all of this business about leaving fame behind and following the sun feels a little woo-woo, she warns that she is not advocating that we take up wellness culture. She satirizes the Goop-y approach to mental health (“I’m tryna get well from the inside / Plants and celebrity news / All the vitamins I consume”) on the album’s third single, “Mood Ring.”As an album, Solar Power works fine. As an argument, it works even better. Lorde is setting clear boundaries with this record. This isn't about earning radio play or expanding the fan base. Hell, it isn’t even about fan service. It’s, specifically, about not creating music for the lowest common denominator. It’s music that would sound odd in an arena. There is, in Solar Power, a hyperspecificity that runs counter to the demands of music that appeals to masses. This is, perhaps, a version of Odell’s prescription: creating for people who have context for you. It’s the album version of making your world smaller and delighting in the details.

Lorde is not the only one making her world smaller. Solar Power feels like it is in conversation with Billie Eilish’s latest offering, Happier Than Ever, which was released in late July and debuted at No. 1. Happier, Eilish’s follow-up to the monster success of 2019’s When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, is similarly suspicious of pop ubiquity. “Things I once enjoyed,” croons Eilish on the album opener, “just keep me employed now.” Make no mistake about it: She’s clocking in for work, and that’s the extent of this relationship.Eilish’s initial breakthrough was a bit of a mystery. She emerged as her own subculture, a supernova of youth internet culture, a veritable IYKYK. At first she seemed cagey about even trying to speak to a wider audience. Even as she got more attention, she took her time releasing a debut album — nearly four years passed between when Eilish dropped “Ocean Eyes” on SoundCloud and the release of her studio album. By the time she was being acknowledged in mainstream music press, she already had a billion streams. Advertisement  In other words, she didn’t really need the machinery of pop stardom to blow up. She went years without a banger to speak of — that is, until “Bad Guy.” A slinky, vampy mega hit, “Bad Guy” broke multiple records and catapulted her to superstardom. It ended the legendary 19-week run of “Old Town Road” at No. 1, and in the process made Eilish the first artist born in the 2000s to score a chart-topper.One imagines that after the overwhelming success of “Bad Guy,” Eilish’s label might have offered her the world. If she wanted, she probably could have worked with any big-name producer or any of the dozen or so reliable hitmakers. Instead, she leaned deeper into her partnership with her brother Finneas, who produces and cowrites all of her music.
 


Sonically, a couple of songs nod in the direction of “Bad Guy,” but Happier is frequently a down-tempo, interior record. This isn’t to say it’s dull: “NDA” gives a moving account of Eilish attempting to find her way around love while being famous. Meanwhile, “Your Power” takes on abusive older men. It’s just not an album obsessed with casting a wide net or elbowing for room on the radio.Instead, it’s entirely about boundaries. Happier’s main thesis is the tension between wanting to create and perform music in public, and how much the public is entitled to. And why should the public be entitled to more? Eilish has been through the ringer, from stalkers to body shamers. Her motivations may be different than Lorde’s, but you get the impression that she is keeping her world small to survive, too.On the other end of the spectrum, there’s Justin Bieber. The singer released Changes in 2020 and seemed so happy and in his element singing R&B songs and keeping distance from pop superstardom. Accompanying Changes, Bieber released a 10-part documentary series that chronicled how the dizzying heights of fame nearly killed him.But he returned in 2021 aiming for total dominance with Justice, an album that was vague and centerless. It’s not even convincing that he wants to be going through the pop star motions. Slot in Shawn Mendes there too.All of this raises the prospect that perhaps we should stop calling on these people to perform the traditional duties of pop stars. They don’t seem interested in the job. Or more precisely, the obligations of being a star, of making music with democratic appeal, are starting to seem like impositions.On “White Teeth Teens,” from Lorde’s debut album, she sings about the allure of popular kids and their gravitational pull. But on the bridge of the song, her voice drops low, as if she’s leaning in close. “I’ll let you in on something big,” she tells the listener. “I am not a white teeth teen / I tried to join, but never did / The way they are, the way they seem.” From the beginning, Lorde was staking out her ground: I want in, but I am suspicious.On Solar Power, Lorde telegraphs that her early suspicions were proven right, that being an insider, an avatar of a pop star is not for her. She told the Times that rather than thinking of her hiatus as a pause from her famous-singer life, it’s the inverse. Her non-famous life, with her friends and family, that’s the default: “I’m like, ‘Oh, no, no, no — this is a break from my life.’ I come back and perform these duties because I believe in the album.” You get the sense that she’s following her own advice, too — “Spend all the evenings you can with the people who raised you,” she sings on “Stoned at the Nail Salon.”The pandemic has accelerated a move away from entwining your work with your identity, and there is no good reason why that shouldn’t apply to pop stars. Real life, as Lorde describes it, is the sturdy stuff — the place you live and the people who surround you and, from time to time, noticing the sunlight on your face — not the responsibilities and the constant cycle of trying to speak to people who don’t have much of a context for you. Yes, there is work to be done, but after you clock out, you can go home, turn inward, and connect with the place where joy comes from for you. “Come on and let the bliss begin,” Lorde sings. Just follow the sun. ●

464,"After Black Lives Matter protests broke out across the country, sororities promised to do better for their Black members. But many believe the sentiments are hollow.","


In 2018, Natalie Wilson was playing in an intramural softball game at Iowa State University when an incident occurred that is forever etched in her mind.Some of her sisters in her sorority, Sigma Kappa, attended the game and, as she played, held up a sign that read: “Token.” The sign meant that Wilson, the only Black member of the sorority at the time, was the chapter’s “Token Black Girl” — referencing an “award” her sisters had given Wilson months prior. Advertisement     Wilson’s claim of racism in her sorority is not unique (neither Sigma Kappa at Iowa State University nor its headquarters responded to multiple requests for comment on her allegations). Sororities and fraternities have made headlines for their apparent racist antics, parties, and membership selection over the years, with members coming under fire for wearing blackface, dressing in racially inappropriate costumes, and allegations of not giving bids to women of color.During the racial justice protests of 2020, several Greek organizations, and their parent organization, the National Panhellenic Conference, released statements vowing to address racism in their midst.However, the NPC's statement rang hollow to many Black former sorority members.“I don’t think it was sincere, and I don’t think they even cared,” Bria Jones, a former sorority member at the University of Arkansas, told BuzzFeed News. “It’s kind of scary though, because I don’t know who actually cares enough to change it.” Advertisement     But many Black sorority members do care enough to try to make real changes in Greek life. Now, emboldened by the racial justice movement of 2020, these women are speaking out. They believe that sororities have a choice: They can either completely reimagine the way they operate or continue to fail their Black members.Ameena Challenger, who is Black and was a member of a sorority at St. Louis University from 2014 to 2018, told BuzzFeed News she believes sororities need to be completely reimagined for women of color to feel truly welcomed.“If sororities come from protecting, validating, and sectioning off white femininity and white womanhood, then it can only change so much,” Challenger said.In a statement to BuzzFeed News about the allegations in this story, Dani Weatherford, CEO of the National Panhellenic Conference, said: “In the past few years, the conference has been clear about the need to recognize and correct the ways the sorority community has historically benefited and centered the experiences of white women and women of privilege. We believe that we must acknowledge the impact of past and current policies and systems that stand in the way of the inclusive communities we seek to create. But we’ve made and are making crucial progress at the NPC level, member organizational level and chapter level to make our community more diverse, inclusive and culturally competent – while seeking to break down systemic barriers.”
 


Several incidents have thrust racism in Greek life under the microscope over the past year.Most notably, a scandal erupted around Bachelor contestant Rachael Kirkconnell, who apologized after photos of her at an Old South fraternity party, where she wore an Antebellum-style dress for a plantation-themed ball, went viral. The incident reignited the discussion about Greek life in the South. Advertisement     A few weeks ago, as Alabama’s rush took over TikTok, many women felt emboldened to share their stories of bad experiences in Greek organizations. Some spoke out about getting in trouble for what they posted on Instagram. Others talked about the cliquey nature of sororities, and some even went so far as to call it a cult.The National Panhellenic Conference oversees 26 national and international sororities, including all of the ones mentioned in this piece. When the first sorority was founded in the 1800s, it was a way for the few women on college campuses to bond, said Diana Turk, who wrote Bound by a Mighty Vow: Sisterhood and Women's Fraternities, 1870-1920. When Black women and Jewish women started to attend college, some sororities began having written or unwritten rules excluding minority groups, Turk said.During the racial justice protests of 2020, the NPC promised they would put a new focus on racial diversity. In a June 2020 blog post, NPC directors addressed the issue of race and said they must “consider — and change — the systems and norms within the Panhellenic community that have historically benefited and centered the experiences of white women and women of privilege, more generally.” Many sorority chapters also posted statements promising to do better.However, many Black sorority members want the NPC to pay more than just lip service to diversity. The Black sorority members who spoke to BuzzFeed News all came from different schools and different chapters but shared one common experience. They all said they, like Wilson, faced racial bias during their time in Greek life and think it will take more than promises to do better to change the culture.Victoria Liverpool, who is Black and was a Sigma Delta Tau at the University of Rochester from 2019 to 2021, said she has been particularly outraged to watch her sorority’s response to the racial justice movement of 2020. Liverpool said she faced microaggressions the entire time she was a member of Sigma Delta Tau.When BLM protests broke out, Liverpool claimed she asked the chapter’s board, of which she was serving as a member, if she could write a statement. Instead, she said, the chapter president wrote one on her own and posted it with a photo of the sorority’s motto, “One hope of many people.” Advertisement     “I can’t even call it a statement,” Liverpool told BuzzFeed News.It was Liverpool’s final straw with Sigma Delta Tau. Liverpool sent an email to the board, which she posted on Twitter, announcing she would resign.
 


“I refuse to work with people who don't want to hear me or care about me as a black woman,” she wrote on Twitter. “I love the girls of this organization but I cannot be a part of something where I have to fight everyday.”Kelovey DeBraux, who is Black and served on the sorority’s board along with Liverpool, said she resigned for the same reasons.“I cannot in good conscience serve a board that seemingly does not regard black women’s lives and opinions equally for a day more,” DeBraux wrote in the email announcing her resignation, referencing Liverpool’s allegations. “I cannot serve a board that is led by individuals with such a narrow understanding of the world and its impact on different cultures around them.”Arielle Savoy, the current interim vice president of Sigma Delta Tau at the University of Rochester, told BuzzFeed News that the president who posted that statement was “dismissed” from the sorority. Savoy said the sorority has implemented bylaw changes and discussions to make sure everyone is heard. Savoy, who is Black, said she feels “welcome and heard” in the sorority.Microaggressions were a common experience related by Black sorority members. Alex, a former sorority member at the University of Alabama, who is biracial, said she faced them from the beginning of her membership in 2014.When Alex, whose name has been changed to protect her anonymity, entered one sorority house during recruitment week, she said she heard women whisper, “I’m kind of upset that the Black girl didn’t drop.”She said her sorority sisters referred to her as “that Black girl” constantly throughout her three-year membership from 2014 to 2017. When she emailed the sorority’s president detailing her experiences with her sisters and asking to be treated with respect, the sorority president responded with an email (which BuzzFeed News reviewed) five days later, where she apologized for her late reply but not for the members’ actions. Advertisement     Instead, she asked for the women’s names so she could talk to them. Alex didn’t think the response sufficed, so she didn’t bring up the issue again.“It felt like they just wanted to sweep it under the rug since I was clearly one of the few people adamant about changing the culture for the better,” she said. “I thought about just dropping, but at that point, I also didn’t want to give the girls satisfaction of me dropping or leaving the sorority so I stayed.”Even sisters who are not women of color told BuzzFeed News they were disturbed by the casual racism they witnessed during their time in Greek life. Mackenna, who is white, and was a member of Gamma Phi Beta at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga from 2016 to 2018, told BuzzFeed News racism was omnipresent in her sorority experience.Mackenna, who declined to give her last name, recalled one sorority activity, where she said she heard her sorority sister say that her favorite thing to do with her dad was drive through poor neighborhoods and watch the “porch monkeys.” Mackenna claims she told board members and was “vocal” about how wrong it was, but nothing was done.“It was so common for people to say the n-word, whether it was in conversation or in a song,” Mackenna said. “And there was really no shame to it or even an understanding of why it’s wrong, which in itself is concerning.”In a statement in response to Mackenna’s claims about the complaints she made, a spokesperson for the national chapter of Gamma Phi Beta said it was “unaware of this incident until today, but we can assure you that we will work towards identifying this member and following our international disciplinary process.”Many Black women said they faced discrimination from their first interactions with sororities. Some recounted painful experiences they had during the recruitment process, or “rush,” where potential new members visit their college’s sorority houses and meet with members. Advertisement     Jana Mathews, an associate professor of English at Rollins College, who is writing a book about Greek life said sororities participate in what they call “values-based recruitment,” which means they choose new members based on shared beliefs and common interests. Since that is pretty vague, Mathews said it is ripe for implicit bias.“Most white fraternity and sorority members don't see themselves as racist, but they have no problem dropping a person of color from their recruiting pool because of ‘fit issues,’” Mathews told BuzzFeed News. “What they don't see or understand is how hobbies and interests are racially coded in America, and that a ‘bad fit’ is just a softer way of saying that people of color don't belong.”While Mathews was researching for her book, she sat in on one sorority’s recruitment week. She said white potential new members got “glowing reviews,” while several members used microaggressions to describe a Black potential new member, like calling her “loud” and “crazy.”Even when sororities did choose them, the Black sisters said they faced conflict. Melina Psihountas, a Phi Mu at the University of Missouri from 2017 to 2018, told BuzzFeed News she was the only Black woman in her pledge class, yet her sorority was considered one of the more racially diverse sororities on campus. The sorority’s reputation as “racially diverse” also led it to be considered a “bottom house,” she said. (Phi Mu headquarters did not respond to a request for comment.)Mary, who is white and declined to give her last name, but who was in a sorority in the South, said that during recruitment week in 2015 when she and her sisters were deciding who to let in, several women shared microaggressions toward the Black potential new members.“I just remember hearing women who I thought I shared similar values with say things along the lines of, ‘We don’t need women like that in our chapter,’” Mary said.
 


Sororities and the NPC now face the weighty task of following through with their pledges to do better. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Weatherford, the NPC’s CEO, said the organization is aware that it has historically centered around white women and women of privilege. The conference is making changes to ensure a more diverse system, including ending legacy policies that disadvantaged women of color, created diverse leadership positions, and launched recruitment reform committees to help all women join sororities, she said.Jones, the former sorority member at the University of Arkansas, said that if sororities are really interested in making a change, they could start by really listening, including, and promoting Black women.“There should be more people speaking to the perspective of minorities because that’s the only way to make change,” Jones said. “They don’t know what we feel like and they don’t care to know what we feel like, they’re not asking and nobody’s telling.” She also believes representation is important, and that women of color should be in leadership roles.Some members are also advocating for themselves. Sydney Roberts, who is in Alpha Phi at the University of California, Berkeley, said that even though she is Black, she has light skin and benefits from colorism. She said she hasn’t experienced racism directly within her sorority, but she has felt out of place at times. This year, she is the diversity chair for her sorority, and with the help of her sisters, she has implemented practices to help women of color feel more welcome.“We’re doing pre-recruitment training to talk about topics like racism and implicit bias and heteronormativity, classism, microaggressions,” Roberts said.For Wilson, it took her years to finally understand why being called the token Black woman was wrong.“It took me a while to get over the shame I felt for not speaking up in those moments, but growth and education has happened over those three, four, five years now to get me to the young educated Black woman that I am,” she said.

"
465,Technology has made avoiding painful memories impossible.,"


On a recent five-hour flight, I was wholly without Wi-Fi. It was a welcome reprieve from the internet, but instead of reading a book or doing anything productive, I spent three hours scrolling through the photos in my phone — I have thousands dating back to 2007. My friend, who sat beside me, had tens of thousands of photos on hers dating back even further. As we mindlessly scrolled, we found moments that we had spent together over the past decade, even though we don’t live in the same city. There were also chunks of time that I sped over, uninterested in feeling the sharp pain of seeing people who are no longer in my life. But they were there too.In the endless scroll, I found a cluster of photos of my mother feeding animals at a wild animal park in Texas. My mother died in the fall of 2019, but in these photos she was smiling and full of life. Which isn’t to say she wasn’t already sick — it was just her decline hadn’t yet become severe. I had taken roughly 20–30 photos of her that day. I had also taken videos, but there was no video evidence of her petting buffalo or laughing at ostriches that strode alongside our truck. I had deleted those to make space for more photos months later. Photos that would work well in photo dumps — the ennui floating across our timelines now — pictures of the same skies, memes that made me wonder what I was going through when I screenshotted them, the random detritus of my life and the internet that I have been collecting for years.I think about all the photos I deleted of people that I love and no longer have in my life — and even myself, growing older — because I needed the space on my phone. For instance, I don’t actually have any videos of my mother left on my phone. I only have two voicemails from her. One is 23 seconds and the other is only 4 seconds long, a simple “call me please bye.” When my father took over her cellphone after she died, he never changed her outgoing voice message. Sometimes I call him hoping he won’t pick up so I can hear her. Advertisement  When she used to send me selfies of a new haircut, she didn’t realize she was sending me live photos. After she died, I went through our text messages and downloaded every photo she had ever sent me of herself. I took her cellphone and texted myself all the other selfies she had taken. Now, when I hold my thumb down, I can watch as she takes a photo of herself smiling, head moving to the left and right for the best angle. It’s the only evidence of her aliveness that I have.Over the last few years, all the technology that catalogs our lives has learned to feed those moments back to us. iPhones send unprompted “new memories” and collate photos at the end of each year to play back to us, Facebook bombards us with memories, and everywhere you turn, you have the potential to be reminded of things you wish you could forget.For millennia we’ve had to rely on human memory alone. Slowly, we began to augment it with writing, with art, and, not even two centuries ago, with photography. In the past decade or so, our phones have become agents of our recollection. We archive nearly everything on these slabs of glass that we tuck into pockets and cram into purses. They’ve become little mausoleums for the things we’ve held onto, consciously or not. And recently they’ve begun to poke at us with algorithmically selected reminders of our past. Sometimes these are joyful. At best, they can evoke a sad and welcome melancholy. At worst, they can resurrect the pain and regret we have tried to forget. Advertisement  One of the last photos my mother took was actually a selfie of the two of us. Her head was shaved, she had oxygen tubes coming out of her nose, and I was asleep next to her. The live photo shows her head moving for the best angle, and it’s hard not to see the sadness in her eyes as she takes it. The despair. There’s a flash at the end of the live photo, and she looks surprised. Then she fumbles with the phone to put it away.
 


When I look at the photo, I remember how exhausted I was. But I was also anxious about falling asleep in case she needed me. When I am scrolling through my phone at the checkout line, or on a plane, or anywhere where I need to pass the time, I always skip over this particular photo quickly. I also skip over the photos she sent me of the back of her head when we were trying to get a wig made of her hair. All these photos are live too. Her small head is pointed down so my father can get a good shot for me to send to the wigmaker. Her shirt hangs loose around her bony shoulders.She died before the wig was completed, and whenever I look at those photos, I remember writing to the wigmaker asking to get my mother’s hair back. Now, I wonder what exactly I thought I was going to do with it. I wasn’t thinking clearly then; I just wanted some piece of her to survive. I think about the fury I felt when the wigmaker told me I could not have her hair back because the wig was already in process. Instead, the wigmaker wrote, I could have the completed wig, which had already been mixed with synthetic hair, or I could donate it so another woman going through chemo could use it. From time to time, when I see those photos, I wonder who ended up with a blunt bob fashioned to look like my mother’s.My phone doesn’t realize my mother is dead. It decided to feature these photos in my year in review, queued up to soothing music. It doesn’t know that these are memories I choose to revive sparingly.I have otherwise been vigilant about deleting painful pictures from my phone. There are no wedding photos left. Evidence of my marriage was posted across social media though, and not long after our divorce, when I was still getting used to a new apartment, a new life, I was bombarded by memories of my wedding day from Facebook, asking if I wanted to repost photos from that day to commemorate it. No, I didn’t. I wondered if my ex-husband was getting the same prompts sent to him in the middle of the night. In my sleep-deprived mind, the only response I could think of was to delete Facebook altogether. It had become a repository for a life I was walking out of with trepidation. Why wasn’t the algorithm smart enough to know, through the name change and the switch from “married” to “single,” that I didn’t want to get a daily visual reminder that my wedding anniversary was coming up?In April, Lauren Goode wrote a Wired article about how social media algorithms are designed to never let you forget your biggest life events, even if they don’t go as planned. Like Goode, I also have trouble remembering when ""apps started co-opting memories, madly deploying them to boost engagement and make a buck off nostalgia."" These companies have made billions of dollars selling products to make those life markers memorable, yet they aren’t smart enough to realize when you’ve called them off, when you’ve had a miscarriage, when the person you love no longer exists. Goode, who called off her own wedding, was haunted by algorithms following her, dispatching periodic reminders from “a ghost life cycle that you never had the chance to live out.”Around Mother’s Day, my email inbox fills with reminders to send my mother flowers. Last year, in frustration, I responded to one with: She’s dead! This past April, the emails returned once again.So what do we do with these prompts from a ghost life and otherwise painful memories we are besieged by?Forgetting isn’t the answer; that feels just as painful. It’s why I keep those live photos of my mother in my phone. Why I’ve held onto seconds of her voice. When I want to feel pain, to remember the loss of her, on my own terms, I have the catalysts at the ready. Because there are moments when I am gripped with fear that I will forget my mother’s voice altogether. Forget her.The feeling is so acute that I refused to upgrade my phone for an entire year — even as it urgently reminded me that my memory was full and my apps kept crashing — because I was irrationally worried that I would lose the two voicemails from my mother that I do have. I called Apple tech support a few times to find out how safe the upgrade process was. Even after I emailed myself copies of the audio files and the transfer occurred without issue, I was still worried that I would do something to erase them forever. I was already living with the guilt of erasing my mother from my phone for years, trying to free up space for other photos I don’t even remember taking.
 


We’ve been trapped in collective grief for 16 months (and counting) now. And while it’s nice to be able to go back outside — and travel to see loved ones — there’s still a threat of the world coming to a screeching halt once again. LA recently reinstated indoor mask mandates after weeks of climbing COVID rates because of the terrifying spread of the Delta variant. And now, other parts of the country are doing the same. We’re stuck in an inbetweenness where anxiety and trauma bubble up with every report of a new variant or CDC update. In some parts of the world, the pandemic hasn’t abated at all. The grief of this moment has settled over us like a fog, whether we choose to contend with it or not.And all the while, we’re trying to find a way forward, to grapple with what’s happened to us, though American culture often demands that we skip mourning and go straight to the party. It feels strange to even stop to think about the loss we’ve collectively experienced — especially since we're still in it. But everyone has suffered some kind of loss, whether it’s the death of a loved one or the loss of time, the grief of missing a final year of school or missing the possibility of having a child. Now, we’re just supposed to pick up where we left off. Move on and get back to living.But no one I know can even begin to figure out how to grieve all that lost time. Do you start with March 2020? Or January 2020, when the fear of COVID’s spread first began to seep into our consciousness? Or even earlier? And when does it end?I’ve had trouble remembering much of what’s happened — both the highs and lows — over the past 16 months. Instead, time has simply melted together into one undefinable soup. Which isn’t to say that I haven't had any life experiences — I've had plenty, some of them really wonderful, and I’m grateful for them all. It’s just that, in the sea of sameness, I’ve had trouble remembering much of anything at all. The list of things I can’t remember grows longer each day — memories from childhood, what I did last week, the name of the restaurant I used to frequent and love, nearly every password for every website I’ve tried to log in to over the last year and a half.Of course, there have been many articles that have tried to grasp why so many people have been struggling with memory loss lately. One of the best is from my former colleague Ellen Cushing, for the Atlantic, in which she writes, “Sometimes I walk into the kitchen and find myself bewildered as to why I am there. (At one point during the writing of this article, I absentmindedly cleaned my glasses with nail-polish remover.) Other times, the forgetting feels like someone is taking a chisel to the bedrock of my brain, prying everything loose.”The forgetting is a trauma response and there’s nothing new in that kind of memory loss — it’s necessary for survival. Algorithms and photos of random things we are moved to capture have filled in what we can no longer remember for ourselves. I have dozens of photos of sunsets from the same overlook from the past year and a half. What exactly did I want to remember from those moments? The feeling of being there? Or simply a reminder that I still exist? That I’m not living a ghost life, or a lost life, even if this period of time has felt that way?It makes sense photo dumps would crop up more and more during the pandemic, at a time when memory has become slippery and every day has largely felt the same. In a way, they make the singular photos that compose them virtually meaningless. They don’t seem to carry the same weight as the life events that the algorithms have learned to read as opportunities to sell things back to us.Recently, the Google Photos app on my phone sent me a prompt to “look back at four years today” in order to “relive my best moments with memories.” The series of photos played back to me were from July 2017: one of the family dog and four of a sunset I was trying to capture at the beach, each imperceptibly different. My mother was still alive then, and when I look at the photos and think back to that time, I can’t recall how aware I was that she was actually going to die. Or if I was still trapped in some kind of misguided hopefulness. In the sunset photos, the sky is foreboding, just after a rainstorm, so chances are I was trying to convey turmoil in the Instagram story I would later post.When I went to Instagram to look at my stories archive and see what I may have posted that day, the app had the same sunset image already queued up, urging me to repost the photo as a memory. I scrolled to the very end of my stories archive, but it only went back to December 2017, so I am permanently cut off from that summer — at least in my Instagram stories.As I struggled to remember what I was doing on that beach and what I was thinking, waiting for the storm clouds to open up again, I found that I didn’t want to go back to that memory — or that time. I was already separated from my husband but unsure about what would come next in my life.In an attempt to jar my memory of what actually did come next, I began scrolling. I happened upon a photo of a hospital pain rating chart from March 2018 — with a caption I had typed over it that read “Life is weird.” I instantly remembered that I was standing in my mother’s hospital room while she was lying next to me with a collapsed lung. I must have been trying to lighten my mood in that post while also signaling that I was, in fact, not OK. When I see the post now, I’m embarrassed by my glibness.Did I need these memories queued up by the algorithm, fed back to me first thing in the morning? Or ever? Probably not. But I also can’t ignore the photos that Apple and Google spit out at me that make me smile or laugh. Moments strung together that I had completely forgotten, of nights out before the pandemic. Before my memory started to slip. I can’t help watching my own personal photo dumps played back to me — curated haphazardly by my phone.These joyful moments from the Before Time bring their own kind of melancholy, though, because they’re a reminder of a place I can’t go back to. And because I still don’t know if remembering is worse than forgetting. ●

466,“I don’t want to go on social media and feel like I’m not a whole person looks-wise.”,"


The day before filming her first television commercial, influencer Brooklinn Khoury felt “super insecure” about taking a selfie with a zit on her upper lip, so she cropped it out.Fifteen minutes later, Khoury’s entire upper lip and parts of her nose were torn off her face in a dog attack. Advertisement  What does an Instagram influencer do when a key moneymaker — their face — is dramatically changed in a way that doesn’t correlate with traditional beauty standards? For Khoury, it meant reevaluating her personal brand and relationship to social media, which in turn brought her more followers.A month before the November 2020 dog attack, Khoury was featured in a Vogue spread of women skaters, a big moment for an influencer who then only had 13,000 followers.Her modeling career halted after her physical changes, but Khoury kept posting — airborne skate tricks, with a face bandage or a hand covering her nose and mouth area, and lots of LA “hug someone you love today” vibes. Advertisement  
 


Going through a traumatic event made her more relatable to followers, who responded to an influencer looking less cliché perfect. She began earning about $1,000 per post from sponsors. And when she announced her relationship on Oct. 7 with Dance Moms star Chloé Lukasiak — who has 6.6 million Instagram followers — her own count skyrocketed to more than 50,000.Khoury feels conflicted about Instagram — she relies on the visual platform for income but called it “toxic” for younger women.“Beauty is so prescribed in so many ways,” Khoury told BuzzFeed News. “I don’t want to go on social media and feel like I’m not a whole person, looks-wise.” Advertisement  Researchers within Instagram found that 32% of teen girls said the platform aggravated their existing bad feelings about their bodies, according to company documents reported on by the Wall Street Journal. A 2020 study found that Instagram causes young women to compare their appearances and have lower satisfaction with their bodies.“It’s like they don’t even feel comfortable looking like their natural selves,” Khoury said. “I could go on and on — Instagram bugs me so much.”
 


Social media apps have been designed to predict body dissatisfaction, noted Jasmine Fardouly, a research fellow at the University of New South Wales, who studies how social media impacts body image.“There’s the algorithm that shows you more of the same content that you’re already viewing,” Fardouly said. “If you’re already more vulnerable … then Instagram is going to recommend more and more of those posts.” Advertisement  At the same time, Khoury said, she “loves” Instagram because it’s connected her with business opportunities, namely DC Shoes, which DM’d her in March 2021 and offered her a spot with the brand’s women’s skateboarding team.On Nov. 3, 2020, Khoury was excitedly preparing to film her first major television commercial, surfing and skateboarding in front of cameras, but while visiting family in Arizona, her relative’s dog lunged at her face.“It was probably on me for a good 30 seconds,” she said, “just shaking my head like a toy, ripping my upper lip and parts of my nose off.”She stayed alone in the hospital for three days due to COVID-19 restrictions. Her then-agent asked if she would “get over” the accident and make the commercial shoot. She said no.
 


Back home with her parents in Mission Viejo, California, Khoury started posting on her YouTube channel about her road to recovery, documenting everything from her first meal since the attack to how she changed the bandages on her face. Her first video, one week after the accident, has amassed nearly 200,000 views. Advertisement  Nearly 10,000 people are hospitalized annually in the US for dog bites. Now Khoury receives at least 10 DMs per week from dog attack survivors sharing their stories or thanking her for telling her own.“I just decided there’s no reason to hide how I am,” Khoury said. She also changed how she uses social media, such as not using filters and curating her feed to be about skateboarding. She steps away from Instagram when she notices she’s feeling bad about herself, and her “favorite” account is Shake My Beauty, which highlights body differences.But some experts dispute the effectiveness of using social media to encourage body positivity.“I’m sure like many people in the space, Brooklinn is coming from a place of goodwill,” said Heather Widdows, professor at the University of Birmingham and author of Perfect Me: Beauty as an Ethical Ideal.Widdows is vocal about issues with the body positivity movement, the onslaught of social media messaging that urges constant resilience and self-love for all body sizes, and said no matter how influencers like Khoury try to manifest a happier, more inclusive Instagram from the inside out, it’s still a space that embodies detrimental beauty standards.“Often you find that people who are trying to push back actually conform to many aspects of beauty,” Widdows said to BuzzFeed News.

This month, Khoury is preparing for the first of many risky reconstructive surgeries. The procedure involves taking an artery from Khoury’s arm and skin from her body to create tissue that moves and acts just like a lip. The first operation, which will help protect her currently exposed gums, costs $400,000 and requires at least five follow-up surgeries.Khoury said she had come to terms with “rocking her no-lip forever” and doesn’t intend the surgery to be a career boost, even if she hopes for a physical change. “I know I’m not going to look the same,” she said. ●

467,"If you still need proof that the world is built for the wealthy to succeed, just take a look at how fortunes diverged this year.","


As millions of Americans end 2020 sick, jobless, hungry, indebted, or at risk of losing their homes, it’s unimaginable that at the other end of the spectrum, the wealthy, shielded from much of this misfortune, became even richer this cursed year.But this is the reality of 2020. The same forces that made this year so awful for most people helped a select few add immense wealth.As more than 20 million people were receiving unemployment benefits and Congress held back too long on passing a second round of stimulus, American billionaires’ wealth had increased by $931 billion by the fall — more than the entire economy of the Netherlands. This divergence underscores just how drastically financial, political, and corporate systems are built to benefit those who already have so much, even in times of widespread loss, and exclude the have-nots. People with money, assets, and stocks saw their wealth and savings rise this year while those excluded from the year’s stock market rally were too often left in dire circumstances; some tech companies powered by low-paid contract labor thrived while their workers became sick or injured; and the widespread collapse of small businesses bolstered the success of competitors with greater access to resources and capital. Advertisement     Meanwhile, existing economic structures almost ensure that the benefits of any financial recovery next year will continue to be spread unequally without some deliberate intervention. “Looking ahead to the next decade, investors face a world that is more indebted, more unequal,” according to a report by UBS. While top-line metrics about an improving economy will capture all the wealth held by the richest, it is important not to overlook the fallout experienced on the other side.Consider, for example, who has benefited during the pandemic so far and who has lost.
 


It’s hard to imagine food delivery companies thriving when their partner businesses — restaurants — are hanging by a thread, but that is how things have shaken out.Delivery services like Grubhub and DoorDash saw a huge jump in demand as shelter-in-place orders were issued around the country and restaurants were forced to close or limit indoor dining capacity. Small, local restaurants struggling to survive the pandemic turned to these services as a lifeline, despite unsustainably being charged high fees and commissions for orders placed through these platforms. Low-paid “gig workers” delivering for these companies were arrested and assaulted during the pandemic. “We have experienced strong growth in both new consumers and increased orders from existing consumers” during the pandemic, DoorDash stated in a company filing. The company is not profitable, but its revenue more than tripled during the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period a year ago. This trend fueled DoorDash’s successful IPO this month, making billions for executives including CEO Tony Xu. DoorDash listed at $102 on Dec. 9 and ended the day with shares up 85%. As Wall Street enjoyed this windfall, 100,000 small businesses have closed so far. Advertisement     A DoorDash spokesperson said, “Our three founders are also deciding how they want to personally give back to their communities and are each finding their own ways to do so.” She added the company has committed over $200 million to help restaurants and local communities.
 


Amazon shareholders have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic as brick-and-mortar stores shut down; Amazon workers less so.In the first nine months of the year, as local businesses around the country went out of business, Amazon’s profit increased by about 70% to $14.1 billion. “Prime members continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic began,” an Amazon executive told investors. The company’s rising stock price, which has nearly doubled since March, helped CEO Jeff Bezos’ net worth rise by $74 billion this year to nearly $190 billion. Meanwhile, about 20,000 Amazon employees have tested positive for COVID-19, and thousands of workers protested for higher pay, paid sick leave, and better protections during the pandemic.The company has said it spent $750 million in additional pay for its front-line workforce, $500 million on a thank you bonus earlier this year, and established a $25 million relief fund for workers facing financial hardship or quarantine. Bezos has made donations this year as well, including $791 million to fight climate change, and $100 million to Feeding America. Advertisement     
 


Food companies continued to produce meat despite outbreaks of the coronavirus at their processing plants.Tyson, for example, which makes chicken, beef, and pork, saw profits rise this last fiscal year to $2.15 billion while thousands of its workers tested positive for COVID. Tyson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 


Walmart’s revenue increased 6.5% to $407 billion from February to October compared to a year ago, with considerable growth in e-commerce, and its profit was up by about 45% — but many employees still lost their jobs.The company laid off hundreds of corporate workers “in units including store planning, logistics, merchandising and real estate,” Bloomberg reported in July. Walmart also recently confirmed it will lay off 1,200 people in Arkansas and New Jersey in January as part of a reorganization. The company said it has hired 500,000 new associates since March across its stores and supply chain locations to meet demand. The company said in a statement that it has issued $2.8 billion in special bonuses this year, offered paid leave for workers affected by COVID-19, and increased the starting salary for some positions.
 


Some pharmaceutical companies developing COVID-19 vaccines have pledged not to profit from the pandemic (like Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca) — but not all.Moderna struck a $1.5 billion deal with the US for 100 million doses of the vaccine, which it also developed with $955 million from the government, bringing the government’s total investment to $2.48 billion. Pfizer developed its vaccine without government funding and reached a nearly $4 billion deal for the purchase of 200 million doses. Both companies stand to make billions from the vaccine, which has drawn criticism. Stéphane Bancel, CEO of Massachusetts-based Moderna, gained $4.8 billion in wealth this year as the biotech company’s share price skyrocketed. Neither Moderna nor Pfizer responded to requests for comment.
 


As people were not getting routine and elective medical care during the pandemic, insurers saw their profits rise.For example, UnitedHealth, the country’s largest insurer by members, reported an increase in net earnings of 27% to $13.4 billion in the first nine months of the year. The company’s share price has increased dramatically since March. A spokesperson for UnitedHealth said, “We have taken a number of steps to support those we serve, our employees, their families, our communities and the broader health care system. You can find a summary of those actions here.” As insurers continued to pay out fewer claims for care while collecting premiums, some people also reported trouble getting their COVID-19 tests covered — during a pandemic. It’s possible the insurance heyday may draw to an end if the economy doesn’t improve, however, with United warning that rising unemployment could reduce revenue from employer-sponsored plans next year.
 


Credit bureaus — companies that gather data about you and determine your credit score for lenders — are also doing well as inequality widened during the pandemic, with the wealthy spending their money while others lost their jobs.Consider Equifax: On one end, Equifax has benefited from the 2020 homebuying spree. The company offers specialized credit reports to mortgage lenders, and its US mortgage revenue from the summer was up by almost 90%, Equifax CEO told investors. On the other end of the spectrum, the company also offers employers services such as unemployment claims management. The rise in joblessness was a boon to the company — with so many people newly out of work, Equifax’s unemployment insurance claims business earned $50 million in revenue in the third quarter, up by over 70%, Equifax CEO told investors. The data Equifax gets about people from such employer services has been valuable to lenders this year too, as recent pay cuts and furloughs do not immediately impact a person’s credit score, but do impact their ability to borrow. “Data is valuable in all times. But during this COVID crisis, it's become increasingly valuable,” the CEO said at a conference. Equifax did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 


The stock trades of wealthy politicians drew scrutiny this year when a number made transactions based on suspected access to privileged information.The Justice Department did not pursue insider trading charges against Sens. Kelly Loeffler, James Inhofe, and Dianne Feinstein after its investigation did not find sufficient evidence that they had done anything illegal. The lawmakers all sold large amounts of stock, worth hundreds of thousands to millions, before the stock market crashed in the spring. Prolific trading by Sen. David Perdue has also raised eyebrows, as have trades by Sen. Richard Burr. As Fortune points out: “Although some suspicious trading activities have been widely condemned, the fact that no member of Congress has been prosecuted under the STOCK Act reveals the challenge in proving illegal insider trading by elected politicians. Those accused of such activity often claim that their transactions are based on public information or are managed by independent trusts. The difficulty arises from the lack of clarity in US securities law; indeed, years of legal practice in this area suggest that the boundaries of illegal insider trading are difficult to define. The fact is that the law ultimately fails to deter members of Congress from allegedly engaging in such activities.” All of the politicians deny any wrongdoing. Advertisement     
 


And while Congress sat on its hands instead of passing a second round of stimulus, the government paid banks billions of dollars in fees for processing PPP loans to businesses that were impacted by the pandemic.Banks say the cost of handling PPP loans will wipe out any potential profit from the fees they’re receiving, and Bank of America, JPMorgan, Citibank, and Wells Fargo pledged not to profit from the program, the New York Times reported. While banks have laid off thousands of workers this year, overall they have remained profitable despite ongoing economic uncertainty that may affect banking customers’ ability to repay loans. They continued to pay dividends to investors and will also be able to resume stock buybacks soon, which have been criticized for enriching “shareholders, generally wealthier Americans, at the expense of workers, new plants and research, and broader economic development,” according to the Wall Street Journal. Sen. Elizabeth Warren in October said these payouts would deplete banks’ “capital buffers at a time when they should be preserving them to support lending to households and small businesses.”A spokesperson for JPMorgan said the company has “delayed payments and refunded fees for customers on over 2 million accounts,” provided $50 million in philanthropic support, helped “business clients secure more than $45 billion in new credit and $950mm in new loans for small businesses,” helped “corporate clients raise hundreds of billions in capital,” among other efforts.Citi said in a statement, “Throughout this crisis, we have continuously supported our customers, clients and communities while maintaining strong capital and liquidity positions.”These are just a few of the organizations that made money during the pandemic — and as the financial crisis continues to affect millions of people across the country, 2021 is looking set to be another banner year for inequality in America.Please contact us if you’d like to share your story about how inequality impacts your life. ●

468,"“If the projections are right, then we’re already committed to a heartbreaking amount of loss, like a truly devastating amount of loss.”","


How do you see the future? That is the vexing question that Michael O. Snyder, a scientist turned photographer, seeks to answer in his recent project, The Coming Coast.Snyder spent the pandemic traveling around the Chesapeake Bay, talking with residents about how the predicted 6 feet of sea level rise under the worst-case scenario of rapid global warming would affect them, and the places they love. The project is both poignant and specific — for some areas, 6 feet has a huge impact, while for others, not much would seem to change at all. Advertisement  The relative nature of climate change makes it difficult for communities and nations to formulate one-size-fits-all solutions. The area around the Chesapeake Bay, which is the largest estuary system in the United States, is also home to almost 19 million people and includes big cities, Baltimore and Washington, DC. Unlike in other coastal cities, where storm surge is an issue, the bay area is sinking — meaning the water is often rising up from the ground itself — and seawalls to protect against rising waters are ineffective. Estuaries are unique ecosystems where salty seawater mixes with fresh water from rivers, making them an ideal habitat for a variety of wildlife, including the blue crabs and oysters that the area is known for.The balance between the bay and the humans who live around it has been going on for thousands of years, but climate change may result in widespread migration from the area. Already, with more than 1 degree Celsius of warming on average worldwide since the late 1880s, cities are offering buyouts for homes that repeatedly flood, although many residents either don't want to leave their homes or can't afford to go elsewhere. Exactly how much more warming occurs over the coming century depends on how quickly humans stop emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The worst-case scenario is increasingly unlikely as countries take more action to address the crisis, but it’s still not completely out of the realm of possibility.Snyder took the time to speak with BuzzFeed News about his project and to share excerpts of his interviews with those who are already being impacted. These interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity.For more photo coverage of climate change, sign up for our photo newsletter JPG.
 


What was the process of bringing this project together?For the last seven years, I have been documenting sea level rise around the US, looking at both the impacts and what communities are doing about it, what solutions are they pioneering. I was awarded a climate journalism fellowship through the Bertha Foundation in 2020 to continue this work. And then COVID hit...and I had to completely rethink my approach to the story.So the question that underlies The Coming Coast was how to make the often invisible nature of sea level rise more visible. I decided to work in the Chesapeake Bay because it is ground zero for sea level rise. The first thing I did was to map what sea level rise will look like. I worked with Climate Central’s mapping tools and used their data to generate maps showing what sea level rise could be by the year 2100 if we don’t get much more serious about mitigating climate change. Advertisement  Step two was to travel around the Chesapeake Bay and follow this new coastline. I used thick blue painter’s tape and placed it throughout these communities to show where the coastline is going to be sometime between now and 2100. It was actually quite difficult to put the tape right where the line will be — I was just in too many people's properties — so instead I decided to create a coastline that will be sometime between now and the year 2100. Obviously it's imperfect, but it gives you a general sense. A lot of these places where I worked are quite dry right now. And they are everyday places that you might go to, like a public park or a backyard or a parking lot.I used a drone to take photographs of four communities on the Bay Hundred peninsula of Maryland. These were: St Michael's, Oxford, Bellevue, and Tilghman. They all have different socioeconomic and racial compositions and histories. Using those maps that I had generated with the climate central data, I painted into the drone photos where that sea level rise could be by the year 2100.Finally, I chose 30 individuals from around the Chesapeake Bay. I wanted to get as diverse of a group as possible, because climate change is one of these issues that is going to impact everybody. I took a portrait of each person and asked them to stand in a spot that mattered to them, and in that spot I asked them to hold a depth stick that would show what 6 feet of sea level rise would look like for that location. Advertisement  These are very different people. They have some things in common, they may or may not like each other, but they are on the same team. And of course the big question is: Are these communities going to try to migrate away from the coast? Or are they going to try to build up? It is not just a question of the impacts, it is also a question of privilege: What ability does that community have to survive? And it is very unevenly distributed.
 


What was your journey from studying environmentalism and geology to being a photographer and how does one feed the other?My studies made one thing abundantly clear to me: If you take the time to look closely at environmental issues, you come to the conclusion that the way in which we are currently living simply isn’t sustainable. Our overconsumption of natural resources is undermining the fabric of our economy and eroding the health of the natural systems on which we depend. Advertisement  I think the biggest challenge in front of us is about changing the narrative about what it means to live well on this planet without destroying it. So that is where I work; I’m a visual storyteller. It is a really exciting time to be doing this work because there are so many great stories to share.Can you talk a little bit about some of the narratives around climate change — what are narratives that you think should be promoted more and what are ones that drive you absolutely wild?The narrative that bothers me the most is the idea that this is a problem that can't be solved. I think that's simply not true. The transition isn’t going to be an easy one, and we do have hard decisions to make, but our fate is fundamentally in our hands. We have the opportunity in front of us to create a world that is not only more sustainable, but also more diverse, fulfilling, and equitable. So it just doesn't serve us to put our hands up in the air and be fatalistic about this issue.The second, and related, narrative that bothers me is the “disaster narrative.” We know from the research that disaster narratives inspire people to act, to a certain extent, but for those messages to be truly effective and durable, we need to couple the “bad news” with narratives about agency, solutions, and hope. Because people need to see that there are solutions and that a better world is possible. If we only give people the bad news, they tend to retract from the issues and move toward more nihilistic, self-serving attitudes and behaviors. Advertisement  Finally, I am not a big fan of the “us versus them” narrative. Because when it comes to climate change, there is only “us.” And, while we don’t need to win everybody over to the cause, we do need to capture a critical mass of the population if we want to create change that is both meaningful and durable. And we just aren’t there yet. So we have to build bigger tents. We have to create better coalitions and have better conversations. We need to learn to listen to people who we think are different from us. We have to find out where we overlap and build trust from that position. We are only going to be as strong as our community bonds — our connections with each other and with the natural world. That sense of community is essential.
 


What are the already visible effects in the Chesapeake Bay?The most visible things are all these ghost forests. What's happening is the salt water is coming up and getting on the roots. Even if the trees are a little bit further away, it's just that the salty groundwater is penetrating and slowly killing these trees, so you have these huge swaths of forest that are becoming these sticks, like tree skeletons. That's all along the East Coast. The other one is certainly sunny day flooding. It's just becoming much more common now that I can't drive to work consistently in this direction because that high tide, that road is going to be underwater. And so more and more people are making plans around that.The people that have the long-term perspective, that have owned a property for 50 years, 40 years, they can say, This was dry, and now it's mud every day. People talk about farmland that used to be there, and now it's not. Advertisement  Are there any final thoughts about this that I didn't touch on that you really want to make sure get discussed?I had a somber realization in making this project. If the projections are right, then we're already committed to a heartbreaking amount of loss, like a truly devastating amount of loss. It’s happening now. The coming coast is already here. And if that's the case, then the question becomes less about how do we save what's there — not that we shouldn't try — but it's more about how do we migrate meaningfully? How do we hold onto these identities and these cultures and these identities that have been connected to place for hundreds, if not thousands of years? I just think we're going to have to have that conversation very, very soon.Science can give us a really good sense for the projections of the future. But the truth is we don't know. It's still important to work from those projections, but maybe we're going to come up with a really great way to do carbon capture and storage? Maybe fusion energy is around the corner? Maybe this coastline won't happen to the extent that it is predicted. I'm willing to be happily surprised. History is the study of surprises. But, in the meanwhile, we have to get to work talking about what we are going to do to mitigate impact, and to preserve the identities and cultures of frontline communities, like those along the Chesapeake Bay.
 


Jamestown is, in so many ways, America’s birthplace. It’s the location of the first permanent English settlement in the Americas, started in 1607. In 1619, the first enslaved Africans landed here. Here was the first contact with Virginia Indians. The first codified laws and representative assembly in British North America were here. It’s an amazing place to work as an archeologist.The island is a series of dissected ridges, which the English very quickly learned to drain. Salt water has always been a problem here. The settlers, when they began to dig wells, first they had some fresh water, but then, slowly, they began to drink salt water, which, of course, destroys your kidneys. Some historians thought the Spanish poisoned them. But it was likely the salt water and bacteria from chamber pots and the dead. So, living with water all around has always been an issue. And the island is sinking; this place is naturally subsiding by about 0.01 millimeters a year.But, with climate change, things are accelerating now. I've been here for over 25 years, and we used to play soccer right here in John Smith’s field. Now, if you look, it’s a mud hole. And the trends show that we’re in big trouble. It’s something that is happening now because what most people don’t realize is that water is actually coming up from the ground. Even though we have a sea wall, the water is coming in underneath and it pushes upward on the water table and displaces it. And we're always mindful that history is continuum, so there's 400 years of stuff to lose out here. In the meanwhile, we have to keep doing the archeology. Because we might only have a very short period of time before it is washed away. It’s depressing. Advertisement  For the English, this place has a 400-year-old story. For Indigenous peoples, it’s 12,000 years old. And throughout that history, there were always challenges, adaptation, and change. History is malleable. And people often don’t really understand the moment that they are in. But you do what you need to do.
 


This is Horn Point Laboratory in Cambridge, Maryland. And this is the first place that I realized that I wanted to dive into bay conservation and restoration. I'm a faculty member here now. And in the fall of this year, I'll be a full-time grad student. Advertisement     In general, African American stories of working on the Chesapeake Bay have been lost and actively forgotten over the years. I was no exception to that case. It wasn't until my mom started diving into our family genealogy, that I found out that I’ve had waterman in my family for a long time, probably since the 1800s. And so, I think that makes it even more special that I want to do it. I’ve recently started a non-profit organization called Minorities in Aquaculture. And the goal is to educate people, in general, about aquaculture and sustainability, but specifically, women who are a minority in a male-dominated field, and even more specifically, women of color, who are a double minority. I wanted to start an organization to help close that gap and take out the obstacles that minorities go through when it comes to getting internships, and mentorships, and access to financing.But climate change and sea level rise are a big threat to what we are doing. Oysters, in particular, are very temperamental creatures. They face a lot of threats, but ocean acidification, which is caused by climate change, is a big one. But, you know, the great thing about farm-raised oysters is that they're designed and cultivated to handle those kinds of fluctuations in salinity, temperature, and PH. So sustainable aquaculture is going to have a big role to play in the future as things keep changing more quickly. Right now, we're putting millions and millions of oysters out there in multiple different tributaries. These can go from farm to table in three years, and in one year they can filter 19 trillion gallons of water in the bay. Sea level rise is the other big threat because it is going to wipe out wetlands and so many historical spaces, like generational homes and occupational history, in a matter of 15 to 20 years. Recently, it’s been great to see diversity and inclusion as a part of the conversation about conservation. But we need to set tangible goals, rather than just aspirations. The fisheries in the Chesapeake Bay are a national treasure and the Black community has always been a part of that. For me, sustainable aquaculture is going to be the way to keep it going.
 


If you look in our backyard, it’s pretty much always flooded now. Our dog plays in the mud in our backyard, and even when it hasn’t rained in seven days, he’s still muddy. The water has nowhere to go. We’ve got a sump pump in the basement, but there’s constant standing water. And we have a French drain that we built here in our backyard, but it did nothing. It was a total waste of $10,000.Here at the end of the street, you see that big patch? That was a sinkhole that was open for a long time, because the pipes just crack and the street opens up. And you see that gross standing water? See that nice green tinge? Yeah, that’s sewage. I feel like that is always there now. In some places around here, the City of Norfolk is buying the houses outright and then demolishing and giving the land back to the river. So you have some checkerboarded neighborhoods with empty lots. The other option is to elevate the house, and a lot of people are doing that. But it’s ugly and expensive. We bought a new AC unit and had it lifted. But I don’t want to lift my house. And I don’t want to sell either. I mean, it would be hard to move. We love it here. We love this neighborhood. And, honestly, a lot of people can’t sell their houses, and the buyouts aren’t great anyway.And then we're just steadily building more houses, which infuriates me. The people who buy those houses, no one tells them about the flooding. People have come in with expensive cars and many of them have gone completely underwater or been washed away. I feel bad for them. But, of course, you also have people who want to get the insurance money, and they go park their car at the end of the road and let it drift off into the sunset. Advertisement     When we get the really big events and everything closes down, the kids will go out and play in the water and even kayak around. The water is really gross though, so we hose them off when they come home.Everyone here knows when it's going to flood. We all have an app on our phone that we pay attention to. One of my good friends who lives down the street, he'll post on Facebook or Nextdoor, he’ll say, “Move your cars. There’s a high tide tonight.” It’s just part of our lives now. Climate change might be an abstraction for some people, but for us it’s real.
 


This is a ghost forest. The salt water is coming in and killing these trees. And there are thousands of acres of this, like sticks standing out in the marsh. There was once a thriving timber business here, but it’s all gone now, because when you harvest the trees, the land underneath just gets wetter, and it will never support trees again. It’s like we are looking at the very last harvest here. We’re living on borrowed time. Advertisement     As best as I can tell from people I've talked to, there's always been sea level rise. But I think it has got to the point where it is happening faster and really became noticeable. It’s really accelerated in the last 20 years. There’s a place where I used to fish when I was a kid and, well, where I stand today to fish is a half mile further inland. Sometimes I can hardly believe it. I’ve been a farmer now for 34 years. I know one guy that’s lost near 100 acres to salt water. In fact, there's people doing studies just now trying to figure out what crops you can grow best in salty fields.If you don't live here, I think it's out of sight, out of mind. But if you’re here, it is pretty mind-blowing to see what is happening. Already 30% of this county is in a flood zone. And how are you going to keep the roads above water? Because, as sea level rises, you can't just keep putting blacktop on blacktop and marsh, because it just keeps sinking. So people leave, and the tax base evaporates, and houses get abandoned. And new people aren’t buying places down here. I can’t see a young couple making a living down here. I'm not smart enough to tell you how to change this. And I'm not sure anybody can. I do know that we have some hard decisions to make. But if there's small solutions to this problem that everybody can do, then why not? We have to try.A lot of the old-timers were deniers, and you know, I can understand that. And even today, a lot of people can’t stand to bring it up at all. Because, you have to understand, this is heartbreaking. Can you imagine losing your place? Folks here wouldn’t rather live anywhere else on Earth, you know. They’re proud of that. So it is really hard for people to admit it or talk about it. But if you can’t see it now, you never will. Advertisement     We've lost islands in the bay in the past, and people have had to move off and make a living someplace else. The people here are strong. They will do it again. But it just won’t be here. And that’s heartbreaking, if I’m honest.
 


The very first time I ever saw a real live sewage overflow, it changed my life. Which sounds crazy! That's not really the kind of life-changing experience that you want to hear about. But it really did, because I realized for the first time how important all of this is and how nobody knows anything about it. Like, nobody teaches you about urban infrastructure in school, but we are totally dependent on it. And the situation is really bad. Advertisement     We're supposed to have this dedicated sewage system that goes to the treatment plants, and then a dedicated stormwater system that just dumps into our local waterways. But the pipes, they're old and leaky and overflowing, so we end up with an accidental combined system. So we have sewage mixing everywhere. A lot of people have this misconception that water in stormwater pipes gets treated or cleaned or whatever. And it's just not true. It’s just there to convey water. That's all it does. This is a long-standing problem that is being made much worse by climate change. Because now we get these really intense, hyperlocalized rain bursts, that cause flash flooding into these overburdened pipes. Our pipes are just too small capacity to handle this kind of event, so they mix into the sewage pipes, back up, and cause sewage to explode out into the streets. This isn’t theoretical. It’s happening. We see it, and we can measure it.Then, at the same time, we have sea level rise, which is rising up into the outflow of the pipes, filling them with seawater, and causing a serious capacity reduction. So when all of that storm water starts gushing through the pipes, instead of just emptying out into the waterways like it was designed to do, it just backs up, and we’ve got sewage flowing through our streets. We used to have a couple hundred of these events every year, but just last year alone we had over 7,000 sewage backups in the city of Baltimore City. Yeah, it’s nasty. And it’s not just the explosive events. There's a constant low-level trickle of sewage entering our waterways all the time. It’s an enormous, disgusting problem, and it’s only getting worse. And the sad thing is, it’s not just people who are being impacted, it’s the environment too. This water right here is teeming with life. The sewage is really high in nutrients, so it causes algal blooms, which chokes off all of the oxygen in the water and causes major die-offs.I’m the Baltimore Harbor waterkeeper and I work with Blue Water Baltimore. And we’ve got to hold the city accountable to keep it on track to fix this problem. But the situation is only going to get more challenging with climate change, and it’s not going away any time soon.

I grew up in Baltimore. And my dad was a hunter and fisherman. And that's how I got my initial introduction to life on the Chesapeake Bay, that's when I really got the salt water running in my veins. So I’ve always called myself a country boy from East Baltimore.I noticed that in books on the Chesapeake Bay, very seldom you will see people of color. If you did see them, the caption was just “crab picker” and no other information. We launched the Blacks of the Chesapeake as a project, to document the contributions that African Americans have made to the maritime and seafood processing industries. And not only were African Americans integral in the seafood processing industries, but they were also boatbuilders, and business owners of seafood restaurants, and processing plants, and African American boating and yacht clubs. When we started this project, people were saying, Well, Blacks weren't explorers, Blacks can't swim, Blacks can't sail, Blacks can't fly. And of course, they could, and they did. For me, it's really been about discovering things hidden in plain sight. It's one thing to not have our African American history told. It’s another thing to be airbrushed out. And that’s what happened. So, we are trying to recover that and, at the same time, trying to lift up a downtrodden people. And, as an educator, I know how important it is for kids to see strong people that look like them. That can make a big difference in a kid’s life.African American communities on the bay, they often wound up living in the swamps, because that was low-bottom land. Low value, high mosquitos. You couldn’t grow tobacco, so it wasn’t useful. But, of course, these are the places that have been impacted by sea level rise. One of the things that we saw in Louisiana, during Hurricane Katrina, was the problem of air properties in these African American shoreline communities. The whole concept of an air property is there's not a clear title to the land. What happened is that a piece of land had been handed down from one generation to another, but it was always collectively owned. In African American and Indigenous traditions, nobody owns the dirt. We're just stewards. See? And so that value gets lost. And so that is something that I’ve thought about here in the bay with African American communities as the seas start to rise. How will we make sure that folks living on air properties are protected? Advertisement     And so, with Blacks of the Chesapeake, we are now thinking about not only stories that we capture, but environmental justice, climate change, racial equity, ecology. I mean, it's all connected. A lot of people talk about formal education as the key to creating this change. It’s important, but it’s not the total key. You’ve got to put people in a position where they can better understand either other, rather than leave the table further apart. So I try to distill it down to the basics. Do you want clean water? Do you want a safe place to raise a kid? Because, once you start talking about parts per million, they are all going to disengage. So the change comes from thousands of small conversations that brings things down to lived experiences. It’s sharing our stories and finding out how we connect. That is what counts.
 


This is Old Trinity Church. We don't know exactly when it was built. Our sign out here says 1692, but it’s older than that. Perhaps the 1670s. It was one of the earliest expressions of our faith on the Eastern Shore. It’s a place where people have connected with nature and with their creator for more than 300 years.And the truth is, erosion has been happening here for centuries. Places like James Island and Holland Island are already gone. But now, in addition to being a place that is sinking, we have anthropocentric climate change as well. So it’s a double whammy.But when we talk about climate change, the first thing is that, you’ve got to meet people where they're at. Everyone knows that, for example, erosion is a problem. Even if you are a climate denier, you know that things are changing. So we can start with that. For me, having this conversation is about being present and being an example, rather than preaching. I'm a preacher. I know that preaching to someone who doesn't want to be preached to has the opposite result than I intended it to have. So being present means being welcoming.Twenty years ago, we realized that the shoreline was under severe erosion. It was bad. we built a living shoreline here, around the property. It’s basically re-creating a little marsh, closer to what the original shoreline would have been like. It’s designed to have water spill over the breaks and into all of these different kinds of grasses here. We were one of the earliest adopters of the living shoreline idea, at least in this area. Advertisement     But ultimately, you know, there is a natural birth and a natural death for all things. Even for this church. It was founded back in the 1600s, and someday it will be gone. A century? A thousand years? I don’t know. God gives everything a beginning and an end. Things have their purpose for a time. And while this is here, and it exists for this purpose, we need to make sure that we take care of it. And so, we try to be responsible and to preserve things. We may be fighting a losing battle. And if that's the case, then someday we have to be able to say goodbye. Because, I don’t see a way to move the church or the graves. The church is as much connected to this land as the land is connected to the church. So this place is transitory. Life is transitory. Not even the pyramids will last forever. But in the time that we do have, we have to enjoy it and be responsible for it. We are just stewards. ●Additional reporting by Zahra Hirji.

469,An American debt collection agency paid agents in Tijuana $150 a week to collect from delinquent borrowers in the US. We spoke to a person who did that job during the pandemic.,"


Among all the consumer protections that lawmakers have extended to Americans during the pandemic, relief from debt collection was not one of them. While emergency laws allowed people to put certain forms of debt, like student loans and mortgages, in forbearance, people whose debt took other forms — like credit card, auto, and payday loans — had no legal protections. Debt collection quietly hummed along as the pandemic caused mass death, disease, and unemployment.Not only did collection companies still operate over the last year, but they also offshored work to lower-cost labor markets as the jobless rate in the US soared. BuzzFeed News spoke to a person who worked in the Tijuana, Mexico, office of an American third-party collections company. He asked to be identified with a pseudonym to protect his identity. “Rick,” who is 20 years old and a Mexican citizen, said that for 10 hours a day, he logged into an automated call system that churned agents like him through hundreds of calls, back-to-back. He remembered trying to extract money from people who simply didn’t have it, and even one person who was being treated in the hospital for the coronavirus. “It feels bad because I also have my debts,” he said. Earlier this year, he quit.Here’s Rick’s story, which has been edited for clarity and length.
 


I was unemployed in 2020 because I recently moved here to Tijuana. I saw a job ad on Facebook, and I had some friends who were working there who said it was recruiting for customer service and collections. The ad made it seem like this was a customer service job because you needed to have customer service experience. It wasn’t until I started training that they said that we were going to be collecting from people who were calling in and trying to make payments. And when we had more experience, we’d be making calls out to customers. I didn’t know.I was a little bit thrown off by that because they weren’t really up front with it. I was working for call centers before, but for customer service, not collections. So it was kind of scary for me. But I needed the job. So I tried my best. We had just two weeks to learn everything in training. Since English is not the first language for some of us (my first language is Spanish), we needed to learn new words like “deferment” and “balloon payment” and what a borrower and creditor are. So it was interesting and challenging at the same time.I’d go in at 6 a.m. and work for 10 hours a day to 4 p.m. Because of COVID, we sat two seats apart from one another. We always had to have our face masks on. There were about 90 agents on the team. Advertisement  We have a system that is always dialing by itself throughout the whole day. The account number automatically pops onto the screen, and we would get access to the account. But dialing takes no more than 30 seconds, so we’d have one minute or less to see their information and how much they owed. We’d just have to go in and start the call without knowing much about the history of the account. Sometimes the system just connected us and people would already be saying, “Hello? Hello?” I didn’t feel ready to take care of something so important with so little time to prepare. That’s definitely something they should improve because people are going through bad times.Typically, the system would dial more than 200 calls a day, back to back. Most of them didn’t answer. I’d talk to around 50 people a day. All the customers were based in the US. It was mostly personal loans and auto loans. If I needed to go to the restroom or if I needed a break, I could put myself in a function to stop receiving calls, even though the supervisors didn’t quite like that.We don’t really have control over how many times we’re actually calling a customer. We don’t have a system to know. Sometimes a person would get 10 calls, and they were aggravated by that. Sometimes we’d get reconnected to the same person in one day, and we had to pretend we didn’t know or apologize to them. Advertisement  Once, my colleague called a person and she was really mad. She said that she had received at least 20 calls that day and she was not going to pay, that she was over it. She was actually at the hospital. She said she had actually lost her husband to COVID, and now she was in the hospital with COVID getting oxygen and in very bad condition. But really, someone else would probably try to get in contact with her two hours later, and the day after that, because, once again, there’s really not much we could do about the calls.There are some metrics we needed to meet. But it was not about how much money we collected. A quality assurance agent scored us on our “customer service.” They were trained to evaluate our calls. We had our scripts, and there were some scripts we needed to say word for word, verbatim. So they evaluated the customer service we provided mostly according to that; if you missed just one word, for example, then you would get a zero. I was doing OK.In our scripts, first you go through the verification process. When it was time to collect, the consumer would explain the situation, like due to COVID or due to not working, they weren’t able to pay. We’d have to try at least two times to get a payment. We could offer some deferment, for example, or maybe a payment plan. On a normal day, more than half of the people I talked to couldn’t pay anything. Zero dollars. Advertisement  It feels bad because I also have my debts. I also have things to pay for. So trying to get them to pay was not easy for me. Even without the pandemic, it's hard to ask for money. But it's more of a challenge when you know that everyone's going through something that has affected a lot of people. I felt a little guilty asking people for money — but at the same time, we had to just keep on going with our job. We didn't get involved trying to help out [the consumer]; we were just there to collect, and that's something that our supervisors reminded us throughout the whole experience.My pay was around 3,000 Mexican pesos [$150] per week. We’re really close to San Diego, so we tend to have a higher cost of rent here. So, I mean, I am able to survive with that. It’s nothing compared to someone who went to college. But honestly, I know that since it is an American company, they could be paying more.The job was mostly people being mad at you because you’re bothering them and trying to collect. Because of my experience working in call centers since I was 17, I was kind of used to people yelling at me. But it’s hard at the end of the day; it is hard for someone to be yelling at you and telling you mean things. I quit the debt collector job in February. I would like to do something else. I think the reason why I am still working for a call center now is because I’m used to it. And it actually pays better than other jobs, since they’re American companies. ● Advertisement
